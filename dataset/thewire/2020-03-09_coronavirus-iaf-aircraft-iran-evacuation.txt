The C-17 Globemaster military aircraft departed from the Hindon airbase at around 8 pm.
About 2,000 Indians are living in Iran, a country that has witnessed increasing numbers of coronavirus cases in the last few days.
Three days ago, a Mahan airline plane had brought swab samples of 300 Indians from Iran to India.
The Union health ministry was initially considering setting up a laboratory in Iran to test Indians living in the country for coronavirus. However, the plan was shelved due to logistical issues.
