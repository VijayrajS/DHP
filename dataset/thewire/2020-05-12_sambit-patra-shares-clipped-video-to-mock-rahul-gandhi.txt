The words â€œnational levelâ€� were clipped from the Congress leader's statement about red and green COVID-19 zones.

Sambit Patra, a national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), tweeted a video mocking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. In the mere 6 second clip, Gandhi can be heard saying, â€œThe red zone is actually the green zone and the green zone is actually the red zone.â€� Patra suggested that Rahul Gandhi had earlier said â€œpotato from the front and gold from the backâ€� and now he is making another absurd statement. The video drew over 5 lakh views and 10,000 shares (archive).

The clip has been circulating on social media with the â€˜à¤ªà¥€à¤›à¥‡ à¤¸à¥‡ à¤†à¤²à¥‚ à¤†à¤—à¥‡ à¤¸à¥‡ à¤¸à¥‹à¤¨à¤¾â€™ caption before Patra shared it on his profile. â€œAfter the immense success of converting potato to gold, Pappu has another magic up his sleeve,â€� wrote Twitter userÂ @Divyans47789162.
From the Facebook page â€˜à¤­à¤ˆà¤¯à¤¾ à¤œà¥€ à¤•à¤¹à¤¿à¤¨â€™, the video garnered nearly 5,000 views but has been shared with a slightly different message. â€œWhat is red is green, whatâ€™s green is red. Sometimes I am the party president, sometimes my mother. If mom resigns, I will become [the president] and if I resign, she will become [the president],â€� reads the caption.

The above case is an â€˜inceptionâ€™ of misinformation. A misleading claim has been piggy-backed on another piece of false news. The â€œpotato-goldâ€� claim is false and has been debunked by Alt News twice in the past. We will elaborate on it later, let us start the fact-check with the video currently viral.
1. â€œRed is green, green is redâ€�
The video shared by Sambit Patra and a plethora of other users is 6 seconds clipped from an hour-long press briefing by Rahul Gandhi on coronavirus outbreak in India. A video of his interaction with journalists was uploaded by Congress on YouTube on May 7.
At aboutÂ 18:45 minutesÂ into the address, a journalist with the Press Trust of India (PTI) questioned Gandhi on decentralisation. The Congress leader stressed the need for strong local leaders and tackling the virus from the ground level. He then went on to talk about the different zones set-up by the central government based on the intensity of the outbreak across the country and why these zones should be formed on the basis of local information.
â€œThese zones â€“ red, orange and green â€“ have been created on a national level. They should be created on a state level. Chief Ministers [of Congress-ruled states] are telling us that the zone which is red in the national level is actually green and the zone which is green is actually red.â€� This can be heard at 20:00 minutes onward. He further says that since the information is available with state leaders, zones should be formed taking advise from the district magistrate and the chief minister.


The words â€œnational levelâ€� were clipped from the speech to take out the context of decentralisation and portray that Gandhi was making a silly statement.
2. â€œPotato-gold machineâ€�
In 2017, a video of Rahul Gandhi saying, â€œWill install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end. (à¤�à¤¸à¥€ à¤®à¤¶à¥€à¤¨ à¤²à¤—à¤¾à¤Šà¤‚à¤—à¤¾ à¤‡à¤¸ à¤¸à¤¾à¤‡à¤¡ à¤¸à¥‡ à¤†à¤²à¥‚ à¤˜à¥�à¤¸à¥‡à¤—à¤¾ à¤‰à¤¸ à¤¸à¤¾à¤‡à¤¡ à¤¸à¥‡ à¤¸à¥‹à¤¨à¤¾ à¤¨à¤¿à¤•à¤²à¥‡à¤—à¤¾),â€� was shared by BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya (archive).

The same â€˜remarkâ€™ wasÂ referred by an ANI reporterÂ while questioning BJP MP Hema Malini last year.
The statement was a part of a clipped video of a much longer speech where Gandhi was actually taking a dig at PM Modi during an address in Gujaratâ€™s Patan on November 12, 2017.
The complete video was uploaded on the Congrees leaderâ€™s YouTube channel where atÂ 17:50 minutesÂ he can be heard saying, â€œA few months ago there was a flood here and he [PM Modi] said he will give Rs 500 crore but not even a rupee was given. He told potato farmers, will install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other endâ€¦these are not my words but Narendra Modijiâ€™s words.â€�
[Translated from: à¤•à¥�à¤› à¤®à¤¹à¥€à¤¨à¥‡ à¤ªà¤¹à¤²à¥‡ à¤¯à¤¹à¤¾à¤� à¤¬à¤¾à¥� à¤†à¤¯à¥€ à¥«à¥¦à¥¦ à¤•à¤°à¥‹à¥œ à¤°à¥�à¤ªà¤¯à¥‡ à¤¦à¥‚à¤‚à¤—à¤¾, (à¤ªà¥€à¤�à¤® à¤®à¥‹à¤¦à¥€ à¤¨à¥‡) à¤�à¤• à¤­à¥€ à¤°à¥‚à¤ªà¤¯à¤¾ à¤¨à¤¹à¥€à¤‚ à¤¦à¤¿à¤¯à¤¾. à¤†à¤²à¥‚ à¤•à¥‡ à¤•à¤¿à¤¸à¤¾à¤¨à¥‹ à¤•à¥‹ à¤•à¤¹à¤¾ à¤�à¤¸à¥€ à¤®à¤¶à¥€à¤¨ à¤²à¤—à¤¾à¤Šà¤‚à¤—à¤¾ à¤‡à¤¸ à¤¸à¤¾à¤‡à¤¡ à¤¸à¥‡ à¤†à¤²à¥‚ à¤˜à¥�à¤¸à¥‡à¤—à¤¾ à¤‰à¤¸ à¤¸à¤¾à¤‡à¤¡ à¤¸à¥‡ à¤¸à¥‹à¤¨à¤¾ à¤¨à¤¿à¤•à¤²à¥‡à¤—à¤¾â€¦à¤®à¥‡à¤°à¥‡ à¤¶à¤¬à¥�à¤¦ à¤¨à¤¹à¥€à¤‚ à¤¹à¥ˆ à¤¨à¤°à¥‡à¤‚à¤¦à¥�à¤° à¤®à¥‹à¤¦à¥€à¤œà¥€ à¤•à¥‡ à¤¶à¤¬à¥�à¤¦ à¤¹à¥ˆ.]


It may be noted that Gandhiâ€™s claim amounted to political rhetoric since there is no record of PM Modi ever making any such statement.
Therefore, a clipped video of Rahul Gandhi was shared by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra to mock the Congress leader. Moreover, the misinformation was promoted on the back of the infamous â€œpotato-goldâ€� remark which was also clipped from a longer speech.
