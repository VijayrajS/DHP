New Delhi: India registered the highest-ever spike of 2,003 COVID-19 fatalities, pushing country’s death toll to 11,903, while the number of cases rose to 3,54,065, with 10,974 infections being reported in the last 24 hours, according to Union health ministry data.
The sudden massive spike in the death toll has been explained by Maharashtra and Delhi adding ‘backlog’ fatalities to their data. While Maharashtra reported 81 new COVID-19 related deaths on Tuesday, the reconciliation of 1,328 ‘backlog’ fatalities saw the state’s total death toll rise to 5,537.
Delhi, similarly, added 437 deaths due to COVID-19 to its numbers on Tuesday, but only 93 of them took place over the 24 hours pertaining to the report. The other 344 took place across June, and a few even earlier.
The number of active cases stands at 1,55,227, while 1,86,934 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, according to the officially updated figure at 8 am.

Honduran president says he is infected with coronavirus
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, is receiving treatment and will work remotely and through his aides, he said late on Tuesday.
“As president of the nation and a responsible citizen, I want to communicate that during the weekend I started to feel some discomfort and today I was diagnosed as having been infected with COVID-19,” Hernandez said in a televised speech.
“They have recommended rest but I will continue working remotely and through my aides.”
Hernandez had mild symptoms, started receiving treatment and is feeling better, he added.
He will stay in isolation under observation to decide where treatment will continue, as recommended by his doctors, the government said in a statement. He is taking a cocktail of drugs that includes microdacyn, azithromycin, ivermectin and zinc.
His wife and two aides, also diagnosed with the virus, are all being treated.
Mexico’s coronavirus death surge puts testing regime under the microscope
Mexico went into the coronavirus outbreak insisting it would beat the pandemic without mass testing, but with deaths surging as it prepares to exit lockdown, the strategy looks increasingly untenable.
Mexico’s coronavirus czar, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell, has doggedly eschewed widespread testing for new cases in favor of a lighter regime based on a model drawn up over a decade ago, arguing it made more efficient use of medical resources.
Yet as deaths and cases mount, Lopez-Gatell has repeatedly back-pedalled on when the pandemic would peak, prompting opposition-run states to test more to see how widely the virus has spread.
Government allies are also breaking ranks, and even President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has faced criticism for downplaying the severity of the pandemic, has hinted he backs a broader approach to testing.
As well as playing down the need for mass testing, the government was slow to decentralise diagnostics, doctors say. Now that more private medical centres run tests, thousands of new cases are emerging, and not all appear in federal numbers.
