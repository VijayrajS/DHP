New Delhi: India observed ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday from 7 am to 9 pm after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for social distancing to fight the highly contagious novel coronavirus, which has brought the world to a virtual standstill.
Several states across the country have now announced partial shutdowns and imposed restrictions on large gatherings of people as well as the movement of crowds as a precautionary measure to fight the pandemic.
