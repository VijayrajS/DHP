First non-Chinese deaths
The US embassy reported Saturday that a 60-year-old US citizen who had contracted coronavirus died in Wuhan on Thursday, the first non-Chinese patient known to succumb to the infection.
A Japanese man in Wuhan also died after showing symptoms consistent with the virus, Japan’s foreign ministry confirmed, though the cause of death was listed as viral pneumonia due to difficulties in diagnosing the disease.
Cruise ship crisis
A cruise ship stuck at the port of Yokohama in Japan began its fourth day of quarantine on Saturday. Three more people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship tested positive for the infection, Japan’s health ministry said, bringing the total confirmed cases on board to 64, including one critical case. A passenger who had disembarked the ship in January later tested positive for coronavirus.
Around 3,700 international passengers and crew are currently stranded on the ship. They may not be allowed to disembark until February 19 at the earliest.
In Taiwan, authorities began screening some 1,700 Taiwanese passengers on the cruise ship SuperStar Aquarius after it returned from Japan. On Thursday, Taiwan had said it would no longer allow international cruise ships to dock at its ports. An exception was made for the SuperStarAquarius because it is carrying Taiwanese nationals.
