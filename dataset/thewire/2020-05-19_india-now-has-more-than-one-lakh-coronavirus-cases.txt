Nearly 13% museums around the world may never reopen
Nearly 13% of the museums around the world may never reopen, the UN’s cultural agency has warned, as about 90% of them globally have had to close their doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On the occasion of International Museum Day Monday, two studies by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the International Council of Museums (ICOM) said that museums have been especially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 90% of them, or more than 85,000 institutions, having closed their doors for varying lengths of time during the crisis.
Furthermore, in Africa and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS), only 5% of museums were able to offer online content to their audiences.
Nearly 13% of museums around the world may never reopen, the agencies said in a statement.
The two studies, involving member states and museum professionals, were aimed at assessing the impact of COVID-19 on museums and museum institutions.
They also aimed to find out how the sector had adapted to the pandemic and explore ways to support institutions in its aftermath.
Glimmer of hope
An experimental COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna Inc, the first to be tested in the United States, produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, according to very early data released by the biotech company on Monday.
The vaccine has gotten the green light to start the second stage of human testing. In this Phase II, or midstage, trial designed to further test effectiveness and find the optimal dose, Moderna said it will drop plans to test a 250 mcg dose and test a 50 mcg dose instead.
Reducing the dose required to produce immunity could help spare the amount of vaccine required in each shot, meaning the company could ultimately produce more of the vaccine.
