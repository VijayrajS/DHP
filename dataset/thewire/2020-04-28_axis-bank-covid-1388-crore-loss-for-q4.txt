New Delhi: Axis Bank on Tuesday reported a surprise Rs 1,388-crore loss for the fourth quarter of FY’20, on the back of additional provisioning made to cover potential loan losses arising out of the COVID-19 lockdown and economic downturn.
Regulatory filings made by the private sector lender, which is India’s third-biggest, noted that its net loss stood at Rs 1,387.7 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, compared with a profit of Rs 1,505 crore in the same period last year.
The bank’s net interest income, or core income, rose 19.3% to Rs 6,808 crore.
“During the quarter, the bank has made provisions of Rs 7,730 crore including Rs 3,000 crore related to COVID…The overall additional provisions held by the bank towards various contingencies together with the standard asset provisions, translate to a standard asset coverage of 1.3% at March 31, 2020,” the bank said in the filing.
On the asset quality front though, net non-performing assets declined to 1.56% in the quarter ended March. Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans, a key measure of asset quality, eased to 4.86% at March-end from 5% in the previous quarter.

In a statement put out on Tuesday, Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said the COVID-19 crisis would be a long drawn one and  that it would need courage, grit and a fighting spirit to combat it.
“We believe in learning from all adversaries. For example, the lock-down has taught us how work-from-home (WFH) can be more productive and convenient. We will keep learning and pushing our limits to emerge stronger as an organisation,” he said in a statement
As on March 31, the bank’s gross NPAs stood at Rs 30,234 crore and net NPAs at Rs9,360 crore.
Analysts had expected a profit of Rs 1,556 crore for the three months to March 31, according to Refinitiv data, compared to a reported profit of Rs 1,505 crore a year earlier.
Despite the additional provisioning, Bloomberg has reported that the March quarter results are unlikely to show the full impact of the economic havoc caused by the novel coronavirus.
“Fiscal Q4 may only reflect a marginal impact from COVID-19 related headwinds, as India initiated its lockdown in late March,” Bloomberg Intelligence had said in a pre-earnings report.
