Resurgence in Beijing
Beijing reported its second consecutive day of record new numbers of COVID-19 cases on Monday, with 36 new cases for June 14. This was the same as a day earlier and the city’s highest daily infection count since late March.
The recent outbreak has been traced to a major wholesale food market, Xinfadi, which accounts for 80% of Beijing’s farm produce supply sourced both domestically and from overseas.
As three other provinces reported new cases linked to the Beijing cluster, several provinces warned their residents against non-essential travel to the capital and implemented isolation protocols for travellers from parts of Beijing with heightened levels of risk.
