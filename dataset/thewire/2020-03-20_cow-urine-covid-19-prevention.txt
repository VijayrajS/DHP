On March 14, a Hindu group called the Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha organised a ‘party’ and collectively drank cow urine to ‘neutralise’ the effects of coronavirus in India.
Members at the party included Swami Chakrapani Maharaj, who is the president of the Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha and also one of the litigants of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute.
So far, there is no scientific proof that drinking cow urine or ‘gaumutra’ will cure or prevent the COVID-19. The Wire spoke to ‘aam junta’, people on the streets to find out if they believe that cow urine can actually prevent coronavirus.
