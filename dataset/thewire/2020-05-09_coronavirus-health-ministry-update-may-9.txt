New Delhi: For the third consecutive day, India reported more than 3,000 new cases of the coronavirus infection. According to the Union health ministry’s updated figures, India’s confirmed COVID-19 cases rose by 3,320 in the 24 hours ending at 8 am on Saturday, taking the total tally to 59,662. In this period, the country also reported 95 new deaths due to the viral infection.
According to the health ministry, the country has 39,834 active COVID-19 cases, while 17,846 people have recovered and one patient has migrated. “Thus, around 29.91 per cent patients have recovered so far,” a senior health ministry official said. The total number of cases also include 111 foreign nationals.
Maharashtra and Gujarat continue to account for a majority of the deaths in the country. Of the 95 deaths reported since Friday morning, 37 were from Maharashtra, 24 from Gujarat. The two states have the highest COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country.
Maharashtra has identified 19,063 COVID-19 patients so far, followed by Gujarat at 7,402, Delhi at 6,318, Tamil Nadu at 6,009.
With AIIMS director Randeep Guleria recently observing that India’s peak of COVID-19 cases may only arrive in June or July, the number of new cases identified might not slow down any time soon. If India continues to report an average of 3,000 cases every day, it will soon overtake Canada, which currently has 67,674 cases but is only reporting around 1,500 new cases on average daily.
Among other developing countries, Brazil is emerging as a hotspot for the virus. The country has reported over 30,000 new COVID-19 patients in the past three days, taking the total cases identified there close to 150,000. The country’s death toll has also moved past 10,000. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has underplayed the threat posed by the novel coronavirus and has insisted on restarting the economy.
Globally, the number of confirmed cases of the viral infection is close to 4 million. According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 3,939,281 confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world. Of these, 274,932 have resulted in deaths, while over 1,3 million have recovered.
