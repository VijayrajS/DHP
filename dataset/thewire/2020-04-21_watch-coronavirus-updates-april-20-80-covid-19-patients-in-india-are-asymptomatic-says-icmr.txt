The rate at which the number of cases is increasing has slowed down, ICMR said.

The Ministry of Health and the ICMR in their daily press briefing said that of the 100 people tested positive with the infection, 80 patients donâ€™t have any symptoms. Which means they showed no signs of fever, cold or cough yet tested positive for the virus.
The ministry also said that before the lockdown, the number of infections in India doubled within 3.4 days but after the lockdown doubling of cases has come down to 7.5 days. Which means the rate at which the number of cases is increasing has slowed down.
