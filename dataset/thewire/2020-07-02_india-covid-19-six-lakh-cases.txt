Truce too late
The UN Security Council on Wednesday finally backed UN chief Antonio Guterres’ March 23 call for a global truce amid the coronavirus pandemic, adopting a resolution after months of talks to win a compromise between the United States and China.
The resolution, drafted by France and Tunisia, calls for “all parties to armed conflicts to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days” to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Negotiations on the resolution were stymied by a standoff between China and the United States over whether to urge support for the World Health Organisation. “We have really seen the body at its worst,” Richard Gowan, International Crisis Group UN director, said of the council. “This is a dysfunctional Security Council.”
WHO warns some nations still face ‘long, hard’ battle with COVID-19
Nations who fail to use every mechanism available to combat the still-raging novel coronavirus will struggle to beat it, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.
“Some countries … have taken a fragmented approach. These countries face a long, hard road ahead,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva, without singling out any nations.
More than 10.5 million people have been infected globally and more than half a million have died since the COVID-19 disease first emerged in China.
Tedros said local flare-ups were inevitable as some nations began lifting lockdown restrictions. “But countries that have the systems in place to apply a comprehensive approach should be able to contain these flare-ups locally and avoid reintroducing widespread restrictions,” he said.
