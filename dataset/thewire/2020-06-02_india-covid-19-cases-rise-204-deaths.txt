India approves emergency use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients
India’s government said on Tuesday it has approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral drug remdesivir for emergency use in treating COVID-19 patients.
Remdesivir is the first drug to show improvement in COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials. It was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration last month and has received approval by Japanese health regulators.
“(Remdesivir) approved on June 1 under emergency use with condition for five dose administration,” the Drugs Controller General of India said in an email statement.
British government faces mockery over coronavirus ‘sex ban’
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government faced widespread mockery on Tuesday over coronavirus rules which were cast by some media as a “sex ban”, though a junior minister said the regulations were aimed at keeping people safe.
Under amendments introduced to English rules on Monday, no person may participate in a gathering which takes place in a public or private place indoors and consists of two or more persons. Britain’s tabloid media cast it as a “bonking ban”.

“What this is about is making sure we don’t have people staying away from home at night,” British junior housing minister Simon Clarke told LBC radio when questioned about the ban.
When asked if the rules allowed couples to copulate outdoors, Clarke chuckled and said: “It is fair to say the transmission risk of coronavirus is much lower in the open air than in internal space, but obviously we do not encourage people to do anything like that outside at this time or any other.”
On Twitter, #sexban was trending in the United Kingdom. Some pointed to Johnson’s own unorthodox personal life while others pointed to the breach of lockdown rules by the prime minister’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings.
