According to a tweet by Indian Express reporter Asad Rehman, a two-year-old was among the three who were killed when a mini-truck carrying more than 50 migrant workers and their families from Ahmedabad in Gujarat met with an accident at Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur Dehat. Twelve people are reportedly injured seriously.
Meanwhile, a migrant labourer returning from Chhattisgarh on bicycle died after being hit by a truck, police said on Wednesday.

The workers, hailing from Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar districts, were working at a jaggery factory in Raipur in Chhattisgarh. The factory was closed due to the ongoing lockdown enforced to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.
