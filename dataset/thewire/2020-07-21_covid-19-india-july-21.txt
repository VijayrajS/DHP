Questions remain from promising vaccine trials
Early data from trials of three potential novel coronavirus vaccines released on Monday, including a closely watched candidate from Oxford University, increased confidence that a vaccine can train the immune system to recognise and fight the virus without serious side effects. All must still prove they are safe and effective in trials involving thousands of subjects.
Still, much remains unknown about vaccines in development, particularly the staying power of any immune responses and effectiveness in older people or other specific groups, including people with chronic health problems and ethnic groups more severely affected by the disease.
Other outstanding questions include: Will a single dose be sufficient; do they spur enough neutralising antibodies and T-cells, a type of white blood cell that helps the immune system destroy infection; do T-cell responses correlate with longer-term protection; is there a possibility that a vaccine could put someone at risk of more serious infection?
