Watch | Over 250 Indians Test Positive For COVID-19 in Iran, Appeal Govt to Act Fast
The Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday confirmed that 255 Indians in Iran have tested positive for the infection.

The Ministry of External Affairs has said that 255 Indians in Iran have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This confirmation came after The Wire had reported on Tuesday that 254 Indian nationals holed up in the Iranian city of Qom had tested positive. The Indian embassy in Iran had facilitated the testing of these individuals between March 6 and March 10. A list of those who had tested positive was shared with them via WhatsApp, but no individual reports were shared and no confirmation was forthcoming. The pilgrims have not been issued an advisory by the embassy in Iran regarding isolation or treatment on their return home. In a video appeal by a pilgrim stuck in Qom, he urges the Indian government to take necessary steps to ensure the safety of Indians in Iran.
