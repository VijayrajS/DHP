New Delhi: Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal at 9 am today to the nation to symbolically take to their balconies and doorways on April 5 â€“ armed with candles and torches in a bid to collectively battle the spread of COVID-19 â€“ one of the top trends on Twitter for the day was #DocsNeedGear.
The prime minister’s morning speech was met with a barrage of criticism along similar lines â€“ questions as to why his speech included nothing about a plan to tackle the spread of the virus, dealing with migrant workers situation or the economic crisis cropped up. Most pertinent among them were questions which spoke of the lack of gear and equipment being faced by doctors and healthcare workers across India.

So even as some discussed the astrological significance of the number ‘9’, many demanded that those on the frontlines be given personal protective equipment (PPE) kits.
Why did Govt of India fail to stockpile PPEs and ventilators between Jan 30 (first Covid-19 case in India) and now? Why did GoI flout WHO warning for a month, continue to export PPEs? Read this story by @VidyaKrishnan#DocsNeedGearhttps://t.co/PwoUjymtrA

NDMC Mayor Avtar Singh Ji visited Hindu Rao Hospital, Delhi & only he is wearing recommended N95 mask rest all accompanying healthcare workers are wearing normal surgical mask. We request minister sahab to arrange N95 for Doctors too as there lives also matters #DocsNeedGear pic.twitter.com/iNj969bpCx

One expected the govt to move beyond theatrics & symbolism towards concrete measures. The biggest problem our doctors face is the lack of protective gear for our docs. If they contract the virus, who will save them and then who will save us? #DocsNeedGearhttps://t.co/9LbPFkqN75

Medical professionals have been asking for PPE and an improvement in health infrastructure to fight Corona.
But the government will utter a single word regarding this. Govt has failed doctors.#DocsNeedGear

Clap your hands, bang bartans, light candles and torches but remember doctors, nurses & medical staff needs gloves, masks, gear and a government that delivers these. Pls ask our govt. to make sure medical personnel in India are protected.
RT and share max using #DocsNeedGear

Our doctors are in desperate need of protective gear. Claps, bells, candles, diya, etc won’t help them get the protective gear.
This is an appeal @narendramodi. Forget about us, we will find ways to keep ourselves entertained. Please provide our doctors with PPE.#DocsNeedGear
