Watch | COVID-19 Bulletin: India Among Nations Which Want 'Impartial Evaluation' of WHO's Response
More than 100 countries have moved a proposal at the World Health Assembly to “identify the zoonotic source” of the coronavirus and asked for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO’s response to COVID-19.

More than 100 countries have moved a proposal at the World Health Assembly to “identify the zoonotic source” of the coronavirus and asked for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO’s response to COVID-19. China and the US are not part of the resolution. After opposing this move at first, China’s Xi Jinping on Tuesday agreed to an independent inquiry – once the pandemic is over. This is the first time India has taken a position in an international forum on the origin of the virus. Last month, Australia was the first country to call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus and the global response towards it.
