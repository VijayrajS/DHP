Imphal/Aizawl: Two samples among six sent for screening for novel coronavirus in Manipur tested positive for swine flu, a senior health official said on Tuesday.
The six samples collected from people entering the state were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing for coronavirus, director of Manipur Health Services K. Rajo told reporters.
“We have received three reports so far. Though none of them tested positive for coronavirus, swine flu has been detected in two of them,” he said.
Of the two affected persons, one had recently visited China, while the other came in contact with that person, Rajo said.
Being “mild” cases of swine flu, the affected persons will be monitored through “home isolation” and their family members will be provided medicines, he added.
According to Rajo, five centres have been opened in different border towns of the state and at the Imphal International Airport to screen people for coronavirus.
