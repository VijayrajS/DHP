The broadcast is viral onÂ FacebookÂ andÂ TwitterÂ alike. Alt News has also received multiple fact-check requests on its official mobile application.

False claim
The clip in question isÂ WIONâ€™sÂ March 15, 2020, broadcast titled, â€œWorld leaders laud PM Modiâ€™s initiative, Australia welcomes PM Modiâ€™s calls for G20 linkup as well.â€�


In the broadcast, the anchor does not say that PM Modi has been chosen by the US, UK and 18 other nations to lead a coronavirus task force but India has â€œemergedâ€� as a leader to take charge of a task force because PM Modi called for a joint action plan between countries to contain the pandemic. â€œAll SAARC nations welcomed Indiaâ€™s move saying that they want to work closely with New Delhi to chalk out a strategy to combat the deadly disease,â€� the anchor says. Here, she is specifically talking about member states of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) â€“ India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
As far as other parts of the world are concerned, hereâ€™s what the anchor said: â€œPraises were not limited to South Asia but leaders from other parts of the world also reached out to Prime Minister Modi. Among the firsts was British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who discussed coordinated international efforts to tackle the outbreak with Modi. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison lauded Prime Minister Modiâ€™s efforts to organise a G20 link up.â€� It is noteworthy that the US did not find a mention throughout the length of the show.
It could be argued that the reportage borderlines hyperbole, however, nowhere does the anchor claim that PM Modi has been selected to lead a global task force on COVID-19 crisis. She spoke of the interactions the Prime Minister had with world leaders.
WIONÂ is an Indian news channel covering global affairs. It is owned byÂ Zee Media.Â Its editor-in-chief is Sudhir Chaudhary, who is also the editorial head atÂ Zee News.Â 
What global initiatives has India undertaken to tackle coronavirus pandemic?
On March 13, PM Modi tweeted, â€œI would like to propose that the leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight Coronavirus.â€�
I would like to propose that the leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight Coronavirus.
We could discuss, via video conferencing, ways to keep our citizens healthy.
Together, we can set an example to the world, and contribute to a healthier planet.
â€” Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 13, 2020

The first-ever video conference between SAARC leaders was held on March 15, whereÂ PM Modi extended $10 millionÂ as Indiaâ€™s contribution to a COVID-19 emergency fund. Other nations such as Sri Lanka and BangladeshÂ pledgedÂ $5 million and $1.5 million respectively. Pakistan is the only nation yet to announce any contribution to the fund. Pakistan hasÂ demandedÂ that the fund should be placed under the General Secretary of the South Asian grouping.
WIONÂ further referred to G20 while reporting that Australian PM Morrison lauded PM Modiâ€™s efforts to link-up a G20 effort. The channel subsequently played Morrisonâ€™s address where he commended the Indian Prime Ministerâ€™s proposal but said that the matter can be decided by the Saudi government, the President of the G20 this year. A G20 virtual summit was held on March 26. It was chaired by the King of Saudi Arabia and attended by leaders of the member states, including PM Modi. G20 nations pledged aÂ combined sum of $5 trillionÂ to tackle the social and economic impacts of the crisis. PM Modi neither led the G20 conference nor has India made a separate contribution.
The United Kingdom has also not proposed that India heads a task force. PM Modi and his British counterpart had a telephonic conversation on March 12. As per theÂ PMO press release, the two leaders spoke about India-UK cooperation in the field of climate change and â€œexchanged views on COVID-19 epidemicâ€�. India is also in talks with theÂ United StatesÂ to find strategies to tackle the crisis however, there are no reports of a joint or a global taskforce.
AÂ WION broadcast is, therefore, circulating with the false claim that the US, UK, and 18 other nations want Prime Minister Modi to lead a coronavirus taskforce. There have been no such proposals or initiatives. The channelâ€™s exaggerated narration possibly plated a part in portraying a misleading picture of Indiaâ€™s place in the global effort to tackle the crisis.
