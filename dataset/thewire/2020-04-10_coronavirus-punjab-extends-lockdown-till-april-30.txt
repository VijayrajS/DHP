Earlier in the day, during a video conference with the media, hosted by the AICC from New Delhi, chief minister Amarinder Singh had indicated that his government was seriously thinking of extending the lockdown as the time did not appear to be right for lifting the ongoing restrictions.
He also said the government was looking for ways to extricate the state from the restrictions and enable it to function with the coronavirus around.
A high-powered committee with several doctors, medical and other experts, was examining the situation and will soon submit its report on the lockdown exit strategy, the chief minister said.
