Watch | Coronavirus Updates, May 1: India Extends Lockdown With Zone-Wise Relaxations
The home ministry said relaxations will be allowed in certain zones.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced on Friday evening that the national lockdown, which was supposed to end on May 3, will be extended for another two weeks. However, this lockdown will be somewhat different from the others, as relaxations will be allowed in certain zones.
Earlier in the day, the government has released a list of red, green and orange zones. According to an MHA press release, several activities will still remain barred, irrespective of the zone. This includes air, rail, metro and interstate road travel, educational institutions, hotels and restaurants, social, cultural and religious gatherings. People above the age of 65 have also been asked to stay home at all times.
