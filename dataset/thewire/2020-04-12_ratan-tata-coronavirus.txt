The message reads, â€œExperts are predicting huge down fall of Economy due to the Corona. I do not know much about these experts. But I know for sure that they do not know anything about the value of human motivation and determined efforts. If experts were to be believed, after the total destruction in 2nd World War Japan had NO future. BUT the same Japan in just 3 decades or so, made US cry at the market place.â€�
While discrediting expert opinion on the economic crisis in the post coronavirus world, the message ends with a positive note: â€œThe corona crisis is no different. I do not have any doubt that. We will defeat the Corona hands do The Indian Economy will bounce back in a great manner.â€�
Bollywood actress Huma Qureshi too tweeted the same graphic but laterÂ deletedÂ her tweet.

The graphic is also circulating on WhatsApp.

Fact-check
Ratan Tata took to Twitter and rubbished the message attributed to him. HeÂ said, â€œThis post has neither been said, nor written by me. I urge you to verify media circulated on WhatsApp and social platforms. If I have something to say, I will say it on my official channels. Hope you are safe and do take care.â€�

A quick look at the message is sufficient to debunk its falseness. The note is replete with grammatical errors. A fake message discrediting experts suggesting a â€œdownfall of India economyâ€� due to the pandemic was attempted to be given credibility using Ratan Tataâ€™s name.
