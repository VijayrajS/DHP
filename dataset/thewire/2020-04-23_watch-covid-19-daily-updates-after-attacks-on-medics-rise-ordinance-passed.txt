Watch | COVID-19 Daily Updates: After Attacks on Medics Rise, Ordinance Passed
Attacks on doctors and health workers will now be seen as a non-bailable offence.

Union minister Prakash Javadekar told the media on Wednesday that the Central government has amended the Epidemic Disease Act of 1897 under which attacks on doctors and health workers will be seen as a non-bailable offence. The accused, if found guilty, be awarded a jail term of three months to five years with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh. In cases of severe injury to workers, the jail term will be increased to six months to seven years with a fine of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.
This development has come amid an increase in the number of attacks on healthcare workers. The latest case was the attack on the family and friends of a doctor who died of COVID-19 while they tried to bury him in Chennai. Locals falsely believed that the doctor’s burial in the vicinity will ‘contaminate’ the area.
On Tuesday, The Indian Medical Association called for a candlelight vigil and the observance of a ‘Black Day’ to protest against violence and discrimination faced by medical practitioners treating COVID-19 patients.
Following this, home minister Amit Shah interacted with doctors from via video-conference. After their meeting with the home minister, the association called off their protest.


Note: The total number of active cases, deaths and the number of patients cured mentioned in the video are as of Wednesday morning. According to the latest figures updated by the health ministry, the number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 20,471, including 3,959 recoveries and 652 deaths.
