India Co-Sponsors Resolution Seeking Review of WHO’s Actions on COVID-19 pandemic
The resolution, to be debated at the World Health Assembly beginning Monday, also calls for “universal, timely and equitable access to” pandemic-related medicine, which is why, diplomats say, the US is not among its sponsors.

New Delhi: India is one of the co-sponsors of a draft resolution which calls for an “impartial” and “independent” review of the World Health Organisation’s actions on the COVID-19 pandemic that will be tabled for adoption at the two-day World Health Assembly to be held through video-conferencing on May 18.
The draft resolution titled “COVID-19 response” has been sponsored by 62 countries, but does not include the United States among them. The Trump administration has been critical of the WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accusing him of being favourably disposed towards China.
The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the annual gathering of all the 194 member states of the UN’s specialised health agency. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 73rd assembly has been abridged to two days and will be held virtually.
The agenda of the abridged meeting included elections to vacant posts in the WHO’s executive board. India is expected to be elected to one of them.
After the assembly ends, the new executive board will meet virtually on May 22 to elect its chairman. It will be at that meeting that India will be chosen as a chair of the EB with a one year term following the “principle of rotation among geographical regions”.
The board usually decides the agenda for the WHA. Therefore, the India-chaired EB will only have a deciding role in next year’s meeting of the World Health Assembly.

With COVID-19 dominating proceedings, there will be two agendas that will be monitored during the proceedings beginning Monday.
The first one is the proposal for a supplemental agenda item to “invite Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly as an observer”. The proposal has been made by Belize and is supported by 13 other countries who have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
While Taiwan is not a member of the WHO, it has attended previous meetings of the organisation as an observer when the island state was ruled by a more Beijing-friendly government. China has been stridently opposed to giving Taiwan any observer status, claiming that such recognition is just another path for independence.
In recent weeks, Taiwanese foreign minister Joseph Jaushieh Wu has spoken to the Indian media advocating closer ties. These appearances have attracted strong protests from the Chinese embassy in Delhi.
India, senior diplomats say, is unlikely to change its long-standing ‘One China policy’ and will not taken any public stance during the COVID-19 pandemic that would rile Beijing.
The other item is draft resolution (A73/CONF./1) that has already seured the backing of 62 countries, including the European Union, India, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey and Australia.
One of the key directions in the draft resolution calls on the director general to “initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with member states,  a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation, including using existing mechanisms,  as appropriate, to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to COVID-19.”
There is also a provision for the WHO to work with other organisations and countries to identify the “zoonotic source” of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population.
The draft resolution does not single out China or refer to a possibility of any punitive action – which could have acted as a red flag to Beijing.
Besides, the resolution also calls for “universal, timely and equitable access to and fair distribution of” health technologies and products required to respond to the pandemic. It calls for the urgent removal of obstacles “consistent with the provisions of relevant international treaties including the provisions of the TRIPS agreement and the flexibilities as confirmed by the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health”.

Faced with domestic criticism over his handling of the pandemic, US President Donald Trump has lashed out at China and called for an inquiry into the origin of the coronavirus.
Despite this, the US has not backed the resolution calling for an independent inquiry into WHO’s response to the spread of novel coronavirus because of objections on TRIPs related issues during the drafting stage. “It is very strong resolution on TRIPS flexibilities,” said a Geneva-based diplomat.
The draft resolution includes language that acknowledges the centrality of the WHO and expresses high appreciation for all health workers, as well as the WHO secretariat, in responding to the pandemic. Before Washington announced the suspension of funds to the UN body, the US media reported that members of the Trump administration had floated the possibility of an alternative to the World Health Organisation.
India’s position on Washington’s policy of blaming the WHO was articulated last month. New Delhi said that the “question” about the WHO’s alleged complicity with China can be revisited after the crisis blows over, but that “at present, our efforts and attention are fully focused on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic”.
