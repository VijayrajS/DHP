Watch | Coronavirus Updates, March 31: How Did Delhi's Nizamuddin Become A Coronavirus 'Hotspot'?
Daily updates from the world of medicine, healthcare, administration and people, as the world grapples with a pandemic.

The national capital’s Nizamuddin area, where a religious congregation was held from March 13 onwards has become one of the COVID-19 ‘hotspots’ in India.
On March 30, 15 days after the congregation ended, a large number of people from the area reported sick and the Delhi police cordoned off the area. But how did this congregation become one of India’s coronavirus hotspots?
The event at the headquarters, or Markaz, of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim religious organisation, started on March 13 – the day the health ministry told Indians that COVID-19 is ‘not a health emergency yet’ and there is no need to panic.
On March 16, the Delhi government ordered a ban on all public events, including religious ones, with more than 50 people attending. However, the Tablighi event continued and was only cut short, by their own admission, after Prime Modi Minister issued his call on March 19 for a Janata curfew to be held on Sunday, March 22.
