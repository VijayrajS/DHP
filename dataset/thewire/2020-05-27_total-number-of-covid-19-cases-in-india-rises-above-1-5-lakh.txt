Lack of teamwork, coordination at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital: HC
The Gujarat high court has said there is lack of “proper team work and coordination” at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, where nearly 400 COVID-19 patients have died so far, and it is too early for the court to give any final certificate to the state government as regards the civic-run medical facility.
There are many problems which the state government needs to look into closely and try to resolve them at the earliest in larger interest of the people of Gujarat, more particularly, Ahmedabad, a division bench of Justices J.B. Pardiwala and I.J. Vora said on Tuesday.
The court said it is the responsibility of the health minister to keep a close vigil over the administration and functioning of the hospital”.

In its order, the court said, “We are glad to take note of some positive steps taken by the state government… however, we would still like to delve deep into the materials placed on record by the state government with regard to the conditions prevailing at the Civil Hospital.”
“It is too early for this court to give any final certificate to the state government as regards the Civil Hospital at Ahmedabad. There are many problems which the state government needs to look into closely and try to resolve the same at the earliest in the larger interest of the people of Gujarat, more particularly, the city of Ahmedabad,” it said.
British patients to get remdesivir
Britain will provide the anti-viral drug remdesivir to certain COVID-19 patients most likely to benefit from it as part of a collaboration with manufacturer Gilead Sciences, the health ministry said on Tuesday.
Early data from clinical trials around the world showed that the drug could shorten the recovery time of COVID-19 patients by four days, the department of health said.
The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) said last week that data from its trial of remdesivir showed that the drug offered the most benefit for COVID-19 patients who need extra oxygen but do not require mechanical ventilation.
