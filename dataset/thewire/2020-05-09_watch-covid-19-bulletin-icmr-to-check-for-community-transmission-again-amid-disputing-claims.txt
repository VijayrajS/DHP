Watch | COVID-19 Bulletin: ICMR to Check For Community Transmission Again, Amid Disputing Claims
The body will conduct a study in the districts worst-hit by the coronavirus, according to reports.

According to a report published in the Economic Times, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has decided to conduct a study in the worst-affected districts to check if they have entered the community transmission phase. An ICMR scientist, on the condition of anonymity, told the newspaper that districts that are hotspots have been shortlisted. Earlier in February and March, the ICMR conducted random sample testing of patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms and it was found that no community transmission is taking place.
