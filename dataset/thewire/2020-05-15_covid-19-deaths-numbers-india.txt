Indian shares fall as relief measures fail to impress
Indian shares fell on Friday after details on the government’s economic package failed to impress investors already worried about rising coronavirus cases and poor corporate earnings reports.
India has been unveiling a series of economic measures as part of a Rs 20-trillion ($265 billion) fiscal and monetary package, but announcements over the past two days – including loan guarantees for small businesses and free food grains for workers – have fallen short of market expectations.
India’s blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index was set to extend Thursday’s 2.6% loss and record another weekly drop as automotive stocks led declines in Mumbai.
Economists have also said the government’s measures would have a limited impact on fiscal spending as large parts of funding for migrant workers, farmers and small businesses were through state-run banks and financial institutions.

According to the Johns Hopkins University, the global death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 302,462.

The US has recorded 1,417,889 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. Spain is in second place with 272,646 cases, followed by Russia (252,245) and the UK (234,440).
