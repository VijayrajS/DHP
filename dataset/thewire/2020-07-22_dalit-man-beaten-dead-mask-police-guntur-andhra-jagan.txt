New Delhi: A 25-year-old Dalit man died after he was beaten by a sub-inspector in Chirala for not wearing a mask, according to reports in The Hindu and The Mumbai Mirror.
Atcherla Kiran Kumar, originally from Guntur, was driving his motorcycle through Chirala on July 18 when he was stopped by the police for a drink driving check. An altercation took place, according to The Mumbai Mirror, in which the police manhandled Kumar and his friend Shiny Abraham who was with him.
Sub-inspector Vijay Kumar was called at this point. Once at the scene, he then reportedly forced the duo into a jeep to take them to a police station.
The police claim that during the journey, Kumar jumped from the jeep to try and escape. He suffered head injuries as a result, according to police.

District superintendent of police Siddharth Kaushal told The Mumbai Mirror, “There were blood stains on the road and his hair too fell around (sic). The two youths were drunk. Kiran’s blood report shows presence of 122 ml of alcohol.”
According to The Hindu’s report, however, Kumar’s relatives have alleged that he died as a result of beatings received at the hands of the police, which led to severe head injuries.
Kumar was taken to the government general hospital in Guntur where he succumbed to his injuries.
The police have proceeded to order an independent inquiry by an officer from another district and registered a case of death in police custody.
Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for Kumar’s family.
