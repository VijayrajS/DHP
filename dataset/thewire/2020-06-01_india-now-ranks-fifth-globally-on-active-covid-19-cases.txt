Armenian PM Pashinyan tests positive for coronavirus
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Monday said he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, speaking during a Facebook live video.

Losing strength?
The new coronavirus is losing its potency and has become much less lethal, Alberto Zangrillo, the head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan in the Lombardy region, which has borne the brunt of Italy’s coronavirus contagion, said on Sunday.
A second doctor echoed Zangrillo’s observations. “The strength the virus had two months ago is not the same strength it has today,” said Matteo Bassetti, head of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital in the city of Genoa.
The government urged caution, saying it was far too soon to claim victory.
