As of 1:16 pm, the Sensex was down 2,299 points or 6.78% at 33,397, while the Nifty tanked 685 points in initial trading to settle at 9,700-levels, well below the psychologically significant 10,000-mark.
With the latest trading session, the Sensex is not only at a 17-month-low, but is down by nearly 20% from the all-time high of 42,273 it hit on January 20. The benchmark index has tanked over 6,600 points in the course of 37 sessions.
The big losers in the blue chip index in Wednesday early trade include Tata Steel (9.02%), SBI (7.94%), RIL (5.95%) among others.
