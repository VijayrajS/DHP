New Delhi: The Election Commission has deferred the Rajya Sabha polls scheduled for March 26 in view of the coronavirus pandemic, official sources said on Tuesday.
An election to fill up 55 seats in the upper house of Parliament was to be held on March 26, but 37 candidates have already been elected without a contest.
The decision on holding the election for the remaining 18 seats will be taken based on the prevailing situation, the sources said.
Nearly 500 coronavirus cases have been reported in India so far, according to data provided by the health ministry on Tuesday.
As cases of the viral infection surged, authorities have put almost the entire country under lockdown, banning gathering of people and suspending road, rail, and air traffic until March 31.
