Coronavirus: 1 death, 69 fresh cases in Tamil Nadu
Sixty-nine fresh cases of COVID-19 were reported in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases in the state to 690. The state also reported the death of a 63-year-old woman in Chennai, taking its COVID-19 toll to seven.
The state health department told the media that 63 of these cases are related to a “single source event”, apparently referring to cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi.
The six other cases include three from a family which came into contact with a person who had an inter-state travel history.
Observing that the Chennai woman died hours after her admission to a government hospital with respiratory issues, state Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said an expert committee has been formed to look into such cases.
The state has tested a total of 5,305 samples so far and results of 201 samples are awaited.
A health bulletin said 1,864 people are in the state’s COVID-19 isolation wards and 91,851 people in home quarantine across the state.
