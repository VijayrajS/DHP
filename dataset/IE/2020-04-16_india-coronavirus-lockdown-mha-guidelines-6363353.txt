In an order, the Ministry of Home Affairs said, “Whereas, to mitigate hardship to the public, select additional activities will be allowed, which will come into effect from 20th April, 2020. However, these additional activities will be operationalized by States/Union Territories (UTs)/ District Administrations based on strict compliance to the existing guidelines on lockdown measures. Before operating these relaxations, States/UT/District Administrations shall ensure that all preparatory arrangements with regard to social distancing in offices, workplaces, factories and establishment, as also other sectoral requirements are in place.” (Here’s what’s allowed and what’s not)
