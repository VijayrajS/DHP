Pakistan violated the ceasefire in Baramulla district’s Uri area as well, said the police.
Even as the focus of both the countries has shifted to combating coronavirus, Pakistan has been increasingly violating the ceasefire agreement with India.
All through the week, the Pakistani army fired small arms and continued mortar shelling along the LoC in Poonch district. Last week, it had injured six security personnel in Sunderbani-Nowshera sector.
Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik told Parliament in March that Pakistan violated the ceasefire at least 646 times between January 1 and February 23 this year. In 2019, more than 3,200 ceasefire violations were recorded.
