Coronavirus lockdown: Portal launched for stranded foreigners in India
Aiming to offer support to thousands of foreign tourists stranded in India post the grounding of international flights, the Ministry of Tourism has launched a portal to disseminate information about services that can be availed by them in any part of the country.
The portal — strandedinindia.com — aims to act as a support network that has information on the Ministry of External Affairs control centres and state-based/regional tourism support infrastructure, the Tourism ministry said in a statement.
The website lists the COVID-19 helpline numbers for tourists besides the tourist helpline numbers 1363 or 1800111363. However, for specific queries, it has a form seeking individual details.
On March 19, the DCGA had issued an advisory stating that no international commercial passenger flights will operate here from March 23 to March 29. The advisory was later extended and all international flight operations remain suspended till April 14. The government recently announced visa extensions for stranded foreigners till flight operations resume.
Sources said the government is also concerned about the whereabouts of several foreign tourists who came to India days before a ban on visiting foreign nationals on March 13. Some of them had arrived from high-risk countries such as Iran, Italy, France, Japan and South Korea.
“The entire world is facing a truly unprecedented situation arising out of coronavirus and it is a constant endeavour to ensure the wellbeing of tourists, especially the ones that travel from foreign countries,” said a ministry spokesperson, adding that the portal has “comprehensive information on COVID-19 helpline numbers or call centres that the foreign tourists can reach out to for help”.
