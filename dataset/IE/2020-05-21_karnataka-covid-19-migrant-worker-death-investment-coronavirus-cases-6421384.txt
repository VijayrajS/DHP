The chief minister held a meeting with officials from the Commerce and Industries Department to review progress, on Thursday. According to the press release, the officials informed the chief minister that the special schemes are being planned to encourage and attract investments into the state through the task force.
“As many as 70% of the industries that had halted work during lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic have resumed activities. This has also provided the stimulus to the State Government to accelerate the discussions with industry experts and international industrialists on bringing more investments to the state,” said in the press release.
The officials told Yediyurappa that the implementation of the amended Land Reforms Act has eased the process of land purchasing for industrialists and as a result, this will attract investors into Karnataka. Several measures have been taken up to simplify the process of setting up industries at the district level, officials informed the Chief Minister.
“The state government has taken important measures to seize more investment opportunities, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestions to the states. The State has 22 units that are producing PPE kits while 4 organisations are manufacturing ventilators. More than 40 distilleries have been licensed to produce sanitisers,” release stated.
The economic activities have been kickstarted in the state. The Jubilant Generics in Nanjangud Mysuru too has been allowed to restart operations, the officials said. Karnataka Building And Other Construction Workers Welfare Board has provided Rs 5,000 economic aid to 12.40 lakh building construction workers.
