Don’t walk, planning your return: Yogi Adityanath to migrants
Even as about 3,000 migrant labourers were on their way to the state in 100 buses from Madhya Pradesh on Thursday, and preparations to bring back migrant labourers from Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan also started, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath made an appeal to migrant labourers not to travel on foot to their destination.
Adityanath ordered officials to seal all borders, including state and international ones, and prepare an attractive policy to attract investment to the state to soften the blow of the economic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The plan should help increase the cash flow, said the Chief Minister.
“It is an appeal to all the workers to show patience like they have shown till now and not to walk on foot. Contact the governments of the respective states. Work plan is being prepared to bring you back safely after having discussion with the respective state governments,” Adityanath said in an appeal on social media.
Providing details of the government’s plans, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said: “Today, buses from Madhya Pradesh have started bringing people. About 3,000 people in 100 buses have started from Madhya Pradesh, while those, who belong to Madhya Pradesh are being sent in 40 buses from Uttar Pradesh. The exchange is taking place at two points, one in Jhansi and another in Prayagraj districts of Uttar Pradesh.”
The official said only those who report to quarantine centres in the states they are stranded in and undergo a medical test would be brought back. He urged everyone to register their names, address, mobile numbers and other details. After that, their health will be checked. “I will repeat that it will be difficult to bring back anyone without a medical test,” said Awasthi.
Adityanath has asked officials to prepare quarantine centres, shelter homes and community kitchens for the returning labourers. His office also put out the names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of nodal officers appointed by the state government to facilitate this exercise.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister also gave instructions to bring back students from Delhi, Noida, and Aligarh to their respective districts. He instructed officers to contact the Delhi government to prepare a list of students from UP who want to come back home.
Till now, Awasthi said, the state government has brought back about four lakh people from the Delhi border, about 15,000 students from Kota, about 12,000 workers from Haryana, and sent 15,000 students from Prayagraj to their home districts.
The Additional Chief Secretary said the Haryana government had collected the Aadhaar numbers and other details of the repatriated workers, helping the UP government create a database for tracking these labourers.
