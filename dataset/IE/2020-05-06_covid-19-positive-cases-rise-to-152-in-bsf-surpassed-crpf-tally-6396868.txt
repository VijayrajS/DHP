The force headquarters, whose two floors were sealed two days back, is “functional” from Wednesday, a BSF spokesperson told PTI.
On Tuesday, at least 24 people including military personnel were tested positive for Covid-19 at a hospital in Delhi.
The Indian Army had reported its first case of coronavirus on March 18 when a 34-year-old soldier in Leh tested positive for the disease after coming in contact with his father, who had returned from a pilgrimage to Iran.
