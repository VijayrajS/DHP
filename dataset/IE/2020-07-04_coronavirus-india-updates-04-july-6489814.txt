The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was trying to fast track the production of a coronavirus vaccine so that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could make the announcement on Independence Day, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Saturday.
Asserting that scientific advances cannot be “made to order”, Yechury tweeted: “A vaccine would be the most decisive redemption from the pandemic. The world is waiting for a safe vaccine, which is universally accessible. But…scientific advances can never be ‘made to order’. Forcing the development of an indigenous vaccine as a cure for COVID-19, bypassing all health and safety norms, to be announced by PM Modi on Independence Day is fraught with horrendous human costs.”
Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan too alleged that the ICMR’s plans to launch a coronavirus vaccine by August 15 was aimed only at prime minister’s big announcement from the Red Fort. “Why is ICMR rushing for an unrealistic timeline of
August 15for Indian corona(virus) vaccinewhen global experts aregiving 12 to 18 months’time frame,” Chavan tweeted. Chavan alleged that the ICMR was in a hurry to develop a vaccine only so that PM Modi could make a major announcement during the Independence Day address. The Union health minister should make a clarification in this regard, Chavan demanded.
The Assam government has opened a plasma bank at the Gauhati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) for treating coronavirus patients. The first donor was Dr Likhitesh, a post-graduate student of medicine at GMCH, who had tested positive for the disease in May, and was later cured.
State Health and Family Welfare Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took to Twitter to express his gratitude to Dr Likhitesh for donating plasma, and to the team working at the bank. “Glad to share that we’ve started a Plasma Bank at GMCH.

I encourage cured patients to come forward and donate,” he tweeted.

Seeing the alarming numbers, the Madurai administration is taking every possible step to break the infection chain. Since the beginning of June, there has been a surge of cases in the city.

The effort is to early diagnose and isolate, those measures are currently on. Fever clinics have been set up across the districts and people walk-in to get themselves evaluated. The lockdown has helped to slow down the curve,” he said.
