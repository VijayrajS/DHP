All Sikhs want Khalistan, will take it if govt offers: Akal Takht jathedar
Akal Takht acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Saturday said that all Sikhs want Khalistan and if the Union government gives it, they shall take it. He was responding to questions at a press conference on the occasion of the 36th ‘Ghallughara Diwas’, the anniversary of Operation Blue Star.
At the press conference, when asked about sloganeering at Akal Takht in favour of Khalistan during and after his anniversary speech, the Jathedar said: “There is nothing wrong if slogans are raised after the function. If the government gives us Khalistan, what more can we ask for? We shall accept it. Every Sikh wants Khalistan.”
The Jathedar then went on to clarify: “Guru Nanak Dev Ji had laid the foundation of Begampura. Guru Hargobind Singh founded Akal Takht. It is our great sovereign commitment.”
The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal was also sitting next to the Jathedar when he made the statement. Asked the same question, Longowal, who initially tried to evade an answer, said: “If anyone offers it to us, we shall take it.”
Pro-Khalistan sloganeering by fringe elements on the Operation Blue Star anniversary have become an annual event, but former Akal Takht Jathedars would ignore any questions around it.
Installed as the Akal Takht Jathedar in October 2018, Giani Harpreet Singh, who is doing PhD in comparative study of teachings of Quran, the holy scripture of the Muslims, and Gthe uru Granth Sahib, is known for speaking his mind on controversial issues.
Last August, he had called for the protection of Kashmiris after the abrogation of Article 370. He had also accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of dividing society.
More recently, during his Baisakhi address in April this year, he had broached the issue of stigmatisation of Covid patients belonging to a particular religion. He had said, “We would like to tell the government — both at the Centre and in the state — don’t discriminate on the basis of religion while giving aid and rations.”
No Sikh or Punjabi wants Khalistan: Cong minister
Reacting to the Jathedar’s remarks, Cabinet minister in the state’s Congress government, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, said: “I don’t believe that any Sikh or Punjabi wants Khalistan. We oppose Khalistan. I haven’t read the complete statement (made by the Akal Takht Jathedar), but I have always opposed Khalistan.”
While SAD said that much should not be read into the Akal Takht Jathedar’s reaction to a pointed question, AAP accused the Akali Dal of being behind the remarks.
SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said: “Akal Takht Jathedar delivered a speech from Akal Takht on the occasion of Operation Blue Star anniversary. It is always an emotional day for Sikhs. That speech represents Sikh sentiments. If a pointed question is asked after the anniversary function is over and then much shouldn’t be read into reaction to pointed question.”
AAP, however, took on SAD with Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema saying: “Our party is a secular one. We believe in the Constitution. I believe that Shiromani Akali Dal Badal is behind the statement given by the Jathedar. SAD becomes secular when it is in power. But it starts promoting separatism as soon as it goes out of power. SGPC president, who is from Akali Dal, has also made the same statement. So the statement seems a planned strategy of SAD.”
Devotees kept out of Golden Temple premises
Meanwhile, for the first time since Operation Blue Star, devotees were not allowed to enter the Golden Temple premises during the anniversary event. The unprecedented security arrangements meant a heavy police deployment around Amritsar with the walled city almost sealed off.
As the Jathedar delivered his customary speech to mark the event, the audience was made up of Punjab Police in civil clothes and SGPC employees, drenched in the summer rain. However, there was a minor scuffle inside as political activists of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) and some other Sikh bodies managed to enter the premises.
Interestingly, devotees were being let in even during the Covid-19 lockdown in the state. Police relaxed the restrictions in Amritsar as soon as the anniversary function was over.
‘Nothing offensive in my statement’
Giani Harpreet Singh (47), who took over as the Jathedar of Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, in 2018, defended his statement when The Indian Express quizzed him after the function. Here is an excerpt from the interaction:
Your statement has created a controversy.
I have said that if government gives us (Khalistan), we shall take it. There is nothing offensive in my statement.
How can you justify it?
Some people, some prominent leaders, have been talking about turning India into a Hindu Rashtra. Has that ever been criminalised? So there is no need to be surprised at sloganeering in favour of Khalistan. Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh is also a signatory to the Amritsar declaration. There is nothing wrong in any political demand unless it is based on hate.
What do you mean by Khalistan? The country has suffered a Partition in the name of Pakistan. Do you want another Partition?
All of you know the type of rule and governance Maharaja Ranjit Singh provided. Its basis was justice. It has always been a wish of the Sikhs to have a state where everyone is treated equal regardless of their caste, creed and religion. Where nobody faces atrocities, discrimination or hate as Sikhs have faced in the past. They have also suffered a genocide.
