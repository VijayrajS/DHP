Coronavirus outbreak: India, Australia agree to share research efforts
As the number of COVID-19 cases in the world has crossed a million in just over three months, India and Australia on Monday agreed to share “collaborative research efforts” in the context of the health crisis.
Both the countries agreed on the “importance of bilateral experience sharing” amid the crisis during a telephonic conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Monday morning.
The two leaders discussed the ongoing pandemic and the domestic response strategies adopted by their governments. “They agreed on the importance of bilateral experience-sharing in the context of this health crisis, including through collaborative research efforts,” a Prime Minister’s Office statement said. “Both leaders agreed to remain attentive to the wider significance of the India-Australia partnership, including in the Indo-Pacific region, even as they focus on solving the present health crisis.”
