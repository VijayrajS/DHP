Uttarakhand: Foreigners break lockdown order, made to write apology 500 times
A stroll along the Ganges and a dip in the holy river during the lockdown turned embarrassing for a group of foreign nationals who were made to write down an apology at least 500 times by the police in Uttarakhand.
Caught at Sai Ganga Ghat in Tehri Garhwal district’s Tapovan area, the six men and four women from Israel, Australia, Mexico and Latvia apologised, saying they wanted to meditate near the Ganga during the relaxation period.

“I told them that the relaxation period is only for moving out to buy essential goods,” said Vinod Kumar, the in-charge of the Tapovan police outpost.
Apparently not satisfied with the apology, the police brought down sheets of paper from the outpost and distributed them among the foreigners. Each one was asked to write: “I did not follow the rules of lockdown. I am very sorry”, at least 500 times, before being let off with a warning.
