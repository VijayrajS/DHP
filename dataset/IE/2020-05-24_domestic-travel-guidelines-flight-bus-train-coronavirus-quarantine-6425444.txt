Travelling by flight, train or bus? Here’s what you need to keep in mind
Coronavirus (Covid-19): With India resuming its domestic flight operations from Monday and its passenger train operations from June 1 after a gap of two months due to coronavirus lockdown, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on Sunday issued guidelines for domestic travel (air/train/inter-state bus travel).
The Health Ministry advised passengers to download Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones and asked states to ensure thermal screening at the departure point of airports, railway stations and bus terminals. In its guidelines, the Ministry said asymptomatic passengers should be permitted to travel after being asked to self-monitor for 14 days and that those exhibiting mild symptoms of Covid-19 would be given the option of home isolation. It also stated that states can develop their own protocol with regards to quarantine and isolation as per their assessment.
Earlier in the day, the health ministry had also put out guidelines for international arrivals and made it mandatory for stranded Indians arriving from abroad to check into an institutional quarantine for 14 days at their own expense followed by seven days of home isolation.
