The need for extra caution comes as Punjab approaches the harvesting of wheat from April 14. The state is also preparing for a massive wheat procurement operation from April 15. In this case, commission agents, labourers and all other paraphernalia associated with the process would be out and about. In such a scenario, it would be advisable to not let all the residents out, said sources.
Sources said the state had also witnessed return of migrant labourers after the borders were sealed. Government functionaries feel that curfew was the only option to keep them confined to their homes.
The state has recorded 53 positive cases and five deaths. The government is also closely watching if there is a multiplication of COVID-19 cases in the state after the influx of participants from Delhi‚Äôs Tablighi Jamaat event to the state.
