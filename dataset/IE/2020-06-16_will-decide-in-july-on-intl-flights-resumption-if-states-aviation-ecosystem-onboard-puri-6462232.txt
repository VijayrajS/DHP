Decision on international flights in July: Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri
Indicating the Centre’s first steps towards resuming international passenger flights, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri Tuesday said India will decide on resumption in July if coronavirus behaved in the predictable manner and various stakeholders came on board with the plan.
“I am often asked, when can you start international civil aviation? If you leave it to me, and if the ecosystem works, and if we have the predictability in terms of behaviour of the virus, I think in the coming month we should start taking the decision. But those decisions will not be taken by the Indian civil aviation ministry,” Puri said.
Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Tuesday that a total of 2.81 lakh passengers travelled domestically and load factor of airlines remained low between May 25 and May 31.
Load factor measures the percentage of seats occupied in an airline’s flights. India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25 after a gap of two months amid the coronavirus pandemic.
