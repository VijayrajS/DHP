Monday marked the first day of domestic flights after a gap of two months following a countrywide lockdown announced on March 24. Prior to the resumption of domestic flight operations, a number of states had expressed caution at the prospect of sudden influx of people into their state borders as they aimed to contain the outbreak.
“We received confirmation from the Coimbatore airport doctor that a passenger who travelled on 6E-381 from Chennai to Coimbatore on 25th May evening, has tested positive for Covid-19. He is currently quarantined at ESI state medical facility at Coimbatore,” IndiGo said in a statement.
	

The statement said the passenger was seated on-board the aircraft with all precautionary measures including face mark, face-shield and gloves.
“Additionally, no one else was seated in his vicinity, significantly reducing the possibility of transmission… The operating crew has been home quarantined for 14 days and we are in the process of notifying other passengers as per the government guidelines, to ensure safety of our passengers and staff,” the airline said.
On Monday, around 500 flights operated across the country and on Tuesday till 5 pm, 325 departures were recorded carrying 41,673 passengers.
