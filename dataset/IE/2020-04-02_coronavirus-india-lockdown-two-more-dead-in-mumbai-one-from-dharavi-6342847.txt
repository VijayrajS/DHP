Coronavirus: Two more dead in Mumbai, one from Dharavi
With two COVID-19 patients dying in Mumbai, the death toll due to the pandemic reached 19 in Maharashtra on Wednesday, with the total number of cases rising to 335 across the state.
While a 56-year-old Dharavi man succumbed at Sion hospital on Wednesday, a 63-year-old man from Malvani, who had tested positive on Tuesday, died in the evening. The senior citizen, a Muslim, was creamated after the trustees of a burial ground in Malvani refused to bury the body.
The family of the deceased alleged that initially, the doctors had refused to hand over the body to the relatives on the ground that as per norms laid down by the BMC, it had to be cremated. The family went on to approach a local corporator, who convinced the doctors to hand over the body for burial. However, as the burial ground refused to bury the body, it was created at a crematorium in Kandivali.
The state on Wednesday reported 33 new cases.
Eight to 10 family members of the Dharavi resident have been put in quarantine. The Mumbai Police, along with the BMC, has sealed eight Slum Rehabilitation Authority buildings in Dharavi.
The civic body has begun contact tracing in the area.
