In next 10 days, 36 lakh migrants will travel on Shramik Special trains: Railway Board chairman
In the next 10 days, at least 36 lakh migrants will be travelling on Shramik Special trains, Railway Board chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav said Saturday.
At a joint press briefing presided over by the MHA and the Railway Ministry in the national capital, Yadav said it’s a tough situation for everyone in the world and the attempt is to move to normalcy gradually. Over 40 lakh migrants have travelled by Shramik Special trains to their respective home towns and villages since May 1 and nearly 80 per cent of the train journeys have been made by migrants labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, he said.
Yadav said that for Shramik Special trains, the “Centre is bearing 85 per cent of the expenditure while states are paying 15 per cent through fares.”
Shramik Special trains were started on May 1 to ferry lakhs of stranded migrant workers across India back to their home towns due to the economic hardship caused by the pandemic-induced nationwide lockdown.
Yadav further said that the Shramik Special trains will continue as long as there is the need for them, adding that free meals, and drinking water are being provided to all the passengers and that social distancing and hygiene protocols are being followed in trains and stations.
