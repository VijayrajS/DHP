‚ÄúFinally J&K breaks the 1000 test barrier- 1071 samples tested in the last 24 hours. But that also means more positives- so 40 new cases today- all from Kashmir. Total positive cases now 494. Jammu-57 Kashmir-437. An unfortunate death too; total deaths now 6,‚Äù Kansal tweeted on Saturday.

Former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe jump of 40 cases in J&K has to be seen in the light of greater testing. For the 1st time J&K conducted more than 1000 tests in a 24 hour period & so the number of positive cases has also jumped. We need to be careful but not alarmist. Tweets that spread panic won‚Äôt help anyone.‚Äù
