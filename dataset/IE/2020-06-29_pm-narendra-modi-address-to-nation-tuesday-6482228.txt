Minutes after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) released fresh guidelines for Unlock 2.0, the Prime Minister’s Office Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would address the nation on Tuesday at 4 pm. His address comes on the day Unlock 1.0 expires. This will be PM Modi’s sixth address to the nation amid the coronavirus lockdown in the country.
The Centre Monday issued guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, to re-open more activities in the country in a calibrated manner.

The government said more domestic flights will be allowed to operate. Movement of individuals will remain prohibited from 10 pm to 5 am across the country.
In his address last Sunday, during Mann ki Baat, the Prime Minister had commented on the India-China faceoff and paid tributes to the 20 Indian soldiers who had died in the violent clashes with Chinese troops on June 15 in Galwan Valley. He asserted India had given a befitting reply to those who cast an evil eye on its territory.
