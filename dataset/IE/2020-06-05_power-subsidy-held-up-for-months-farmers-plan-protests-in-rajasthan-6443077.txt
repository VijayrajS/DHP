Power subsidy held up for months, farmers plan protests in Rajasthan
Inside his house at Dhod village of Rajasthan’s Sikar district, Prahlad Singh Shekhawat has stacked up the receipts of electricity bill payments for his agricultural connection (general category) which has an approved load of 15.50 horse power (HP).
The 72-year-old is disappointed that like many other farmers across the state, he has stopped receiving a power subsidy of up to Rs 833 per month, which was announced by the previous BJP government in Rajasthan in October 2018 in addition to the regular tariff subsidy provided by the state government to farmers.
“We no longer receive the power subsidy of Rs. 833 per month. The subsidy stopped from the middle of last year and now. At a time when we are already sustaining losses after the lockdown, it would have eased some pressure on us,” said Shekhawat.
Ever since Shekhawat stopped receiving the subsidy amount, the amount payable by him increased by more than Rs. 1,700 for every bi-monthly billing cycle.
The bill records show Shekhawat had to pay only Rs 1,023 for the accumulated electricity charges of July and August 2019 which was billed in September 2019. In this bill, the figure of Rs 1,023 was arrived after deducting subsidy of Rs 1,666 (Rs.833 x2) under the power subsidy scheme.
But Shekhawat’s subsequent bills saw a spike as subsidy wasn’t deducted: Rs 2,712 in November, Rs 2,752 in January, Rs 2,755 March and Rs 2,749 in May.
“Before it stopped, the subsidy amount used to be automatically deducted from the bill. Following that, we were told by government officials that the subsidy amount will be transferred to our accounts. I furnished all the details of my account along with names of the joint account holders to the electricity office but I haven’t received the subsidy even though I have cleared all my due bills,” said Banwari Lal Pareek, another farmer from Dhod.
Rajasthan government at present provides a subsidy of Rs 12,500 crore to 14 lakh farmers across the state in power tariffs, according to present Energy Minister BD Kalla.
An order issued by the Rajasthan Energy Department on October 5, 2018 stated that in addition to farmer tariff subsidy already paid by the state government, farmer consumers having general category connections will be given a subsidy of Rs 833 per month to the tune of a maximum subsidy of Rs 10,000 annually.
According to energy department officials and farmers, till at least September last year, 10 months after the Congress government came into power, the subsidy amount was being adjusted from the electricity bills with the farmers getting its benefit.
Amit Kumar, Assistant Engineer (Operations & Maintenance), in Sikar district said the subsidy was last provided around September last year.
Kishan Pareek, a member of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) in Sikar district, said that shortly after September the farmers were asked to provide details of their bank accounts and were told the subsidy amount would be transferred to their banks through direct benefit transfer (DBT).
“We gave our account details but despite that we haven’t received any subsidy amount through DBT till date in our bank accounts. The subsidy which till now was being adjusted from our bill itself was also stopped with farmers being forced to pay more money in their electricity bills. Since then no farmer has got benefit of the scheme,” said Pareek.
Even though top officials of the Energy department said the scheme was still functional, people working with the department said that the subsidy has stopped coming.
“It’s been at least six months that the scheme has been closed,” said VS Bhati, the Managing Director of Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (AVVNL). Sikar comes under the jurisdiction of AVVNL.
Citing increasing losses sustained by farmers, different farmer organisations across Rajasthan have threatened protests.
“Even the people who have furnished their account details are not getting the subsidy. The government is already giving farmers power tariff subsidy which is adjusted from the bill itself. There was no need to pay the subsidy of Rs 833 as DBT as this amount too could have been adjusted from the bills, as it was being done till last year. The way this scheme has been stopped shows that the incumbent state government is not willing to release this subsidy for farmers. We have planned a state-wide protest on June 8 and the stopping of this subsidy is one of the issues we are raising,” said Amra Ram, former CPI (M) MLA from Sikar district and vice president, AIKS.
More than 300 kilometres away from Sikar, the non-receipt of the subsidy has become an issue in rural Jodhpur as well.
“We haven’t received the subsidy for around 7-8 months. Since most farmers here cultivate jointly in partnership with other farmers, it suits us better if the subsidy is deducted from the bill instead of direct benefit transfer as it reduces any scope of dispute with farmers. However, even people who have furnished account details are not getting it ever since it was stopped. We have decided to boycott paying of electricity bills till we receive the subsidy and our pending subsidies are cleared,” said Chainaram Bhambu, a farmer from Tinvri in Jodhpur.
On Sunday, Manilal Labana, the state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a farmer outfit affiliated to the RSS, wrote a letter to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot requesting that the pending subsidies of the Rs 833 per month scheme be released to farmers.
The BKS wrote in the letter that farmers have been forced to boycott payment of electricity bills after the subsidy was stopped and penalties were added to it.
“The money for the subsidy is to be given by the government. We had paid the subsidies till September-October last year. Since the account number of every agriculturist is not there, permission was given to adjust this amount directly from the bills of farmers, even though it was supposed to be transferred through DBT to their accounts. Since then we haven’t received the subsidy from the government. We have sent proposals to the government, asking for clarification about what is the further course of action. This is an issue of the government, not the discom. If the government provides us the subsidy, we will transfer it to the farmers,” Avinash Singhvi, the Managing Director of Jodhpur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd, told The Indian Express.
A circular of the Energy Department dated November 15, 2019, mentions that due to some ‘practical difficulties’ the transfer of this subsidy couldn’t be started through DBT.
“The scheme is functional. The subsidy was to be transferred through DBT. Many farmers haven’t matched their accounts with their K numbers (ID given to each consumer) because of which they are not receiving the subsidy. There are some issues. For example, in several cases the agricultural connection is in the name of someone from a family while the account is in the name of some other family member. We are updating and sorting these issues,” said Ajitabh Sharma, the Principal Secretary in Energy Department.
“Actually after the electricity tariffs were hiked this year, the government decided to bear the entire cost of that for farmers so that this additional load doesn’t fall on the agriculturists. Since this additional burden has come upon the government after the tariff hike, we are considering our way forward with the Rs 833 per month scheme and the matter is being examined,” Rajasthan Energy Minister BD Kalla told The Indian Express.
Back in February, after electricity tariffs in several categories of consumers were hiked by the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC), Kalla had said that the government would bear the entire additional burden of Rs 2,347 crore on farmers which resulted from the tariff hike.
This announcement was done because of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s decision that for the next five years, any increase in the electricity rates for farmers will be borne by the government.
