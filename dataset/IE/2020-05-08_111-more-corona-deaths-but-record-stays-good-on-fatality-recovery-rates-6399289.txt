“States need to focus on more effective surveillance, contact tracing and early diagnosis to keep the fatality rate low. Surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections /Influenza Like Illnesses should be intensified in unaffected districts and districts which have not reported cases for the last 14 days and more, through the IDSP network in collaboration with medical college hospitals. Such measures will help indicate the presence of any possible hidden infection at an early stage,” Vardhan said.
