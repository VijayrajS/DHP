Coronavirus: Telangana limits release of info, officials deny clampdown charge
As the number of COVID-19 cases in Telangana rises, the state government has limited the information being shared about the outbreak on a day-to-day basis.
Till the number of cases was around 45, the state government had been releasing daily information on the number of fresh cases, the number of people under quarantine and the steps being taken to tackle the outbreak.
However, after the number of fresh cases daily went up, the government limited the information provided. On Monday, the government first said in a release there were two new cases, Within minutes, the CMO issued another release, stating that five persons from the state died of COVID-19.
On Tuesday, a late release by Health Minister Etela Rajender â€” but not with his official letterhead â€” stated 15 fresh cases had been reported in the state. Those who tested positive either attended the Tabhligi Jamaat meeting in Delhi or came in contact with those who did, said the release.
The release, however, did not provide information about the districts the dead, or those who have tested positive, belong to or their travel history.
Asked why information on the number of people who attended the jamaat and those who are showing symptoms was not released, Rajender said the data is still being compiled.
G Srinivas Rao, Chief Director of Public Health, said that information was being released only after proper verification and that is why there was some delay.
