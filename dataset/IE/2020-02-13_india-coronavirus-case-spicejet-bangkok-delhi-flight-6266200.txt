Coronavirus: Two fliers referred to hospital at Kolkata airport, another quarantined in Delhi
Two passengers who arrived at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata from Bangkok were referred to a hospital after they showed symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection, airport officials said on Thursday.
Meanwhile, in New Delhi, an Indian citizen onboard a Bangkok-Delhi SpiceJet flight was quarantined at IGI airport on suspicions of the viral infection, an airline spokesperson said.
A SpiceJet official said, “The passenger onboard the Bangkok-Delhi flight was seated on seat number 31F and was the only passenger in that row. The said passenger was quarantined by the Airport Health Organisation (APHO) after landing in Delhi.”
This came a day after two Indians tested positive on a cruise ship off the coast of Japan.
The Centre has advised screening of passengers at 21 airports, international seaports and border crossings across the country. According to the latest available official data, more than 1,700 flights and over 1.80 lakh passengers have been screened across airports so far.
Last week, a Chinese national was suspected to be infected after he fell ill on board an Air India flight. Upon arrival at Pune airport, he was taken to a local hospital.
