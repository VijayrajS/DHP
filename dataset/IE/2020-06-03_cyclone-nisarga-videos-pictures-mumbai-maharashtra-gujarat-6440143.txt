Watch: Cyclone Nisarga makes landfall, heavy rain in Alibagh
Cyclone Nisarga made landfall near Maharashtra’s Raigad district at around 12.30 pm Wednesday. The process will be completed in three hours, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) said. The storm lies 40 km south of Alibagh, 95 km south of Mumbai and 325 km south of Surat (Gujarat).
This is the second cyclone to strike India in two weeks and the first to hit Mumbai in June in over 100 years. Nisarga is also only the second time since 1902 that a cyclone has developed over the Arabian Sea in June in two consecutive years.
Strong winds have been prevailing over most parts of Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Pune, Palghar, Ratnagiri and Raigad since Wednesday morning. The IMD has issued a red alert in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Dhule, Nandurbar, and Nashik districts of Maharashtra, which indicates the “possibility of extremely heavy rain at isolated places”. Thousands were evacuated in Maharashtra and Gujarat, two states that are hit the worst by the coronavirus pandemic.
