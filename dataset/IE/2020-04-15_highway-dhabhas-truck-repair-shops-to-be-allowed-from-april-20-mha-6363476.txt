Highway dhabhas, truck repair shops to be allowed from April 20: MHA
Dhabas on highways, truck repair shops, and trucks carrying goods, will be allowed to operate, albeit with social distancing norms, from April 20, as per the government’s directive on the relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown in areas which are not demarcated “containment zones” in India.
As mentioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Tuesday, the Home Ministry today morning issued a detailed guideline of lockdown relaxation so that economic activity can resume even while adhering to outbreak mitigation measures.
All goods traffic will be allowed to ply, the directive from the Home Ministry says, taking away any distinction between essential and non-essential items. The notification says that states cannot further dilute these relaxation measures but can make stricter rules of their own.
