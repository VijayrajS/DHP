MP seeks advance notice from states
The state government on Saturday wrote to Chief Ministers of seven states seeking advance intimation of the movement of migrant workers.
â€œThough we are arranging food, vehicles and medicines free of cost to the migrants, the system falls apart because we donâ€™t get to know how many are reaching MP, at what time and by what means (of transport),â€™â€™ Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote to his counterparts in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Telangana and Chhattisgarh.
â€œIn the absence of advance intimation, many workers arrive simultaneously, derailing the arrangement. Many workers get disturbed and create law and order situation. They themselves suffer due to this,â€™â€™ said Chouhan, highlighting the lack of coordination between the states. On Saturday, he asked collectors to ensure that workers travelling on overloaded trucks are made to get off, and vehicles arranged for their onward journey.
