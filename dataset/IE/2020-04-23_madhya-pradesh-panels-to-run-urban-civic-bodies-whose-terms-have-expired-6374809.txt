Madhya Pradesh: Panels to run urban civic bodies whose terms have expired
The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has decided to form administrative committees to manage the affairs of urban bodies whose terms have expired and elections have not been held.
In doing so, it has undone the previous Congress government’s decision to appoint officials as administrators.
The administrative committees will function for one year or until elections are held, whichever is earlier.
The Opposition Congress called the decision unconstitutional. Former CM Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said the party will challenge the decision in court after studying different aspects. “How can you replace administrators with elected members whose terms have expired?” asked Congress leader Bhupendra Gupta.
Welcoming the decision, state BJP president V D Sharma said, “The committees will be able to establish better coordination between people and bodies and monitor works.”
Chouhan allocates portfolios

Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists Tulsiram Silawat and Govind Rajput were given charge of Water Resources and Cooperatives portfolios, respectively.
Silawat held the Health portfolio in the Kamal Nath government while Rajput was Revenue and Transport minister. Both had resigned as MLAs and will have to win elections to validate their stay in office.
