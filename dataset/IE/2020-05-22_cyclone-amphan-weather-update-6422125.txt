Cyclone Amphan: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced an immediate advanced relief of Rs 1,000 crore for West Bengal and Rs 500 crore for Odisha after he held an aerial survey to asses the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan which claimed 77 lives in West Bengal.

Here is a look at the latest developments:

The cyclone hit Bengal and Odisha at a time when it is already struggling to fight the transmission of the novel coronavirus.
