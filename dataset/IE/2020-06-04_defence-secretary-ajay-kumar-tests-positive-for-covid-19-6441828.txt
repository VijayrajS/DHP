Defence secretary Ajay Kumar tests positive for Covid-19
Defence secretary Ajay Kumar has tested positive for Covid-19 and is under home quarantine. He was tested after developing mild fever and the results came on Tuesday.
Kumar is the first top government official to test positive for the disease. It is not clear if other senior bureaucrats, military officials and ministers whom he came in contact with, have been tested so far.
Defence ministry has not issued a statement on the matter so far.
At least 35 officials working at the ministryâ€™s headquarters in South Block in the Raisina Hills have been sent on home quarantine after reports of Kumar testing positive for the infection emerged, news agency PTI reported.
	

PTI, quoting official sources, said the defence ministry has carried out a massive contact-tracing exercise. The first floor of the South Block is also being sanitised.
