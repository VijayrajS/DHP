Lockdown restrictions after April 20: Here’s the list of what opens and what does not
To “mitigate the hardship” of the  citizens are facing during the nationwide lockdown, a number of restrictions, currently in place, will be eased with effect from Monday. Barring the containment zones demarcated by the states, people across the country will be able to enjoy certain relaxations while abiding by the safety measures such as social distancing and mandatory use of masks.
Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended 21-day lockdown to 40, Ministry of Home Affairs had issued fresh guidelines mentioning the select additional activities that will be allowed from April 20.

They will, however, be allowed to continue supplying essentials.
