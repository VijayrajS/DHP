Coronavirus lockdown: Pinarayi urges PM Modi to help bring back stranded expatriates
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said the state wants to bring back people from the state who are stranded abroad following the international travel ban in view of the pandemic and urged the Union government to prepare a rehabilitation package for expatriates who have lost jobs.
After a review meeting on Monday, Vijayan said the issue has been brought to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attention, and that a letter was sent to him on Monday, urging him to send special aircraft to bring those expatriates back.
Vijayan said, “What worries us most is the problem of expatriates (stranded) in other countries. We want to bring them back home at the earliest…”
He said scores of people are stranded abroad following the travel ban, as are many people who were visiting another country. Without any income, survival has become difficult for these people, he said.

Vijayan said the state wants to bring them back after following the international health protocol. The state, he said, is ready to look after the testing and quarantine of people who are brought back. In the present condition, he said, the Prime Minister has been told that an intervention for the expatriates is inevitable.
