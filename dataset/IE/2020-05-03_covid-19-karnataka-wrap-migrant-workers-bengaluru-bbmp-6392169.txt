KSRTC buses help intra-state migrant labourers reach home for free
A day after drawing widespread criticism for demanding inflated fares from migrant workers for their travel back home to rural areas in the state, the Karnataka government arranged hundreds of buses for the same free of cost on Sunday.

BBMP bats for ward-wise COVID-19 zoning
Even as Bengaluru Urban district falls under red zones in the district-wise categorisation by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) as relaxations were announced in lockdown restrictions from May 4, local civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has written to the MHA demanding that zoning needs to be done at the ward-level in the Karnataka capital.
BBMP Commissioner B H Anil Kumar confirmed that the decision was taken as the spread of the novel coronavirus in Bengaluru is contained in a small geographic area as compared to other cities in India.
‚ÄúOut of 198 wards, 177 wards do not have any positive cases at the moment. Containment zones have been identified only 21 wards within BBMP limits. Since Bengaluru (Urban) is classified as a ‚ÄòRed Zone‚Äô we have written a letter to MHA seeking permission to get relaxations in all other wards which are free of the pandemic,‚Äù Anil Kumar said.
