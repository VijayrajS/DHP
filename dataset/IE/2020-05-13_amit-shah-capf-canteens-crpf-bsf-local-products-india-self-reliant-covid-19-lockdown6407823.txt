CAPF canteens to sell only local products from June 1: MHA
Following PM Narendra Modi’s call to go “vocal for local”, the Ministry of Home Affairs has asked all paramilitary forces to use only Made in Indian products. In an order issued on Wednesday, the Ministry has asked central armed police forces’ (CAPFs) canteens to “sell only indigenous products” beginning June 1.
The total purchase value of CAPF canteens, the MHA said, would be around Rs 2,800 crore. “With this decision, 50 lakh family members of about 10 lakh CAPF personnel will use indigenous products,” an MHA statement said.
Referring to Modi’s address to the nation on Tuesday about making India self-reliant, the MHA statement said, “In this direction today, the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided that all the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) canteens and stores across the country will now sell only indigenous products, from June 1, 2020.”
Sources in the CAPF’s said the forces were still waiting for detailed guidelines on what were to constitute “indigenous products” from the ministry. A Home Ministry official clarified that by “indigenous products”, the ministry meant “made in India” products.
Sources in CAPFs said the canteens already had “made in India” products almost entirely. “Even if it is a foreign company, the products that are sold in the canteen are manufactured in India,” a CAPF officer said.
The canteens sell all kinds of products, ranging from grocery items to electronics to cars. “If the ministry means ‘made in India’, it won’t make much of a difference, as barring certain electronic items such as phones and laptops —that too of a few companies — hardly any imported item is sold in the canteens. Even the cars are sourced from Mahindra,” another CAPF officer said.
This is the second time that MHA has pushed Swadeshi into CAPF canteens. Last year, when Home Minister Amit Shah had visited CAPF headquarters for the first time, he had pushed for indigenous products in canteens. Following this, the canteens began sourcing a large number of products from Khadi Gramodyog, sources said.
The Home Minister also appealed to the people of the country and said, “You should use the products made in the country as much as possible and encourage others to do the same. This is not the time to lag behind, but to turn the crisis into an opportunity.”
Shah has described PM’s appeal as a guiding light to make India the Global Leader in future. According to Shah, if every Indian pledges to use products made in India (Swadeshi), the country can become self-sufficient in next five years.
Appealing to the people of the country, the Home Minister said, “Let us all strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Modi in this journey of making India self-reliant, by using indigenous products.”
