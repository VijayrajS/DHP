Coronavirus India Updates, 24 May: Uttar Pradesh to set up Migration Commission to employ labourers
Coronavirus India Updates: With nearly 7,000 fresh cases, the Covid-19 tally in India rose to 1,31,868 on Sunday, a day before the country reopens its skies for over 350 domestic flights after nearly two months. At least 147 fatalities were recorded within a span of 24 hours, taking the total to 3,867.
Meanwhile, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray today said it was wrong to impose the lockdown suddenly and that it cannot be lifted all at once. “It was wrong to impose the lockdown suddenly. It will be equally wrong to lift it in one go. It will be a double whammy for our own people,” he said in a televised message.
While the number of active cases rose to 73,560, around 54,440 people have recovered and one patient has migrated to another country, the latest bulletin released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare read. Of the total death toll of 3,867, Maharashtra tops the tally with 1,577 deaths, followed by Gujarat at 829, Madhya Pradesh at 281, West Bengal at 269 and Delhi at 231.
The state of Maharashtra continues to be worst-affected in the country as it recorded over 3,000 cases on Sunday, taking the state tally to over 50,000. With 58 deaths due to the pandemic reported during the day, the death toll in the state rose to 1635.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday issued an order to prepare a framework for setting up a Migration Commission to employ labourers. Under this Commission, social security will be guaranteed to the labourers by providing employment to them, Adityanath said.

As the state continued to top the COVID chart, Chief Minister Thackeray on said the ongoing lockdown may not be lifted on May 31.
“We can’t say that the lockdown will be over by May 31st. We will have to see how we can go forward. The coming time is crucial as the multiplication of virus is picking up. I want to assure the medical fraternity that we are with them in all ways,” he told reporters.
“This morning, I spoke to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and requested him to give us some time for preparations to resume air travel,” he added.

With the country set to reopen its skies, as many as 380 flights are scheduled to resume operations at the Delhi airport on Monday, a senior official said.
“Delhi airport will be handling around 380 domestic flights on Monday. There will be 190 departures and around 190 arrivals,” the official was quoted as saying by PTI.
“Delhi Airport is all set to open for commercial flight operations after a two-month shutdown, and we have implemented several unique initiatives to ensure passengers safety without compromising their comfort and experience. Our teams have worked round-the-clock to sanitise the vast terminal… and DIAL will continue… encouraging passengers to maintain social distancing at the airport,” Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, Delhi International Airport Limited CEO said.
Even as airlines prepared to resume operations, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday said it is “extremely ill-advised” to reopen airports in red zone amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Taking to Twitter, he said: “Its extremely ill-advised to reopen airports in red zone. Mere thermal scanning of passengers inadequate w/o swabs. Impossible to have autos/cabs/buses ply in current circumstances. Adding positive passenger will add Covid stress to red zone.”
“Getting passengers to come from a green zone to a red one putting them to risk of exposure doesn’t make sense. Keeping a busy airport up & running with all Covid-safety measures will need huge staff presence and compound risk in the red zone,” he added.
Around 3,300 residents of Jammu and Kashmir, including 1,200 students who were stranded in different parts of Maharashtra, have returned home in four Shramik Special trains in the past 10 days, an official spokesperson said.
This is the highest number of Shramik Special trains deployed by a single state for the evacuation of J&K residents stranded there, he added.
“Around 600 stranded people from J&K including 200 students left for Udhampur railway station (J&K) from Bandra terminus, Mumbai Saturday evening in the fourth and last Shramik Special train (for JK residents there). The train carried the J&K residents who were mostly stranded in two key districts of Mumbai city and Mumbai suburban,” he was quoted as saying by PTI on Saturday.
Health infrastructure should be ramped up to ensure preparedness for the next two months, the government has conveyed to eleven municipal areas in the country that have accounted for 70 per cent of India’s coronavirus case load.
Eleven municipal areas from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan account for 70 per cent of the active caseload, the Union health ministry said in a statement.
The government has directed these areas to step up monitoring in old cities, urban slums and other high density pockets like camps and clusters for migrant workers.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led government has directed state-run liquor shops in the national capital to ensure 100 per cent sale of alcohol through proper scanning, PTI reported. This came after the excise department learnt that only 10 to 15 per cent of liquor being sold at vends was being scanned, which was a blatant violation of the order.
In the direction to the four state-run corporations, the department said this practice is likely to result in the submission of “inaccurate daily sales” information sought by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia after imposition of 70 per cent ‘Special Corona Fee’ on the MRP of each bottle and also creation of Monthly Stock Record gap. Complaints of overcharging from the customers are being received at various levels, it added.
