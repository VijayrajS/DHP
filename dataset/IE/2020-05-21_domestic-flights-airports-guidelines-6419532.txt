Airports key travel guidelines: Aarogya Setu app, baggage drop, transport
The Airports Authority of India (AAI) Thursday issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for airport operators for recommencement of domestic flight operations, a day after the Centre said it will reopen the airspace from May 25. Among the key guidelines include mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app for those above 14 years, sanitation of baggage by airport operators before entering the airport, restrictions on vehicles allowed to pickup and drop off passengers.
The set of fresh guidelines come after the government announced its move to resume domestic passenger flight operations that have been suspended during the 54-day lockdown period.
All scheduled commercial passenger flights were suspended in India since March 25, when the Central government imposed lockdown to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special flights were allowed to operate after approval by the aviation regulator DGCA.
The AAI manages more than 100 airports across the country. However, major airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad are managed by private companies.
Meanwhile, aviation stocks on Thursday rallied up to 10 per cent in opening trade after the government announced that domestic passenger flight services will resume from May 25 in a calibrated manner.
InterGlobe Aviation shares zoomed 9.88 per cent to Rs 1,002 on the BSE. SpiceJet also jumped 4.88 per cent to Rs 42.95 â€” its upper circuit limit.
