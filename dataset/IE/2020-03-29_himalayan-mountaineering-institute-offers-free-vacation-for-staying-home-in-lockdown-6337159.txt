It is our humble initiative that through this event we would encourage people to stay home during this period as well as give them an opportunity to do something. One can share his or her home videos on our Facebook page. One can put up Yoga, physical fitness videos or anything that they are engaged with. They can also write essays and articles and share with us,‚Äù Group Captain Jai Kishan, Principal, HMI.
The videos and pictures have to be uploaded everyday single day during the lockdown starting from March 28 to April 14 on the Facebook page of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling along with details of the person and contact details.
‚ÄúThe person who uploads the best video or picture will get an opportunity to stay 5 nights and 4 days at the HMI, Darjeeling. The second prize will be 3 nights and 2 days at the HMI. The person adjudged third will wing an HMI tracksuit. All participants will be given certificates from HMI,‚Äù added Group Captain Jai Kishan.

Participants can also write articles on 21 Days Lockdown and email them to hmidarj@gmail.com. The best article will be published in the annual journal of the institute and the writer will receive free HMI journals for 5 years absolutely free.
The 336 Basic Mountaineering along with the 2nd Search & Rescue Courses of HMI had commenced earlier and was supposed to come to an end on March 31. However, due to the lockdown, the HMI has decided to keep the students at the hostels
‚ÄúRelatives of students are also encouraged to share their videos which our students can see. Our students too will put up pictures and videos. During their stay here, we have designed various outdoor and indoor competitions for these trainees. The competitions will be held adhering to hygiene and keeping a distance from each other. Students are in isolation and proper distance is maintained while doing or going for morning exercises. We want them to be occupied but stay safe‚Äù added the Principal.
