According to Punjab Pollution Control board, Punjab’s average AQI from March 22 to April 23 (34 days) was 47.82, which is considered “good” and puts state in the “green zone”.

One of the most polluted cities of India, Ludhiana, remained the cleanest city in the country with lowest AQI levels on many lockdown days. The AQI level of Ludhiana was 36 on March 23, while on March 25 it was 27.
AQI of all the cities of Punjab remained below 100 throughout the lockdown period. The minimum AQI of Punjab during the 34 days of curfew was on March 28 which was 30.66, while the maximum was on April 15 at 77.
Punjab’s average AQI on March 21 — a day before Janta Curfew — was 107.50, while it reduced to 74.50 on March 22, the day Janta Curfew was observed. It further fell to 51.33 on March 23 and then to 34.83 on March 25.
