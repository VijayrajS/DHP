West Bengal Mamata Banerjee has announced a slew of relaxations, including reopening of shrines from June 1 and restarting of private and public sector offices with full attendance from June 8. “I have come to know that the Railways is sending trains, jam-packed, with migrant labourers. In one seat, three-four persons are travelling for 48 hours, 72 hours. “So I thought then what is the harm in opening up religious places. From June 1, religious sites and places can open up in Bengal. But there would no major congregation or celebration of any festival,” Banerjee said.
The CM has, however, has said there will be no congregation and not more than 10 people would be allowed at a time at the religious places in the state. Banerjee also announced full operationalisation of the tea and jute industry, the states economic backbone.
Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij suggested that the lockdown should continue beyond May 31 and justified the strictness at the Delhi borders, saying free movement will lead to a surge in coronavirus cases in the state. Coronavirus cases in Haryana are reported over 1,500, including 9 deaths.
“If you ask my personal opinion, strictness will have to be maintained. Giving more relaxations at this stage can lead to increase in cases. Because the stage at which coronavirus is right now, need of the hour is that lockdown should be extended,” he said. Citing rise in cases in the national capital, Vij said the major reason for surging cases is movement of people from Delhi into these adjoining districts of Haryana. “70-80 per cent of the cases (in Haryana) are from districts adjoining the national capital,” he said.
At least 2,211 police personnel in Maharashtra have tested coronavirus positive so far, of whom 25 have lost their lives due to the infection, an official told PTI. As many as 249 of these COVID-19 patients are police officers, while 1,962 others are constabulary-rank personnel, he said, adding that they are undergoing treatment at various hospitals.
Of the total deceased, 16 officers were from Mumbai. Three others are from Nashik rural, two from Pune and one each from Solapur city, Solapur rural, Thane and the Mumbai ATS, the official said. “At least 116 personnel were found infected in the last 24 hours. The number of over a hundred police personnel testing coronavirus positive everyday has remained constant throughout this week,” he said.
As the fourth phase of the nationwide coronavirus lockdown nears its end, Home Minister Amit Shah met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and informed him about the views of all chief ministers on the road ahead. The Centre is expected to announce its decision on the lockdown within the next two days even as the number of Covid-19 cases in India climbed to 1,65,799 on Friday, making it the world’s ninth worst-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic. The death toll stood at 4,706.
During the meeting with the Home Minister, several states suggested further opening of the economy and social life. Karnataka has already written to the Centre for opening of malls and multiplexes from June 1 while Goa is planning to open restaurants beginning Monday. Many states are also nudging the Centre on relaxations for holding religious events as multiple festivals are scheduled in June and July. (Read more)

BSP president Mayawati on Friday asked the Centre and state governments to solve basic problems of livelihood and food faced by migrants returning home and said providing them jobs near their homes will be the real test of their intention. Referring to the Supreme Court’s directions that no fare for travel either by train or bus be charged from migrant workers stranded across the country, Mayawati said the government has been ignoring a similar demand made by the BSP.
In a series of tweets, she said, “Finally, for lakhs of migrant labourers returning home, suffering from all kinds of neglect/disdain due to the lockdown for the last 66 days in the country, the court had to say that it is the responsibility of the government to send them home by rail/bus free of cost. The government had been ignoring this demand of the BSP.”
# Less than 5% of all patients require critical care: As returning migrants and easing lockdown push the coronavirus far and wide, an analysis of statewise data shows that when it comes to Covid patients requiring critical care, their share, even in high-burden states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, remains low. So is the demand for ventilators. Similar is the case in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha where the migrant influx is pushing up Covid numbers.Of the total 83,004 active cases on May 27, less than 3500 needed any kind of intervention — oxygen therapy, ICU or ventilators.
# Most Shramik trains: Gujarat, Maharashtra to UP and Bihar:  Around 40 per cent of the Shramik Special trains so far have set off from the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, carrying roughly 20 lakh migrants back home. Until Thursday, 50 lakh stranded passengers had used these trains, the majority to get to their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, according to official data.
# Package not much help, govt must do the heavy lifting: As companies gradually ramp up capacities post the lockdown and announcement of the Rs 20 lakh crore AtmaNirbhar Covid economic package, many are of the view that the government needs to do a lot more heavy lifting to generate demand given the extraordinary circumstances. There cannot be a better way than increased government spending, direct cash transfers to consumers and deferment of taxes, according to responses of 100-plus companies to a survey carried out by a national trade body.
