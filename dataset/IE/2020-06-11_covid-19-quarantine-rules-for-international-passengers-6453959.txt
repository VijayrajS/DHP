Vande Bharat Mission phase 3: Statewise quarantine rules for international passengers
Vande Bharat Mission phase 3: The third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, India’s mammoth repatriation exercise, has begun amid confusion over different quarantine rules for the incoming international passengers in various states. While the passengers remained perplexed regarding booking of connecting flights and quarantine rules, the Consulate General of India, New York, shared some FAQs related to passenger queries.
People intending to book flights to India from June 11 onwards must register themselves with the Consulate. For passengers who could not get a direct flight to their destination states, they can take the flight to Delhi. However, passengers will have to undergo quarantine as per policy at Delhi before they are allowed to proceed to their home states. Under no circumstances, international passengers will be allowed to mix with domestic passengers before completing mandatory quarantine.
Also, passengers cannot take connecting flight to their own states on arrival. They can only proceed after completing the mandatory quarantine period at the airport of arrival. They, however, can board a connecting flight on arrival if it is a feeder flight.
The passengers will have to provide an undertaking at the time of booking and also at the airport prior to boarding. The undertaking and the quarantine regulations can be accessed at http://www.airindia.in. Check the list of flights under Vande Bharat Mission here

Besides, passengers will also have to take into account the different rules related to quarantine and entry passes into various states.
Here are the guidelines different states have issued for international passengers:
International passengers will have to undergo mandatory Covid-19 testing and seven days of institutional quarantine. While the government’s quarantine facility is free of cost, quarantine facilities at designated hotels are paid. Following this, asymptomatic passengers will be permitted to go for 7 day home quarantine with an advice for self-monitoring. Passengers also need to download Aarogya Setu app on arrival.
Passengers need to enrol on spandana.ap.gov.in before buying the ticket. Symptomatic persons will go to institutional quarantine where they shall be tested on arrival. They will be tested again after 7 days and if found negative, they will be released for home quarantine of another 7 days.
Those travelling to the state will have to register at Karnataka government’s Seva Sindhu portal at sevasindhu.karnataka.gov.in. The passengers need to fill the ‘Covid-19: Travel to Karnataka from other country’ form where they will be asked if they were quarantined by authorities in the recent past and the duration. This may come to aid for people taking connecting flights to the state.
