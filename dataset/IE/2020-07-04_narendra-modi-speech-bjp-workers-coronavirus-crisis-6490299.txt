Public expects us to deliver, PM Modi reminds BJP workers
For the BJP, the party organisation is not just a machine to win elections but “it means serving the people, taking everyone along, and ensuring everybody’s happiness and prosperity”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday.
Addressing party workers from across the country on a virtual platform, Modi lauded the leaders and workers for welfare works done during the lockdown period and the pandemic, but reminded them that each one of them is in public life to serve.

“Whenever the public demands things of us, we must understand that it expects us to deliver. The Covid-19 period has helped us understand this feeling better. The society gave us a chance to serve,” he said.
Modi told party workers: “For us, our organisation is not just a machine to win elections. For us, our organisation means service. Our organisation means taking everyone along. For us, our organisation means happiness of all and prosperity for all.”
Modi watched presentation of workers from seven states — Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh — on their social and welfare activities during the lockdown period at a function to review the ‘Seva Hi Sangathan’ programme. He asked the workers to prepare a digital book on works they have done right from the mandal and district level to the state and national level. The digital books, recording all welfare and social activities as well as creative works from the respective areas, would be an inspiration to the future generation, he said.
It could be released on September 25 on the occasion of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s birth anniversary.
After reviewing of the state units’ social activities, Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted: “No organisation in the world would have done service work on such large scale. For this I congratulate National President @jpnadda and crores of workers of the BJP.”
At the function, attended by BJP president J P Nadda and party general secretaries such as Rajnath Singh and Shah, among others, Modi said: “At a time when everyone in the world is busy protecting themselves, you have given up your worries and dedicated yourself to the service of the poor and the needy. This is a great example of service.”
If this had taken place in any western country, Modi said, everyone would have heaped praises on these activities.
The Prime Minister said the BJP is following the same principles its founding fathers had envisaged for it. “We considered power as a medium of service. We never made power our medium of profit. Selfless service has been our resolve, and that has been our value,” he said.
Modi had special praise for Nadda, who, he said, has been providing food packets from his own home for the poor throughout the lockdown period.
He also pointed out that the BJP has turned the crisis period into an opportunity. “We will remember the pandemic as the transformation stage for BJP, digitally. Today, a lot of our workers have got better on digital platforms.” He reiterated a seven-point code for party workers — sevabhav (service), santulan (balance), saiyam (restraint), sakaratmak (constructive), samvedana (sensitivity) and samvaad (dialogue) — and pointed out that the BJP is represented by all sections of the society.
