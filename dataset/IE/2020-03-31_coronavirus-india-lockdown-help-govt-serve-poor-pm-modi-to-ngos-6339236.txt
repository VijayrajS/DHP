Help govt serve poor: PM Modi to NGOs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday called on social welfare organisations and NGOs to help the government during the lockdown by providing basic necessities to the underprivileged, supplying medical and protective gear, and assisting with awareness campaigns on social distancing.
Speaking with their representatives via video conferencing, the Prime Minister invoked Mahatma Gandhi to exhort the organisations to serve the poor and the downtrodden. “The entire nation is displaying immense resilience, grit and patience’’ in facing the challenge of COVID-19, Modi said.
He praised the dedication and commitment of the participating organisations towards serving humanity.
