Meanwhile, in a communication to chief secretaries of state governments and Union Territory administrations, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said some states and UTs were issuing orders allowing activities that have not been allowed as per the guidelines issued by the Home Ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
The situation is “especially serious” in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, the letter said.
The Ministry of Home Affairs shot a letter to the Kerala government over its decisions to allow opening of restaurants, bus travel in cities and opening of MSME industries in urban areas, saying it amounted to dilution of lockdown guidelines and also a Supreme Court observation.
However, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government said there was some “misunderstanding” due to which the Centre had objected to dilution of the lockdown protocol.
In non-hotspot areas, the state guidelines allow services of domestic helps, opening of barber shops (non-AC and without cosmetic and beauty therapies), dine-in restaurants (till 7 pm), and local workshops, repair shops for electrical/electronic gadgets and machines. None of these found any mention in national guidelines. In fact, dine-in restaurants and domestic helps are understood to be prohibited.
The MHA letter also said the government has also failed to abide by the regulations by allowing bus travel in towns, pillion rider on two-wheelers and two passengers in the back seat of a car.
Contrary to the Centre’s guidelines that all public transport, barring those engaged in carrying healthcare workers or essential services, would be prohibited, Kerala has banned only “inter-district and inter-state” public transport. This would mean plying of public transport within a district (not falling in the Red Zone of COVID containment) would be permitted.
The Karnataka Cabinet on Monday decided to continue the lockdown measures currently in force in the state till May 3 without any relaxation. However, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and the COVID-19 Task Force will meet

District officials have been asked to work out the modalities regarding opening of specified industries, banks and other units in 56 districts that have reported less than 10 coronavirus cases.

The Punjab government has ruled out any relaxation in the curfew till May 3 barring wheat procurement. Following a meeting between Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and senior officers, all exemptions given from April 20 to industries in rural areas, booksellers, dhabas, shopkeepers dealing in air-conditioners and those involved in sand and gravel mining and stone crushing have been withdrawn.
The state government had allowed booksellers, dhabas, shops selling air-conditioners, coolers, fans; and those dealing in sand and gravel mining and stone crushing to operate.

The Delhi Police issued an advisory to its personnel, instructing them not to allow “additional activities” till a further comprehensive assessment is done by the city government. Meanwhile, all Central government officers of the deputy secretary level and above joined office from Monday.
The Telangana government has extended the lockdown in the state till May 7. Stating that the night curfew and lockdown restrictions will be implemented very strictly, Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao warned people of all faiths not to hold religious gatherings or converge at religious places.
