The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed the lives of millions of children in South Asia at risk, according to a recent UNICEF report. Quoting a study conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the report warned that as many as 8,81,000 children– aged five and under– could die over the next twelve months. A bulk of these deaths are likely to occur in India and Pakistan, the report said.
The report — titled ‘Lives Upended: How COVID-19 threatens the futures of 600 million South Asian Children’ — states that children in these countries are more likely to succumb to established illnesses like measles and pneumonia as public health systems are placed in a precarious position amidst this global health crisis.
The UNICEF report predicts a substantial spike in the number of children living in abject poverty due to the social and economic repercussions of COVID-19 and suggests that the pandemic could push an additional 120 million children below the poverty line within the next six months.
