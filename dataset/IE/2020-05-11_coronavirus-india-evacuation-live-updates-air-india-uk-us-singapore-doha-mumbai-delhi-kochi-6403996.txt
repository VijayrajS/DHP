With New Delhi‚Äôs enhanced focus on the Indian Ocean region in the wake of an assertive and proactive China, the government has sent Indian Naval ship Kesari to Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles, carrying on board two medical assistance teams, consignments of Covid-related essential medicines and essential food items.
This is the first time that a single assistance mission is covering all island countries of the western Indian Ocean in one go ‚Äî except Sri Lanka, for which a second set of medicines have been airlifted. Sources said that while this exhibits the contiguity of the government‚Äôs Indian Ocean policy, it also implicitly conveys the inclusion of Madagascar and Comoros as part of the ‚ÄòIndian Ocean vision‚Äô.
The medical teams will be deployed in Mauritius and Comoros, helping their governments deal with the pandemic and, in the case of Comoros, with dengue fever also.¬†Read more
