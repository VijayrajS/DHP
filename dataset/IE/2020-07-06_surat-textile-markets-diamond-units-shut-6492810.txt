Surat: Textile markets to be shut for 7 days, diamond units till July 13
Diamond markets to be closed till July 13  and textile markets to be shut for 7 days if even one case found,  as per orders released by Municipal Commissioner B N Pani on Monday.
The decision was taken after a significant number of textile traders and diamond polishers tested positive. Since Unlock-1, over 250 textile traders and 600 diamond polishers have tested positive. The Limbayat zone officials had a few days ago sealed 10 textile trading shops from where positive cases were reported. Most cases among polishers were reported from Katargam zone and Varachha areas.
“We have found that no proper guidelines are followed in the textile and diamond markets and factories. Permission to resume operations will be given to these units if they follow the civic body’s Covid-19 guidelines and standard operating procedures,” Pani said.
Surat has been reporting 200 plus cases since June 29, and has overtaken Ahmedabad in its daily Covid-19 case count.
