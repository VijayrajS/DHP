Telangana, anticipating case spike, plans 30,000 beds
Telangana government, facing criticism from the high court for underwhelming Covid testing numbers, is readying up to 30,000 beds in a phased manner anticipating a spike.
The state government has identified 12 government general hospitals, 23 private hospitals, and 21 private medical colleges, apart from converting a sports village into Covid-19 hospital. The 12 government general hospitals have a combined capacity of 4,777 isolation beds, including 325 ICU beds and 275 ICU beds with ventilators. The 21 private medical colleges can provide up to 15,500 beds, including 1,100 ICU beds and 200 ventilators.
As the majority of Covid-19 cases since May 8 are from Hyderabad and surrounding areas, the government is focusing on scaling up treatment facilities in and around Hyderabad. Till May 26, there were 1,991 corona positive cases in the state, of which 650 are under treatment and 57 died. Health Department officials said that 24 of the 31 districts are free of coronavirus.
In Hyderabad, working on a war-footing, the Telangana State Medical Services Infrastructure Development Corporation converted a 14-storey building near Gachibowli stadium into a 1,500-bed Covid hospital, including 50 ICU beds with ventilators. The building was in disuse after hosting sportspersons participating in the World Military Games in 2007. â€œWe refurbished the entire building in 20 days. We outfitted each floor which has 36 rooms with beds, furnishings, bathrooms, oxygen supply lines, water supply and plumbing, and medical facilities. Facilities for about 400 doctors and 1,000 staff have also been set up,â€™â€™ an official of TSMSIDC said.
Post-corona, government intends to expand this facility into Telangana Institute of Medical Science and Research on the lines of AIIMS. â€œThis new Covid facility has been kept ready in case existing facilities are overwhelmed. As of now all the patients are being treated at Gandhi Hospital, Chest Hospital, and King Koti Hospital,â€™â€™ Telangana Health Minister Etela Rajender said.
The government has also directed 23 private super-specialty hospitals in Hyderabad to keep isolation wards ready but barred them from conducting tests. The 21 private medical colleges in the state have also been notified to provide 10,950 beds for treating coronavirus patients.
â€œAll the 21 colleges have consented to provide Covid-19 treatment. These colleges have 900 ICU beds and 216 ventilators,â€™â€™ said Dr Karunakar Reddy, Vice-Chancellor of Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences, to which these private medical colleges are affiliated.
Dr Reddy said the government has assured the private medical colleges of medicines and personal protection equipment and other medical supplies for corona wards.
