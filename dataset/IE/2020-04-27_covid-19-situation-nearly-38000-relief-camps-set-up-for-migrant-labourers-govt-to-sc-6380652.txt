Additionally, 26,225 food camps had been opened, giving food to nearly 1.34 crore people, and nearly 16.5 lakh workers had been given shelter and food by their respective employers, the government said.
To ensure that no further problem is faced by migrant workers and other poor sections, directions have been issued under the Disaster Management Act 2005 that all employers, be it in the industry or shops, and / or other commercial establishments shall pay wages to their workers at their workplaces on the due date without any deduction for the period of closure during the lockdown.
