Govt eases curbs on shops: what is open, and what is not
The Centre has issued an advisory allowing select shops to function within and outside municipal limits with effect Saturday. In a fresh addendum to its April 15 lockdown guidelines, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said all shops, except those in market complexes and malls, will be allowed to open in urban areas. This is defined by “neighbourhood shops, standalone shops and shops in residential complexes” in urban areas governed by municipalities.
In rural areas, all shops, except shopping malls, have been allowed to resume operations.
These rules do not apply to Covid-19 containment zones and hotspots.
The new order comes as big relief for traders as well as residents after a month of the nationwide lockdown, which is due to end on May 3.
However, the government left the decision independent to states to decide whether they want to continue with the restrictions. Delhi and Assam, for example, have said they will decide in two days whether to reopen shops.
In India, over 24,500 people have been infected and 775 deaths have been reported, so far. Follow coronavirus LIVE updates here
