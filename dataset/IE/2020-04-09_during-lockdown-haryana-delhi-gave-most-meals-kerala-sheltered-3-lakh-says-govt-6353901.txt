While Haryana and Delhi governments have provided two out of every three meals given to migrant workers and the needy by state government through food camps during the nationwide lockdown, and Kerala is among states have not given out any meals through food camps, the coastal state has provided shelter to nearly half the people given shelter across the country.
The details were shared by the Union government in a status report filed in Supreme Court.

The governmentâ€™s data shows that out of 54.15 lakh meals given to people by different state governments at food camps since the lockdown began, 34.7 lakh have been provided by two governments: 22.38 lakh meals by Haryana, and 12.32 lakh by Delhi.
Other states that have given more than 1 lakh meals each include Uttar Pradesh (6.84 lakh meals), Uttarakhand (2.65 lakh), Punjab (1.94 lakh), Jharkhand (1.22 lakh), and Karnataka (1.12 lakh).
As per the Centreâ€™s state-wise data on shelter and food camp being run by state governments and NGOs, submitted to the apex court on Tuesday, the governments of Kerala, Telangana and Sikkim, and the UT administration of Ladakh have not provided any meal through food camps.
Kerala, however, has provided shelter to more than 3 lakh people, nearly half of 6.31 lakh people provided shelter by state governments across the country. The UP government has given shelter to over 1 lakh people in need, according to statistics.

Approval granted to NGOs to provide help
