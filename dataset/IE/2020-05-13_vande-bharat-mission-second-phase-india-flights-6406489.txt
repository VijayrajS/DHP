Flights to destinations from the first phase such as UAE, USA, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bangladesh will continue.
The rules for bringing Indians back were spelt out in the first phase itself. However, sources said that there could be some modifications in the second phase.
Those who want to leave the country will also have to fulfill a specific criterion. Outbound-travellers also have to fulfil conditions imposed by destination countries.
According to sources, there may be some changes in rules for outbound travellers also.
There are about 1.4 crore Indians overseas, at present. So far, about 3 lakh Indians have registered from the Gulf region alone, but sources said Indian embassies will ascertain those who have ‚Äúcompelling reasons‚Äù to return.
