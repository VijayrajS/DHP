As of now, West Bengal has reported 716 Covid-19 cases, including 18 deaths.
On Saturday, the two Inter-ministerial Central Teams (IMCT) wrote three more letters to West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, alleging a lack of cooperation and withholding information related to coronavirus. The Centre had sent the teams to review the state’s handling of the pandemic in Kolkata and its neighbouring areas, and north Bengal.
While two letters were written by Apurba Chandra, who heads the Kolkata team, another came from the north Bengal team. They reiterated their allegation that lockdown was not strictly followed in some parts.
“The IMCT has been in Kolkata since 10am on 20.04.2020. Four letters have been written by the IMCT to the state government till today. No response has been received to any of the letters. A hard copy of the presentation which was made on 23.04.2020 has also not been made available,” read one of the letters.
