24 fresh coronavirus cases in Valley, contacts of those who earlier tested positive
Eleven family members of a man from Hajin in Bandipora district, who died this week and tested positive for coronavirus, were among 24 fresh cases reported in the Valley on Thursday, officials said. Jammu and Kashmir now has 184 cases, of which 152 are from Kashmir.
Health officials said half of the cases reported Thursday were from Bandipora district alone. Kashmir has recorded 54 new cases in the last 48 hours.
J&K government spokesperson Rohit Kansal said the 24 cases were contacts of those who had earlier tested positive. He tweeted, “24 more positive in Kashmir. Total 184. 32 in Jammu, 152 in Kashmir. All are contacts. A result of aggressive testing.”
Earlier this week, a 54-year-old diabetes patient from Hajin had died in a Srinagar hospital and was subsequently found positive for COVID-19.
A senior health official said, “11 family members of a person who died this week have tested positive today. They were already under quarantine when the man died because they were in close contact with him… They have been put under isolation.”
