It‚Äôs common knowledge that this decision is part of a series of retaliatory steps against China in the middle of a tense border standoff at Ladakh, but the government said the apps were ‚Äústealing and surreptitiously transmitting users‚Äô data‚Äù to servers outside India. The most popular among the banned apps is TikTok, which has eight offices in India and 1,000 employees.¬†

Meanwhile, security forces have been equally committed in fighting militancy ‚Äî 41 militants killed in the month of June itself.
Corps Commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies will be meeting today for the third time as part of efforts to de-escalate the situation on the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.
