Coronavirus: Eight more test positive in Chhattisgarh
Days after a 16-year-old boy in Katghora town in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district tested positive for the coronavirus, eight more people from the area tested positive.
The state government has sealed the area and is going to test all the residents of the area, sources said.
“All the eight patients lived in a community… These people interacted with the boy who was tested earlier…” said a senior police officer from Korba.
Bilaspur range IG Dipanshu Kabra said, “The people found positive today are residents of Chhattisgarh who came in contact with some people who had come from Kamptee. We have already registered an FIR against the people from Kamptee as they had hidden their travel histories.”
Neighbouring district Sarguja has also shut the inter-district border to ensure containment.
With the new cases, the state’s tally for coronavirus patients has reached 18, of whom nine have been discharged. All the nine active patients are currently admitted in AIIMS Raipur.
