A senior police officer said that during the night checking and patrolling on MB road, they found a truck around 1:30 am. “It was a routine check but since the truck had a Haryana registration number, we stopped it near Okhla T-point. We found 37 men inside the truck,” said the police. The police shifted all of them to a shelter home.
