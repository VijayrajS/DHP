We have written to the chief secretary (Delhi) to start four trains from Delhi every day. He has agreed, and from tomorrow (Friday), four trains from Delhi will come to UP every day. Along with this, trains for migrants stranded in Ghaziabad and Noida will also be started for (other parts of) UP and for Bihar as well. We have spoke to chief secretary, Bihar as well. This is good news for those workers who are in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida. These trains will start from tomorrow. From Saharanpur, three trains will be started every day for Bihar for people who had come from Haryana to Saharanpur.”
