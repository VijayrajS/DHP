14-day mandatory quarantine: Guidelines for international arrivals
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on Sunday made it mandatory for stranded Indians arriving from abroad to check into an institutional quarantine for 7 days at their own expense followed by seven days of home isolation.
Specifying guidelines for the international arrivals, the ministry said that before boarding, all the travellers would have to give an undertaking that they would stick to the above rule to ensure least chances of transmission.
Exceptions will be given in a few cases — human distress, pregnancy, death in family, serious illness and parents accompanied by children below 10 years of age. They will be asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
All passengers arriving would also be advised to download Aarogya Setu app on their mobile devices. At the time of boarding the flight or ship, all the asymptomatic travellers would be allowed to board after thermal screening. A list of dos and don’ts would also be provided along with the ticket by the agencies they were travelling with.
On Saturday, Union Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the ministry will try to start some percentage of international passenger flights well before August this year. “We will try to start a good percentage of international passenger flights before August,” he said. However, evacuation of Indians in foreign countries would go on under Vande Bharat Mission. Home Ministry recently also permitted a section of Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) to travel back to India.
With India resuming its domestic flight operations from Monday and its passenger train operations from June 1 after a gap of two months due to coronavirus lockdown, MoHFW also issued guidelines for domestic travel (air/train/inter-state bus travel).
