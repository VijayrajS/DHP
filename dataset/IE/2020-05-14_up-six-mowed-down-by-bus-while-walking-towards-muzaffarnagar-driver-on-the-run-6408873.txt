Six migrant workers mowed down by UP transport bus while walking towards Muzaffarnagar
A father-son duo were among six people who were killed when a group of migrant workers, who were walking from Haryana to their villages in Bihar, were allegedly hit by a speeding UPSRTC bus on the Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur state highway in Muzaffarnagar district.
Four others were injured in the accident late on Wednesday. Two of them were taken to Meerut for treatment.
“We were told by local residents that these people were migrants who were walking. Six people were declared brought dead after being rushed to the hospital. The accused driver, Rajveer, was drinking and driving and has been arrested for death due to negligence,” said Anil Kaparvan, SHO of Kotwali police station in Muzaffarnagar.
The accused hails from Firozabad district.
The deceased have been identified as Harek Singh (51), his son Vikas (22), Guddu (18), Vasudev (22), Harish Sahni (48) and Virendra (28).
Virendra was from Patna and Guddu was from Bhojpur while the rest were from Gopalganj district.
The bus, registered at UPSRTC Mathura depot, had earlier travelled from Agra to Saharanpur after dropping off a group of migrants stranded in another district, police said. The empty bus was due to make a journey back home when it allegedly ran over the group near Ghalauli checkpost around 10.30 pm.
According to survivors, the migrants had set out from Kharera in Haryana on Sunday and taken rest at an ashram in Saharanpur a day before the accident. They had covered a few kilometres on Wednesday when the incident took place.
Taking cognizance of the incident, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 each to those of the injured. He also ordered the Saharanpur authorities to probe the matter and arrange for the bodies to be taken to their respective homes.
