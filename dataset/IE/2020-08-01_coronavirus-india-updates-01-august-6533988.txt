The second round of sero-prevalence survey began in Delhi on Saturday, with the five-day exercise set to cover various demographic segments and all districts, news agency PTI reported. The exercise is being done as a part of a comprehensive assessment of the coronavirus situation in the national capital.
A senior government official told PTI 15,000 samples would be collected from August 1 to 5 as part of the exercise, spanning different areas and age groups. Representative samples will be taken from all 11 districts.
A sero-prevalence survey involves testing the blood serum to check for the prevalence of antibodies.
The last sero-prevalence survey was conducted by the Delhi government from June 27 to July 10. It found that around 23 per cent of the people surveyed had been exposed to the novel coronavirus. The survey had tested 21,387 samples.
The Delhi government had decided to conduct more monthly sero surveys to find out the percentage of people who were infected by the virus and had recovered in order to formulate better policies for tacking the disease, Health Minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said.
The high-level Group of Ministers (GOM) on COVID-19 has agreed to the health ministry’s proposal to allow the export of indigenously made ventilators.
The decision was taken as India continues to maintain a progressively declining low rate of fatality among COVID-19 patients, which currently stands at 2.15 per cent, “which means fewer numbers of active cases are on ventilators”, the Union health ministry said in a statement.
As on July 31, only 0.22 per cent of the active cases were on ventilators across the country, it stated. The health ministry said the GoM’s decision has been communicated to the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) for further action needed to facilitate the export of indigenously manufactured ventilators.
“Now with the export of ventilators having been allowed, it is hoped that domestic ventilators would be in a position to find new markets in foreign countries,” it said, adding that there has been substantial growth in the domestic manufacturing capacity of ventilators. Compared to January, there are more than 20 domestic manufacturers of ventilators.
Union Minister of State from Home G Kishan Reddy Saturday said asked states to emulate the “Delhi model” for controlling the spread of coronavirus.
Reddy visited Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS), a building at a sports complex in Gachibowli, Hyderabad, which was transformed into a hospital.
A senior official Saturday said the coronavirus-induced lockdown in the containment zones of Maharashtra’s Thane district has been extended till August 31.
