Here are the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic from across the country today:
In its daily presser, the Union Health Ministry underlined that the recovery rate of India remains 19 per cent and that no new cases have been reported in 12 districts in the last 28 days. It also said no new cases have been reported in 78 districts in last 14 days.

The government said the increase in COVID-19 cases in India has been more or less linear not exponential. In the last month, number of dedicated COVID-19 hospitals rose by 3.5 times while isolation beds increased by 3.6 times.
Meanwhile, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said stigma over COVID-19 is resulting in increase in mortality and morbidity as patients are opting for treatment only when symptoms have worsened. Stating that it is important to the reach out to patients who are missing out on treatment because of the stigma and panic, Dr Guleria urged all to see patients as symbols of hope and victory.
Due to Covid-19, the government has decided to freeze the dearness allowance to central government employees and dearness relief to pensioners at current rates till July 2021. However, DA and DR at current rates will continue to be paid. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance states: “As and when the decision to release the future installment of DA and DR due from July 1, 2021 is taken by the Government, the rates of DA and DR as effective from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will be restored prospectively and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rate effected from July 1, 2021.”
The government is likely to save Rs. 37,530 crore in the Financial Year 2020-21 and 2021-22 on account of this decision, sources told The Indian Express. As state governments normally follow the Centre’s orders on DA/DR, it is estimated that states could save Rs. 82,566 crore by implementing similar orders. Thus, the total anticipated saving of the Centre and states will be Rs. 1.20 lakh crore, which will be used to fight the Covid-19 battle and its fallout.

Addressing the Congress Working Committee — the highest decision-making body of the Congress party — via video conference, Gandhi said the party’s suggestions offered to the government to fight Covid-19 had been acted upon “only partially” and “in a miserly way”.
Since the last CWC meeting three weeks ago, Gandhi said the pandemic had “increased disturbingly” in spread and speed. “Since the lockdown commenced on March 23, I have, as you all know, written several times to the Prime Minister. I offered our constructive cooperation and also made a number of suggestions to alleviate the suffering of both rural and urban families. These suggestions had been formulated on the basis of feedback we have been receiving from different sources, including our Chief Ministers.
“Unfortunately, they have been acted upon only partially and in a miserly way. The compassion, large-heartedness and alacrity that should be forthcoming from the Central Government is conspicuous by its absence,” she said.
