Yogi Adityanath: Won’t be able to perform last rites of my father due to lockdown
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s father Anand Singh Bisht passed away on Monday morning while undergoing treatment at the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.
The chief minister said he would not be able to perform the last rites because of the lockdown.
Expressing his grief, the chief minister in a statement said, “He inculcated the habits of being honest, hard work and to work for the public welfare in me. I wanted to visit him in his last moments but couldn’t do so because I was involved in planning the fight against coronavirus. I will not be able to take part in the last rites because of the lockdown.” He also made a request to his mother and family members to complete the last rites with minimum possible people and said that he would visit once the lockdown is over.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said Bisht passed away at around 10.44 am.
