They have also been asked to make sufficient arrangements for masks, gloves, tissues, hand sanitizers, adequate food and drinking water and essential medicines. Students have been told to prepare for departure at “very short notice” on Friday afternoon.
In New Delhi, the government said that it was waiting for the necessary approval from the Chinese side for the two Air India flights to bring back about 600 Indians, who have been contacted by the Indian embassy.

We are awaiting the necessary approval from the Chinese side. We hope this will be granted soon.”
The government has reached out to over 600 Indians living in China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, to ascertain their willingness to be brought back to India.

According to Chinese authorities, the nationwide death toll from novel coronavirus has jumped to 170. Kumar said arrangements are being put in place for people to travel to the airport in Wuhan.
