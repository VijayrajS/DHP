The 9,851 new cases on Thursday came as the Centre released a set of guidelines for the reopening of malls, religious places, restaurants and hotels from June 8. The standard operating procedures (SOPs) are advisories for states and Union Territories, which have the authority to take the last call. These cannot be enforced in containment zones.
As more and more people are coming into the state from various parts of the country and abroad, Andhra Pradesh is witnessing a spurt in coronavirus cases as the total climbed to 4,250 on Friday with the addition of 138 in the last 24 hours.
Of the fresh cases, 84 came from other states and four from abroad, the latest health department bulletin said. Two more deaths were also reported in the state, taking the tally to 73 so far.
In the state, 4,23,564 coronavirus tests were conducted so far and the positivity rate turned out to be one per cent, the government said. Of the 4,250 positive cases, 700 were from other states and 123 foreign returnees.
In all, 2,556 patients recovered and got discharged, including 258 from other states and four foreign returnees, leaving 1,621 active cases.
Fourteen more people, all Chennai returnees, tested positive for COVID-19 in Nagaland, taking the state’s tally to 94, officials said on Friday. “Fourteen new positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 24 hours out of 235 samples tested. All the samples tested were from Chennai returnees,” Minister for Health and Family Welfare S Pangnyu Phom tweeted.
The patients, who belong to Peren district, were under quarantine in government facilities in Dimapur since their return to the state in a Shramik Special train on May 22, State Nodal Officer for Integrated Disease Surveillance Program, Nyan Kikon, said. All of them are under 30 years of age and asymptomatic at present, he said, adding, that they are being treated at a COVID-19 hospital in Dimapur.
Dimapur accounts for the highest number of coronavirus cases in Nagaland with 71 testing positive. No death or recovery has so far been reported in the state since the first COVID-19 case was detected on May 25, sources said. Nagaland has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases after the return of a large number of people from other states.
Amid surge in coronavirus cases, recovery rate of COVID-19 patients in the national capital has gradually fallen in the last 10 days, dipping to 39.58 per cent as reported on June 4, according to official figures. This is the first time in the past two weeks that the recovery rate has fallen below 40 per cent.
Barring June 1, when it saw a spike of 990 cases, Delhi has been recording over 1,000 fresh cases everyday from May 28-June 4, the highest being 1,513 on June 3. Delhi recorded 1,359 fresh coronavirus cases on Thursday, taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 25,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease mounted to 650, authorities said.
The Supreme Court Friday issued notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking an upper limit on Covid-19 treatment charges in private hospitals. The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and comprising Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, also sought the response of private hospitals which had been given land at concessional rates by the government, on providing treatment to patients for free.
“I just want to know if hospitals are ready to charge at Ayushman Bharat rates,” the CJI said, reported news agency PTI.
The apex court directed the Solicitor General to take instructions in a week’s time.
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has issued fresh guidelines for coronavirus patients, under which room charges have been capped at Rs 5,000 per day, ICU charges at Rs 10,000 per day and quarantine charges at Rs 3,000 per day, with a maximum sum insured of Rs 5 lakh.
Sources in the industry told The Indian Express while the existing health insurance policies cover Covid-19 treatment, the fresh guidelines and caps would be limited to Covid-specific products that will be issued over the next 10 days.
In the month of May, Mumbai tested between 4,000 and 4,2000 samples daily despite a steady rise in its number of cases. The city, which accounts for 20 per cent of India’s Covid-19 cases, has the capacity to test about 10,000 samples a day.
More surprising is the fact that Mumbai’s stagnant testing numbers are in contrast with the rest of the state as a whole, which saw a 100 per cent jump over the same period. This means Maharashtra was testing people outside Mumbai, even though the outbreak was not as severe in other cities and districts.
“Earlier, in March, around 70-75 per cent of tests in Maharashtra were happening in Mumbai. From May onward, we have noticed a consistent decline. That is worrying,” a state health official told The Indian Express.
In the week ending May 31, every fourth sample tested in the national capital was positive for Covid-19. The Indian Express reports the positivity for a total cumulative testing rate of 2,018 tests per million population was 25.7%.
The highest rates of positivity are in South East Delhi (38.8% at 506 tests per million) and North East Delhi (38.6% at 517 tests per million), followed by West Delhi (38% at 1,817 per million), North West Delhi (36.7% at 1,334 tests per million), and East Delhi (34% at 1,452 per million).
Researchers have predicted the number of Covid-19 cases in Chennai could increase to 1.5 lakh, with up to 1,600 deaths, by the second week of July at the current rate of growth. The projection, made by epidemiologists at the state-run Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University is based on mathematical calculations.
Dr G Srinivas, professor and head of the department of epidemiology at the university, said cases could touch 1.5 lakh by July 15 and peak in mid-October.
The Telangana government has allowed religious places of worship, hotels, restaurants, and other hospitality services, along with shopping malls, to resume operations from June 8. However, gaming centres and cinema halls in these malls will not be allowed to operate.
Schools, colleges, educational/training/coaching institutions will remain shut across the state. The list of prohibited activities/businesses or services includes Metro Rail, cinema halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, sports complexes, theaters, bars, auditoriums, and assembly halls, etc.
