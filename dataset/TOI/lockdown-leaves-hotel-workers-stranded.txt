MUSSOORIE: Staff members of several hotels in the town have been left stranded after hotels across the town were closed, as the state went into lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.


On Monday morning, a number of hotel workers, some with their families, were seen waiting at Tehri bus stand to catch buses to their villages, but with bus services and even local jeep transport closed, they were left stranded.

“The hotels have shut down, leaving us with no option but to return to our villages. However, there is no transport available for us to return,” said Amit Bhatt, a hotel staffer.

“I had been waiting for several hours but roadways bus service has been shut down and even local jeeps are not plying,” said Shishupal (name changed), who was working at a hotel in Dehradun and had reached Mussoorie to transit to his village.

According to R P Badoni, president, Mussoorie Hotel Workers’ Union, about 70% of hotel staff had left on Sunday, but those who were left in Mussoorie now faced difficulty due to shutdown of transport services.

“There are more than 100 workers who could not return to their villages. We spoke to hoteliers who agreed to let the staff stay in hotel premises till the time they can find safe transport to their villages,” Badoni said.
