321 cases in 7 days: Will more testing in Kerala do the trick?
2020-05-27
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has decided to amend its Covid-19 testing strategy in the wake of more cases being reported through contact and with unknown sources. A minimum of 3,000 samples will be tested a day. 


A review meeting chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday decided to increase the number of daily tests as the virus clusters are increasing among people with no travel history. The tests will be increased in areas where more cases were reported after May 7.

Vijayan said the testing would be extended to possible disease carrier categories. "The sentinel surveillance is being done only in priority groups now. The testing will be extended to people in regions where more cases have been reported," he said.

The health department has already augmented testing of samples in Kannur and Palakkad. The department has been conducting only below 1,500 tests a day till date. Only 56,704 samples were tested in the state so far since the first reported case on January 30, besides 8,599 samples collected from among priority groups.

As many as 32 persons were infected through contact since May 22, and the department is yet to trace the source of infection in at least 10 cases among these. After May 7, the number of cases without known source of infection is 29.

Experts have been pushing for more tests in the state to check the spread of the virus. They had also pointed out that the state was way behind the national average in testing.

"Home quarantine alone cannot bring down the number of cases or arrest spread. We have to test all symptomatic persons and we have to raise the number of testing centres for this. At present, there are only one or two testing centres in a district,‚Äù internal medicine expert Dr N M Arun said.
