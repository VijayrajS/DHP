PANAJI: The number of active Covid-19 cases in Goa now stands at one. Of the two patients, who were under treatment, one has been cured, health minister Vishwajit Rane said on Wednesday evening. The lone patient continues to be under treatment in Margao. “Goa to lead the way! Happy to announce that Goa’s active Covid-19 cases are down from 2 to 1, after following due protocol. As per the guideline, a repeat sample was tested and reported negative,” Rane said.

Congratulating the team of doctors and staff led by Dr Edwin Gomes for their wonderful job, the health minister exuded confidence that by next week Goa will have zero positive cases.
