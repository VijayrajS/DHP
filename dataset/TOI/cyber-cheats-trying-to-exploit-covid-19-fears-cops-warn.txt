Cyber cheats trying to exploit Covid-19 fears, cops warn
2020-03-27
City police have warned that cyber cheats are using phishing links under the garb of providing information about the novel coronavirus pandemic to trap unwary citizens and hack their phones or computers. DCP cybercell, Rajdeepsinh Jhala said numerous phishing links on Covid-19 have been detected on the internet. “If anyone clicks on such links received by messages or in other forms, his or her mobile or computer may be hacked. Once cheats can hack your mobile, it is easy for them to get your financial and personal details,” he said. Jhala said it is a serious issue and the cybercell is working to trace the cheats. On a postive note, Ahmedabad police tweeted that the city crime branch has taken a lead in #fight against Corona# by distributing wheat flour, bread and milk packets for the needy. tnn
