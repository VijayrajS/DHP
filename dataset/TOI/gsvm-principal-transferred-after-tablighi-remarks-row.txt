2020-06-12
Kanpur: Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial medical college principal Dr Arti Lalchandani was attached with the office of director general medical education on Thursday and Dr R B Kamal appointed the new principal. The government action came in wake of her alleged controversial remarks against members of Tablighi Jamaat after a video went viral recently.

District magistrate Dr Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari told TOI said an order of Dr Lalchandani’s attachment to DGME’s office was received on Thursday and she was apprised about the same.

There had been an outcry after the video of Dr Lalchandani surfaced on social media on May 31 wherein she purportedly referred to Tablighi Jamaat members as terrorists and questioned why the government was giving them VIP treatment instead of punishing them by keeping them in solitary confinement in jails.
