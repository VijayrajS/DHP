Aala Hazrat Trust demands ban on Tablighi Jamaat
2020-04-01
Bareilly: In a letter addressed to the offices of the Prime Minister, Union ministers for home and external affairs, as well as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, NGO Aala Hazrat Trust on Tuesday demanded immediate ban on Tablighi Jamaat for continuing with its Markaz congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi after the state ordered a lockdown. It also demanded legal action against the Markaz organisers.

Aala Hazrat Trust president Mohtashim Raza Khan said, “The irresponsible organisers of the Tablighi Jamaat held their conference with neither security nor healthcare professionals, even as WHO declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic. Thus they critically endangered our country and people. Many of the attendees were unwell, but didn’t inform the government and endangered us all. We condemn their irresponsible behavior, demand that the central government should ban the organisation and take strict action against its organizers. They have broken a fundamental rule of Islam, which says we are responsible for every single life in this universe.”
