MEERUT: Three persons from Meerut, including a woman staffer of a Delhi hotel who had served meal to a guest who later tested positive, showed symptoms of coronavirus. The other two include man, who recently returned from China and was declared safe after the mandatory quarantine, and his sister.


The samples of the three suspected cases have been taken and sent to Lucknow for tests.

“We have sent the samples of all the three suspected patients to Lucknow and we are supposed to get the reports by late Friday night. The patients have been quarantined at their respective homes in Modipuram and Civil Lines. However, if they test positive for coronavirus, they will be quarantined accordingly in separate isolation wards,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

Meanwhile, a 24x7 team has been put into place at a Meerut hospital for coronavirus-related cases. A 20-bed isolation ward has been set up while another 10-bed isolation ward has also been set up in a district hospital here.

“The local residents should not panic and take care of their hygiene by washing their hands frequently with soap and water. However, in cases where water and soap are not readily available, alcohol-based hand sanitisers should be used to maintain cleanliness. Also, one should avoid travel in public transport unless very necessary,” the CMO said.
