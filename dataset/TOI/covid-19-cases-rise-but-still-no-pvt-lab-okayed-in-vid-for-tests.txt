2020-04-27
Nagpur: Even after 230-plus Covid-19 cases have been detected in the region, testing in private labs is still not allowed in Vidarbha.Total 19 private laboratories in Maharashtra are allowed to conduct the Covid-19 tests and all of them are in Pune and Mumbai. Even franchisees of Mumbai-Pune based labs in Vidarbha are not allowed to collect samples directly. Due to this, many people in Vidarbha who are ready to pay for the Covid-19 tests cannot get themselves screened.“If the patient is hospitalized in private hospital for non-Covid illness, but treating doctors suspect the patient is showing coronavirus symptoms, they may refer such cases for tests. We are allowed to collect samples of such patients only,” said Vikrant Pawar, regional manager of Metropolis Health Services India Ltd. Metropolis has collection centres in Nagpur, but tests are conducted in Mumbai. “Many residents approach us and ask whether they can get themselves tested, but we are helpless. As per rules, we can collect samples of only hospitalized patients,” Pawar added. Due to this, hundreds of asymptomatic carriers are not getting tested. Metropolis lab has written to district health officer proposing to conduct 5,000 tests of BPL patients for free and charge only government price of Rs4,500 from other patients in case they are given permission in Nagpur. Collection centres have to deport swab samples to Mumbai by freight trains. Result takes 48 hours. If the result comes positive, authorities immediately shift the patient from private hospital to government Covid-19 facility. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) vacates and sanitizes entire hospital where patient was admitted. Due to this threat, many private hospitals don’t refer patients for Covid-19 test. Chances are that a considerable number of patients must be getting unreported due to this. Clinicare Speciality Lab in Jasleen Hospital in Dhantoli also has permission to collect swab samples, but they are also facing same issues. “I request people not to visit Jasleen Hospital because we can’t collect your swab samples here. We are allowed to collect samples of patients referred by doctors only. We also need Aadhaar card and other documents of the patient,” said Dr Rajkumar Rathi, director of this lab.Health department officials claimed there are many government labs available in the region and people eager to get themselves tested can visit there. “At this point of time, we are following ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines for tests. Apart from close and high risk contacts of existing positive patients, we are testing only those who have pneumonia, respiratory and lung disorders. Anyone having mere cough and cold cannot be tested. We have limited resources,” said a senior official.In Mumbai and Pune, private labs are allowed to conduct tests of all those who approach them with doctor’s prescription. Swabs can be collected from their homes too. There is no need for people to wait in hospital or lab until result arrives. Due to this, many asymptomatic carriers have been traced in these cities.
