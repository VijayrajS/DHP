COIMBATORE: Members of Students Federation of India (SFI) on Thursday held protests across the district demanding that the Class X exam be held only after the Covid-19 pandemic is brought under control.

The state government had announced that the exam will be held from June 1 to June 12.

As the state is still dealing with the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions have not yet been fully lifted, holding the exam will be very unfavourable for the students, SFI district representative Dhinesh Raja said. “The chief minister said that transport service should not resume till May 31. How can students who have gone to their hometowns return for appearing for the exam? Also, if they get passes and return to the city, they will be quarantined as per the district administration’s norms. So, how can students who have gone to other districts come back and prepare for the exam?”

Even when transport facilities were available, students from rural areas and tribal hamlets couldn’t get buses on time, Raja said. “We had heard of such incidents from Siruvani and the Nilgiris. As they could not catch buses, some students arrived late at the exam centres.”

Schools used for Covid-19 related relief work have to be sanitised properly before students are made to write exams there, the members said.
