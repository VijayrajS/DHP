PHAGWARA: A 65-year-old woman who had been unwell for the last few days poisoned herself in Khurampur village on Sunday morning. Police suspect that the fear of Covid-19 pushed her to take the extreme step.

Station house officer (SHO), Phagwara Sadar police station Amarjit Singh said the deceased, Santosh Kaur had been suffering from cough and fever for the last few days and she visited the civil hospital. 

“Doctors gave her medication and told her that the fever had nothing to do with Covid-19. Neither did she have travel history nor had she received any guest from abroad. She had been living alone as her four daughters were married and her husband had died. Apparently she was depressed,” he said.

The SHO said they spoke to her daughters and other village residents and could identify no other triggers. Her last rites were performed in the village.
