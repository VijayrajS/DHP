NAGPUR: A 28-year-old woman from Mominpura gave birth to a baby girl a few hours after testing positive for Covid-19 at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) on Wednesday. She is the first corona positive patient to deliver a baby in Vidarbha.


Head of obstetrics and gynaecology department of IGGMCH Dr Prashant Uikey told TOI, “Both mother and her girl are doing well. The woman was in labour pain when she reported to IGGMCH on April 28. Being from Mominpura, which is one of the two hotspots of Covid-19, we collected her swab samples and sent them for tests as per protocol. Her reports came back positive. The delivery was conducted in the morning on April 29. The baby girl is the first child of this woman,” Dr Uikey said.

The delivery was normal and all parameters of the baby too are reportedly normal. Her weight is 2kg. After testing positive for Covid-19, the mother and child were shifted to a separate cubicle in the Covid-19 isolation ward. The baby is still with her mother but at a safe distance.

Doctors said, “We are monitoring vital health parameters of both mother and baby in regular manner. As breastfeeding is safe and does not infect the baby, we are allowing the mother to breastfeed.”

Samples of the baby for Covid-19 were collected and reports are likely to come on Thursday.

But the case has increased the worries of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), as it is the third new case from Mominpura. She is reportedly a resident of Ansar Nagar in Mominpura, and not from the existing corona chains.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe said, “NMC organized a special camp to collect swab samples as part of antenatal care for three days from April 26 to 28 in Mominpura and Satranjipura. The initiative was to ensure good health of expecting mothers and their babies. Despite requests time and again, only around 150 of 251 expectant mothers gave samples. We are taking nine steps and expecting only one step from people, which is cooperation. Still, we are not getting correct information and necessary help from people,” he said.

One of the earlier 26 positive cases from Mominpura is from Ansar Nagar, but it is a MP-based Tablighi Jamaati, who was camping at city’s Markaz ‘Lal Building’. Some 23 are from Takia Deewanshah and form one chain of transmission. One person tested positive from Timki and a woman (TB) patient from a locality adjacent to Takia Deewanshah.

With the latest woman, the number of cases from Mominpura in Central Nagpur increased to 27.

Two more persons — 27-year-old man and 33-year-old woman — from Satranjipura also tested positive on Wednesday. The two were under institutional quarantine. The number of positive cases from this locality has increased to 86.

With the latest three, total number of positive cases from the district is 136, of which 63.23% are from Satranjipura and 18.85% from Mominpura. Two have died, 42 have been discharged and remaining are undergoing treatment.

Also, on Wednesday, reports of a 27-year-old man came positive from Nagpur Veterinary College of Mafsu. This is the first positive came from this VRDL.

NMC has again started to quarantine people from Satranjipura, with 402 shifted on Wednesday night. Total number of quarantined from this area has thus increased to 1,408.
