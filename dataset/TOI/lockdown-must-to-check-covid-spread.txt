Uttar Pradesh: ‘Lockdown must to check Covid-19 spread’
2020-04-29
LUCKNOW: With the Covid-19 cases spiking up in the state, the UP government may not recommend to Prime Minister Narendra Modi the complete lifting of the lockdown even after May 3.


This was the general mood of senior ministers who were called by chief minister Yogi Adityanath at his official residence on Tuesday evening.

Apart from the deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, ministers Suresh Khanna and Srikant Sharma were also present at the meeting. MSME minister Siddharth Nath Singh could not attend the meeting as he was pre-opccupied with a webinar with US industrialists at Lok Bhawan on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, the CM would meet ministers of state and those having independent charges to seek their views on the lockdown. The CM is holding a two-day mood-gauging exercise with his ministers before sending a final report to the PMO in this connection.

At Tuesday's meeting, the deputy CMs and the senior ministers told the CM that lifting of complete lockdown would not be advisable as major festivals like Eid and Bada Mangal are falling next month. Besides, the lockdown is a must to contain the spread of new coronavirus infection in more areas of the state, the ministers told the CM. However, major relaxations could be given in districts from where no case has been reported so far, they added. The CM also sought views of various groups headed by the deputy CMs and the senior ministers for the revival of economy as well as academic activities.

Expressing concern over problems being faced by the poor and vulnerable sections post-lockdown as economic activities have come to a standstill, the CM said that urgent steps are needed to revive the economy.
