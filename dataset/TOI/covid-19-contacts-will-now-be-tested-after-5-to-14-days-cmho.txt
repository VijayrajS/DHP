BHOPAL: In the midst of Covid-19 pandemic, health department has changed its strategy of immediate testing of the traced contacts, as an early negative report gives a false sense of security to the suspect, said Bhopal’s chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Dr Prabhakar Tiwari.Close contacts of a Covid-19 patient, will now be tested after a gap of 5 to 14 days, said CMHO.

According to additional director general, ICMR, Dr GS Toteja, diagnosis of Covid-19 infection is RT- PCR test of throat and/or nasal swab, which detects virus at an early stage. As per the new guidelines, asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact with a Covid-19 patient.


 


Dr Tiwari reiterated that all other ICMR guidelines for those who came in close contact with a positive patient, however, remain the same. It includes home quarantine or institution quarantine for family and close contacts, he added.

Replying to query over delay in testing and instances of close contacts including family members of a positive patient not being tested even after patient’s death, the CMHO said, “We would take immediate measures if such instances are reported.”

Bhopal has reported over 400 Covid-19 cases. The disease is characterised in its most severe form by acute immune responses that render the patient susceptible to cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress.

Current estimates of the incubation period of COVID range from 2-14 days. Most common symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough and breathing difficulty. Upper respiratory tract symptoms including sore throat, rhinorrhoea, and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhoea and nausea/ vomiting are seen in about 20 per cent cases.
