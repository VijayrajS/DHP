The name of IIT-Delhi was also proposed. However, many in the institute allegedly objected to the idea raising concerns about the safety of their international students and faculty.

In Mumbai, the buildings that were taken over included the hostels of Bhaba Atomic Research Centre. Many students and the administration were actually opposed to the idea. At MANUU too, many students had objected to the idea alleging that this would put them at risk.

A senior member of IIT-D, on condition of anonymity, said, “We received a mail from the lieutenant governor’s office informing us that they would be needing our campus to be used as a quarantine centre. But we informed them that it cannot happen as we have a huge number of international students still in campus and we also have our faculty whom we cannot put at risk.”

The administration also informed the LG office that they have only 45 rooms in their guest house which would not be sufficient for them. IIT-D is however yet to get a response from the government on this. The institute had already asked their students to vacate the hostels by March 15 midnight.
