UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Pasteur Institute of India (PII) in Coonoor in the Nilgiris is all set to test samples for Covid-19 after getting approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the ministry of health and family welfare.


PII is one of the leading institutes that produces anti-rabies vaccine and DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) group of vaccines for the expanded programme of immunization of the Government of India.

With capacity to conduct 80 real-time polymerase chain reaction tests a day, the institute will start the test this week, PII director Dr Sivakumar told TOI.

While PII will provide the lab facility and the manpower for the real-time PCR test, the district health department will provide the test kits, swabs and blood.

“The lab capacity in PII is more than enough as far as the Nilgiris is concerned,” collector J Innocent Divya said.

Till date, samples taken from suspected patients were sent to the ESI hospital in Coimbatore for test.
