Vijayawada: In the past one week, Visakhapatnam Task Force police nabbed over 40 persons for playing cards and gambling in open places such as mango orchards, playgrounds and beaches. They also seized over Rs 1 lakh in cash from the gamblers.

“Despite repeated instructions and appeals from the police, a few people have been defying the lockdown and gambling. We have been coming across groups of six to ten people playing cards in the ope, said ACP (Task Force), Visakhapatnam, A Trinad Rao.

But busting of gambling activities and arresting the gamblers are not easy, police sources said. Earlier, gamblers used to often change their places to evade police raids. “We are dependent on informants to get concrete information to conduct raids. Often we receive information from a gambler who felt he was cheated. But the general public who do not like the gambling activities also used to inform us,” police said. TNN
