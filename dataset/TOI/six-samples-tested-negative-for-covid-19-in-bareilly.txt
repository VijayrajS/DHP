BAREILLY: Samples of six persons which were collected in the last two days, tested negative for novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Bareilly has not reported any positive case of Covid-19 so far, and health officials said they should not heed rumours on social media. Though no confirmed case has been reported, some fake messages are being circulated on social media that a Bareilly resident has tested positive.


Elsewhere, a 19-year-old boy was admitted in the isolation ward of district hospital on Wednesday, after he showed symptoms of Covid-19. 

Additional chief medical officer Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “In the last two months, we had collected samples of 21 people who showed symptoms of Covid-19 in Bareilly. Of these, 18 people have tested negative, while the reports of three cases are awaited.”

In Bareilly, samples of suspected cases are currently being collected only at district hospital. Health officials said they are currently checking facilities of sample collection at other private medical colleges, and if they are equipped with necessary kits, they will be given permission to collect samples. However, the health department will send samples to a government laboratory in Lucknow for testing.
