MoS refuses ‘home quarantined’ label on Raiganj house, claims defame plot
2020-04-06
Malda: Union minister of state Debasree Chaudhuri sparked controversy when she refused to be notified as ‘home-quarantined’, saying the move was ‘politically motivated’ to ‘defame’ her. 

Two days back, she had taken to the streets to distribute masks and sanitizers, drawing criticism. Congress MLA Mohit Sengupta and TMC-run Raiganj Municipality chairman Sand-ip Biswas claimed she violated the 14-day quarantine. 

The district administration then sent a team of health workers to the Raiganj MP’s home on Saturday morning but were spurned. 

When block medical officer (health) Sandip Bag and IC Suraj Thapa called on her at night, she said she 

 wanted to see an official order, but they failed to show any. They left after a heated argument.

Chaudhuri later said: “My home quarantine period ends on April 6. I am maintaining all norms. Still, the local administration is after me. I came back from Delhi on March 23 on a flight along with TMC MPs such as Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Sougata Roy. Is such a notice displayed on their homes? It is a sheer politically motivated step to defame me. Such a notice would only trigger panic among neighbours.” 

The administration refused to comment on the issue.
