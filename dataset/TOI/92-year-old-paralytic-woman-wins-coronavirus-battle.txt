Pune: A 92-year-old paralytic woman is among the 12 Covid-19 patients who are ready to be discharged from the Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre in Lavale after recovery.The woman, along with her four family members, had tested positive on April 8. “As per the protocol, the woman with four family members and others were tested and their reports came negative on Monday,” Vijay Natarajan, CEO of the hospital, said.He said the case of the 92-year-old woman, besides that of a 60-year-old with polio, showed that high-risk groups too could recover completely within two weeks.“She had a stroke seven months ago and had been bedridden, since then,” the woman’s daughter-in-law told TOI. She said, “My son was the first in the family to be detected with the contagion, following which all of us decided to get tested.”The daughter-in-law said her son was still admitted at Jehangir Hospital as his latest test was positive. The 12 patients had cleared the 24-hour test, but the health department logistical support and paperwork had delayed their discharge on Monday, Symbiosis hospital’s CEO Natarajan said, adding that they would be discharged by Tuesday morning.
