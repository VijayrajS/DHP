West Bengal: Ramakrishna Mission opens gates to Covid-19 warriors
2020-05-03
HOWRAH: The Ramakrishna Mission has decided to provide logistical support in the battle against coronavirus. It has made arrangements at its guest house at Belur Math where 26 health workers — doctors and nurses — have been accommodated. These doctors and nurses are in the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 by treating patients at TL Jaiswal Hospital. Belur Math is located barely 2km from the hospital.


Swami Subratananda, in charge of the guest house, said, “Some doctors and nurses of TL Jaiswal Hospital are serving patients and staying at our guest house. Ramakrishna Mission has always come forward in the service of mankind. This time, too, at the request of senior district administration officials, we have accommodated doctors and nurses at the guest house to enable them give more time to their jobs.”

Howrah district administration sources said they had sent a request to the Belur Math authorities two weeks ago to allow doctors and nurses of TL Jaiswal Hospital stay at the guest house. This request was accepted promptly.

Howrah CMOH Bhabani Das said, “We are grateful to Belur Math authorities for accepting our request and accommodating doctors and nurses of TL Jaiswal Hospital at their guest house. This is enabling them to perform their duties better.”
