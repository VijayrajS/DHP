2020-03-18
TIRUNELVELI: A Covid-19 sensitisation and preventive measures awareness programme for armed reserve police personnel was organised jointly by the Tirunelveli city police and Tirunelveli Corporation here on Tuesday. It is part of the two-day initiative to cover more than 450 police personnel on Covid-19 preventive measures.


“Private companies are promoting work from home option to prevent spread of Covid-19. The government is emphasising on social distancing for this purpose. But police personnel at the field level cannot enjoy these as duty demands their presence in hard conditions in which they have to work with the masses,” deputy commissioner of police, A Saravanan said.

The officer said that armed reserve personnel have to escort prisoners to the courts in other districts and neighbouring states and they cannot avoid touching handrails and similar things that could result in spreading Covid-19. Police engaged in crowd control too can contract with carriers of the virus.“They cannot wash their hands with soap and running water 10 times a day. Under their working conditions they could end up becoming carriers of the virus. So we asked them to wash their hands with soap soon after reaching home. They were also asked to use masks or handkerchiefs to cover their nose,” the officer said. Saravanan said that liquid soap and water to wash hands have been made available at all police stations in the city and at the office of the city police commissioner.tnn
