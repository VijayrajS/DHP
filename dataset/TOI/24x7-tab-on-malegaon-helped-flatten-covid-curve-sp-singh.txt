2020-06-14
Nashik: “Outstanding work, Team Malegaon,” was the message that superintendent of Nashik rural police Arti Singh received from state director general of police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal for the rural police’s successful efforts in flattening the Covid-19 curve in the textile town during the lockdown.The Nashik rural police played a mssive role in flattening the Covid-19 curve in the textile town as it had to enforce the lockdown especially in those areas which are thickly populated and where big families resided in small dwellings. As many as 186 policemen deputed on bandobast duty in Malegaon had contracted Covid-19 and three of them succumbed. Singh, who herself camped in Malegaon during the lockdown, told TOI that the rural police kept a 24X7 tab on the textile town. According to her, it was difficult to restrict people from visiting the 600-odd mosques in the town for the Friday prayers. On the occasion of Eid, police ensured people offered prayers at home instead of congregating at the Eidgah Maidan. Police teams also undertook daily flag marches to send out the message that strict action would be taken against those violating norms. Religious functionaries were roped in to reach out to people. “A well-known religious leader had succumbed to Covid-19. We were successful in convincing his followers not to attend his funeral,” said Singh adding that they also had to convince the Mangal Karyalay owners to house the policemen in their facilities. “We also had to hold counselling sessions to keep the cops’ morale high. We used to interact with the family members of the jawans as well,” said Singh.The rural police regularly provided dry ration kits and sanitizers to people free of cost. Moreover, during the month of Ramzan, police ensured that there was adequate supply of essentials, especially dry fruits.
