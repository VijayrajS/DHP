Horticulture crops rot due to lockdown
2020-04-03
ONGOLE: Farmers of horticulture crops such as papaya and pomegranate are badly hit due to the lockdown across the country. 

Fruits are drying up in nurseries in thousands of acres in Prakasam district. Moreover, big merchants, including exporters from Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra, were unable to visit the fields to purchase the stocks. 

They usually bring their vehicles and shift the stocks. But prices have nosedived as local traders are picking up small quantities as they are facing troubles shifting the stocks to the markets.

Mandals such as Yerragondapalem, Tripuranthakam, Pullalacheruvu mandals are arid region and farmers need irrigation facility to grow cash crops. 

The delay in completion of Veligonda major irrigation project, designed to irrigate the upland areas, prompted a few farmers to change over to horticulture crops in the region. After seeing them succeed, a substantial number of farmers followed in their footsteps and started cultivating horticulture crops. 

The decision was necessarily wrong as they reaped rich dividend from the horticulture crops in the last two years. 

Exporters thronged the remote areas of Prakasam district. Moreover, with a considerable demand for fruits, especially in urban areas, exporters offered decent prices to farmers.

However, the nationwide lockdown has changed the game. No trader has turned up in the last three weeks. 

“Fruits are completely ripe and falling off the trees as we cannot pick them due to shortage of workers and absence of trader,” rued a farmer Venkateswara Reddy of Yerragondapalem. 

Although, the Centre has relaxed restrictions on shifting of agriculture commodities, the merchants from northern states are reportedly not keen to make a trip for fear of facing police harassment at the state borders.
