Covid-19 in Pune: Market Yard to be closed on Friday for disinfection drive
2020-03-19
PUNE: The wholesalers and commission agents at the Gultekdi Market Yard have announced a daylong closure on Friday to conduct a disinfection drive in the facility, in the wake of the novel coronavirus spread.


The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) said it would provide necessary facilities at the market to unload vegetables and fruits sent by the farmers on Friday, though the commission agents would not work. 

“We are planning adequate measures for unloading the farm produce and assisting the local vendors to purchase vegetables from the farmers. This will assure the local city market gets the supply of vegetables and fruits despite closure by traders,” BJ Deshmukh, the administrator at APMC Pune, said. 

Vilas Bhujbal, head of the association of commission agents at APMC, said, “We had a meeting of members on Wednesday. It was observed that the entire area of the wholesale market would have to be disinfected. We have planned a shutdown on Friday. Saturday is weekly off for the market. So, the APMC administration will get two days to conduct the drive.” tnn
