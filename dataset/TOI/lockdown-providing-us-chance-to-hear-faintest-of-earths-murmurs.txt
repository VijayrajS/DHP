‘Lockdown providing us chance to hear faintest of Earth’s murmurs’

Ahmedabad: The impact of lockdown can also be felt beneath ground as ‘ears’ of the seismic monitors have become sharper, said Dr M Ravi Kumar, director general of Gandhinagar-based Institute of Seismological Research (ISR). He was talking at a webinar titled ‘Coronavirus lockdown – Effects on Seismic Noise and Seismicity’ organized by Gujarat Council on Science & Technology (GUJCOST) on Thursday.

Dr Kumar said that ‘cultural vibrations’ in seismological study are signals caused by human activity. “During daytime, it fell by 50-75% and in night, it went down by 30-84%. It has provided us an opportunity to listen more keenly to what’s happening beneath the surface,” he said. “Lockdown is providing us chance to hear the Earth’s faintest murmurs. It’s equivalent to installing expensive seismometers several meters into the soil.”

He added that a scenario like this can help us identify micro-earthquakes which could point towards larger seismic activities. “One of the interesting outcomes of the study during lockdown is drastic reduction in seismicity in Surendranagar – it points towards stopping of quarry blasts,” he said.

Dr Narottam Sahoo, advisor to GUJCOST, said that the lecture was part of ongoing webinar series on science communication from May 10 to 16. Primary focus of the initiative, jointly organized with National Council on Science & Technology Communication (NCSTC), was to engage students and researchers during lockdown, he said.

“Some of the experts who were part of the series included Dr Manoj Pattairiya, head of NCSTC; Prof Man Singh from Central University of Gujarat; Prof CG Joshi from GBRC; Dr S Kanan, director of CSMCRI, Bhavnagar and Dr BK Tyagi from Vigyan Prasar,” he said, adding that the participants are from across India.
