2020-05-26
Pune: An under-trial prisoner on Sunday afternoon tried to flee a quarantine centre in front of the Yerawada central jail, only to be caught by police and end up in the similar facility again. 

The prisoner broke the wooden door of his first-floor room and was about to jump on the ground floor when the on-duty policemen apprehended him. After registering an offence, the prisoner was lodged in another room of the same quarantine facility.

The prison administration has set up the quarantine facility for the suspects arrested in various crimes and are sent by courts to jail under judicial custody. The jail authorities first put them under a 14-day quarantine at the facility and then move them into the main prison. 

“The police had arrested Nigdi resident Balasaheb Govind Kamble (50) on Sunday morning for a body offence. Later, a court ordered Kamble’s remand in judicial custody and he was taken to the jail where he was first moved into the quarantine facility,” inspector Ajay Waghmare of the Yerawada police told TOI.

The facility is jointly manned by the prison and the city police personnel. “Kamble was locked in a room. He repeatedly kicked and punched the wooden door till it broke down. He then went to the verandah of the building and was about to jump over the first floor railings when the police apprehended him,” Waghmare said.
