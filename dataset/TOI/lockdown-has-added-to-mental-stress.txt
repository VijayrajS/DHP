Lockdown has added to mental stress

My neighbourhood has been an a containment zone since March 30 when an elderly man next door tested positive for Covid-19. Two days later, the man died, worsening our fear as the cops and civic authorities sealed all lanes around our home, conducted a door-to-door health survey followed by a disinfection drive.

Since the start of the lockdown, my work started getting affected. I no longer had access to the library and the department computers that had the necessary software, which are extremely important to complete my thesis.

Our work requires a lot of field work and that has come to a standstill. This is troubling for some of my junior colleagues.

After the containment zone was demarcated, life got more troublesome. With most shops in our locality being closed, medicine shops running out of stocks and no outsiders — including delivery personnel — being allowed in the locality, it has become extremely difficult to lead a normal life. More than the trouble associated with the physical aspects, the mental stress has aggravated manifolds as I have elderly residents and kids in the house.
