One of the three who tested positive was a 27-year old technician in Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital who went to Villupuram to see his wife who was pregnant. He returned for duty on Tuesday last, when he was tested. And the results have found him to be positive. He has now been admitted in ESI hospital for treatment. Health officials have traced more than a dozen people he came into close contact with and have collected samples from them too. The place he worked at the hospital has been fumigated. One of the other two people was a man who returned from New Delhi and one a resident of the city.

Health officials said that most of the cases in Coimbatore as well as neighboring districts were imported cases, due to influx of people from other districts.
