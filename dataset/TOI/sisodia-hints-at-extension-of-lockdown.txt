Manish Sisodia hints at extension of lockdown in Delhi
2020-04-10
NEW DELHI: The lockdown in the capital may be extended beyond April 14 if the Covid-19-positive cases continue to rise in a similar manner as prevalent now. “The final decision to extend the lockdown will be taken on April 13 or 14,” deputy CM Manish Sisodia told TOI.


The duration of the extension will be decided after the government reviews the current situation. The hint of the lockdown being extended in Delhi follows Odisha government’s decision to keep restrictions in place till April 30.

The fight against coronavirus has entered a crucial phase in Delhi. A house in C-Block of Defence Colony was sealed on Thursday after three people with foreign travel history were suspected to be infected with novel coronavirus. However, the entire block was not turned into a containment zone.

The government also converted Sadar Bazar and Shastri Market in South Moti Bagh into containment zones. This takes the total number of containment zones from 21 to 23. A screening exercise of residents showing symptoms of Covid-19 was started on Thursday. The drive is likely to be intensified.

All containment zones are under observation of police and district authorities. No person can move within the zone for any purpose and no outsider can enter such areas. An FIR will be lodged against people who violate the containment order. Delhi government has already made it compulsory for everyone stepping out of their houses to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
