2020-03-17
PUNE: Barely two hours after he arrived in Pune from Seattle, the 21-year-old student walked into Naidu hospital for a check for Covid-19.

His first test failed but the second test was positive, and, the student told TOI on Monday, he had come from a place where COVID-19 was widespread. So, it made sense to get tested.

On Monday, he said was recovering well and prepared to spend the quarantine period at the hospital with loads of books and his laptop. "I came here well-prepared and have books for company. I am able to watch shows to spend my time. Besides, my friends are connected through WhatsApp," he said.

He said after the outbreak in Seattle when he departed around March 9 he had a notion that he could have caught the infection. His graduation is three months away so he had time off till then and decided to come back.

He said, "I landed in Mumbai on March 10 and met the parents of my friends and left in a cab for Pune. I reached home by 6.30am and spent some time with my parents. I had a sore throat and had a bit of a cough."

His mother called a cousin who was a doctor who suggested he get himself tested. "At Naidu hospital, I told them about my travel history and they immediately tested me and put me into a quarantine facility. The first test was clear, but two to three days later another test report was positive," the student said.

Doctors at the hospital said the 21-year-old had shown maturity to self-report and get tested. “I have parents at home who are in their late-50s and considering the public at large, I decided to self-report."

He said doctors were on regular rounds and although they served food, he preferred home food which he got.
