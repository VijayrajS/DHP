2020-04-16
Ranchi: The state unit of BJP on Wednesday submitted a memorandum to Jharkhand governor Droupadi Murmu via email seeking her intervention for strict enforcement of the lockdown, especially in the Covid-19 hotspots. The saffron party also alleged the Hemant Soren of doing precious little to curb trouble-mongers in the high risk zones like Hindpiri.

In the letter, signed jointly by the state BJP president Deepak Prakash and leader of legislative party Babulal Marandi, BJP citied a few recent instances of lockdown violations in Ranchi’s Hindpiri locality in the last few days and how the administration allegedly failed to curb them.

“The second phase of the lockdown has begun and the entire nation is united in the fight against coronavirus. However, in Jharkhand, it seems that the government is only interested in blaming the Union government despite the latter extending all possible assistance,” the letter reads.

“On the contrary, the state government seems to deliberately act slow against trouble-mongers in Hindpiri despite serial violations by the residents there. Out of 27 covid-19 cases, 13 are from Hindpiri, but still the administration has not been able to enforce the lockdown properly, putting others in risk,” the letter further read.

It added, “Corona warriors like cleaning staff and police are constantly being troubled and ridiculed by local residents through protests against them. Reported instances of spitting or vandalism on ambulances have also come in, but the government machinery has failed to act tough. In such situations, the party requests your intervention to direct the government for strict enforcement of the lockdown in Ranchi and other hotspots.”
