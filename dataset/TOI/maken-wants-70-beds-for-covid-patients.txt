NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Ajay Maken on Tuesday moved the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) demanding that the Centre and Delhi government reserve 70% of the total hospital beds for Covid-19 patients.


Maken claimed that only 8% of the 57,194 available hospital beds in Delhi were being utilised for treatment of Covid patients. He added that only 12% of beds in Delhi government health facilities, 8% in central and 7% of the private hospital beds had currently been kept aside to treat coronavirus patients.

He added that around 70% of the dedicated beds in Delhi were vacant while patients were struggling to get one. “I request NHRC to issue appropriate directions to Delhi government for ensuring that those suffering from coronavirus and in need of beds, must be given admission without any further hardship. At least 70% of the bed capacity should be prepared and reserved for Covid patients,” Maken said.

The former Delhi Congress chief also said that as per the latest Delhi health bulletin, 27 of every 100 persons being tested were Covid-19 positive, while sources of more than 50% were untraceable. “Efforts should be made to test anyone coming in contact with a symptomatic patient without any delay and the city should not be opened up further unless the positivity rate comes down to less than 10%,” he added.

He urged the commission to direct Delhi government to designate 70% hospitals under its jurisdiction as corona health facilities. Currently, five of 38 are designated Covid-19 hospitals.

Further, he requested NHRC to augment CNG crematorium facilities across the capital.
