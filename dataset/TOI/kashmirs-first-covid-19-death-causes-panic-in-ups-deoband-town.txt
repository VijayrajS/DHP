Meerut: The first Covid-19 death in Kashmir after a 65-year-old patient who had tested positive earlier succumbed on Thursday in a Srinagar hospital has created panic in Deoband town of UP’s Saharanpur.The patient, who was part of a ‘Tabligi Jamaat’ (religious preachers), had stayed in a mosque in Deoband for three days earlier this month. He had a contact history with foreigners before he arrived in the valley. He had reportedly returned from New Delhi recently after being part of the jamaat which was attended by people from Indonesia and Malaysia.On Thursday afternoon, a health team rushed to Mohammadiya Mosque situated in Khankaah locality of Deoband, santitized the whole area, shut down the building and also took away with them three persons who had close contact with him.Saharanpur senior superintendent of police Dinesh Kumar P told TOI, “The senior citizen had visited Deoband on March 9 and stayed here till March 11. He died in Kashmir on Thursday because of novel coronavirus. We cannot say with certainty if he was already infected at that moment because there is a gap of 13 days after he left Deoband by train. But we are taking no chances. Entire area has been sanitized and people are being asked to stay indoors. Three persons, who had come in contact with him, have been isolated.” Before being admitted to the hospital in Srinagar, the religious preacher had come into contact with some local doctors, nurses and paramedics in addition to attending a couple of religious congregations in Sopore town of Kashmir’s Baramulla district. Among the many that he came in contact with, four had tested positive on Wednesday.
