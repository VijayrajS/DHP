Covid-19: Special flight to take Germans home
2020-03-28
MYSURU: A special flight carrying German nationals, including 16 tourists in Mysuru, will depart the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on Saturday for their home country. Due to increasing Covid-19 cases in India, the German embassy had asked Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to make arrangements to send the stranded Germans back.


Accordingly, the authorities in Mysuru arranged the Germans’ travel to Bengaluru on Friday after the tourists underwent medical test at a temporary camp at Kalamandira. After confirming their fitness, they were taken to the German consulate in Bengaluru in a non-air conditioned luxury bus which had a paper with Covid-19 written on it pasted to its windshield.

Tourism department deputy director H P Janardhan said, “We had got the list of 18 Germans who had come to Mysuru. Among them, two had already returned to their country. We are sending the 16 Germans to Bengaluru from where they will be sent to their country in a special flight,” he said.
