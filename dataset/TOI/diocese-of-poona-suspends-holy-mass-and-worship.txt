2020-03-19
PUNE: The Diocese of Poona has suspended worship and Holy Mass, including on Sundays, till further notice, because of the novel coronavirus spread. 


In an advisory to priests and the Catholic faithful, Father Malcolm Sequeira, vicar general of the diocese, communicated the suspension of services on behalf of Bishop Thomas Dabre.

The diocese had earlier issued comprehensive guidelines to all churches and chapels to conduct prayers and Mass while making provision for hand sanitizers at entrances and to avoid embraces, among other measures. 

The advisory stated, “In view of the rising cases of the coronavirus pandemic, Mass and worship in the Diocese of Poona in the presence of the faithful have been suspended till further notice. Let us manifest our solidarity with the authorities and also with all humanity because coranvirus is a threat to humanity.” 

The Diocese of Poona has 39 churches in its care, spread across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, Solapur, Kolhapur, Miraj and Sangli.

Speaking to TOI, Fr Sequeira said even area-wise Masses, the Way of the Cross which depicts Christ’s journey to his crucifixion and a major Catholic Charismatic programme to be held on Sunday stand cancelled. 

Father Sequeira hopes the situation will ease before Holy Week begins on April 5. Good Friday is observed during the week.
