PATNA: As a precautionary measure after the coronavirus outbreak in China and its spread in other parts of the world, the state health department is planning to install a thermal screening camera at Gaya international airport to check the temperature of passengers at immigration point there itself, an official said on Monday.

The only international airport of the state lacks even airport health organization (APHO), which functions like a health centre and has been established at all the other international airports of the country.

Official sources said the need to install a thermal screening camera at Gaya airport was discussed at a state health department meeting on Monday. “Very soon it will be made available,” said the official present in the meeting.

Though civil aviation ministry last week had instructed seven international airports in the country with direct flights from China and Hong Kong to make arrangements for screening of passengers, Gaya was not among them. Gaya airport director Dilip Kumar had earlier said the reason behind skipping Gaya was because it did not have a direct flight from China.

However, this airport has flights from Yangon in Myanmar, Paro in Bhutan and Hanoi in Vietnam.

When asked about the lack of APHO, ministry of health and family welfare senior regional director (Bihar and Jharkhand) Dr Kailash Kumar said though the staff there had been sensitized about the issue and guidelines had been shared with them. “Doctors and other health officials will be deployed there from Tuesday,” he added.

Meanwhile, considering the possibility of a coronavirus suspect landing at Gaya airport, a 10-bed isolation ward has been set up at Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH), said Gaya civil surgeon Dr BK Singh.

Tourists from Nepal being screened on border: Tourists coming from Nepal are thoroughly screened on the border, especially at Forbesganj and Raxaul after the state health department’s high alert following the outbreak of coronavirus in China and one confirmed case in Nepal. State government is monitoring the situation from Raxaul and Jogbani immigration offices situated on the 1750km-long porous India Nepal border adjoining Bihar.

Focus is on the passengers from China having symptom of flu. East Champaran civil surgeon Dr Rizwan Ahmad said a medical team headed by Dr Sharad Chandra Sharma was stationed at the Raxaul immigration office. “Special focus is on the tourists having Chinese passport. Today, a Chinese returning to Bodh Gaya from Kathmandu was thoroughly checked. However, no symptom was detected,” he said. Intense screening is being done even on the Nepal side, he added.
