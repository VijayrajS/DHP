2020-02-14
PANAJI: The cumulative count of persons who have been monitored for novel coronavirus infection in Goa has reached 45, of which ten patients have completed their mandatory 28-day quarantine period. While 35 travelers continue to be under observation, no new cases of suspected nCoV were reported on Thursday. A foreigner who was quarantined in the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, since last week, was discharged two days ago. 

State epidemiologist Utkarsh Betodkar, said the numbers are likely to dip due to the travel restrictions in force. Stating that they are prepared to handle any eventuality, he said, “I don’t think the number of cases (suspected) will increase,” he said. 

The directorate of health services (DHS) sends samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, and in suspected cases, samples are collected and tested twice within a span of 24 hours, he said. 

For persons who test positive for cornonavirus, he said, it is required to test samples every day, since the disease is new. This also helps to study the disease, Betodkar said. 

“Travelers under observation are advised to maintain a distance of around a metre, even when interacting with their family members, to reduce the risk of transmission, just in case, he/she is a carrier,” Dr Betodkar said. 

A local health official keeps a tab on the cases in their area. “The travelers are house-quarantined instead of in the hospital,” he said. 

He said that 14 days’ quarantine is adequate, but the period is doubled in order to be on the safer side.
