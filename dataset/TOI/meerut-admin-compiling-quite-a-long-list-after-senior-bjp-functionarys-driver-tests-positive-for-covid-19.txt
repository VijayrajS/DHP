MEERUT: A senior BJP functionary and his family members were on Wednesday quarantined after his assistant was tested positive for novel coronavirus in Meerut. 


The health department was now busy compiling the list of all the contacts of the BJP worker-- which officials said was quite long and full of high-profile people-- as he was actively involved in distribution of food packets to the needy, had met police officers and politicians, including a Union minister and some MPs.

The father of the assistant had tested positive on Tuesday, and, later, both his sons were also found infected. The politician and his family members have been put under quarantine at Subharti Medical College.

Asked what steps will be taken as the politician had attended several programmes, Meerut’s chief medical officer Dr Raj Kumar said, “We have to track the contact chain, which is indeed long. And whoever he came in contact with will be quarantined and proper steps will be taken to break the chain. Currently, he and his family have been quarantined at Subharti Medical College. A list of other contacts is also being prepared.”

While Meerut’s district surveillance officer Dr Vishwas Chaudhary said that the assistant even drove the BJP functionary’s car.

“The samples of all the first contacts of the positive case have been taken. He even drove the BJP worker’s car, so it will be wrong to say that he did not accompany him to all those events. However, the other high-profile cases would still be the second line of contacts. All precautions are being taken and the list of people who will be quarantined is being prepared,” he said.
