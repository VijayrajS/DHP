NEW DELHI: Jamia Millia Islamia issued a notice to its students on Friday, asking those staying at the hostels to vacate the premises as the university is in proximity to major containment zones like Zakir Nagar.

The Jamia administration told students that the university will only open in August and the new academic session will start only from September. The exam schedule for July will also be changed. “At the moment for all purposes the university is closed and library and other institutional facilities are closed in view of lockdown,” the order said.

The administration told the students to contact the provost of the institution that will make the arrangements for their travel back home. Many students have been stuck at the varsity since the lockdown was put in place.

“It is difficult for the university to maintain logistics and manpower requirements in future. The hostels are require sanitisation, and maintenance . Therefore, the hostels are completely vacated completely,” the order said.
