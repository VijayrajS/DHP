AHMEDABAD: Pained at seeing the bodies of Covid-19 victims take a nine-foot fall into the burial pit Mohammed Sharif Kakuwala ( Astodia Bhajiawale), of the famous Astodia Bhajia house, develop a stretcher attached with 15-foot straps that can lower the dead into their graves with dignity. He has now made this special stretcher available for free at all major graveyards in the city.

It began when Yasmin Hanif Pipdavala, 45, who was among the first Covid-19 causalities from Kakuwala’s neighbourhood near Ismail Pir ki dargah, died and paramedic staff carried the body to the graveyard. “I saw that the cloth used to lower body could only take the body two feet down and the paramedics had to let the body fall to the 10-foot depth of the pit of the especially deep burial pit for a Covid-19 victim. Normally the pits are about six feet deep. It pained me that even the dead from this pandemic don’t get a respectable burial.” 

Kakuwala contacted a local tailor and got cloth stretchers made with 15-foot straps. “I made sure that I contacted each and gave them three or four of these stretchers so people are not inconvenienced during the lockdown,” says Kakuwala.

He adds that these stretchers are free for all communities using burial rites. “The entire stretcher including the straps can decompose and can handle weights of up to 150kg. I have placed orders for more of them,” says Kakuwala.
