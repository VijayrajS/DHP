2020-05-14
Jaipur: The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has extended the period for people to register birth and death due to ongoing pandemic.

According to rule, registration of birth and death has to be done within 21 days at JMC office to get certificate. Now, the registration can be done within 21 days after the lockdown period ends. 

The registration of birth and death has gone down by 25% due to pandemic. People are now struggling to fill forms and pay penalty fee as well. No registration could be done at the JMC office anymore and everything has been made online. People, who are not technically sound, are now struggling to fill the forms and complete all the formalities online.

Registrar of birth and death at JMC Pradeep Pareek said, “It is for the convenience of the people. Not everyone is well-equipped with technology and people are facing problems. So, for now, after the lockdown is lifted, within 21 days registration has to be made.”

This relaxation is given for births and death happening within the lockdown period not before or 21 days after the lifting of the lockdown.

Recently, the JMC had issued notification to the zonal offices to appoint one informer on each crematorium or graveyard in the city.

It is the job of the informer to send information about the number of cremations or burials occurred every day. There are more than 150 crematoriums and graveyards in Jaipur out of which only 30 have the facility of an informer. When a burial or cremation occurs, the informer gets a form filled by the family member in which details of the dead person, family members, cause of death, time of death and other such information is mentioned. It is the job of the informer to send the form back to the JMC and give one copy to the family.

No crematorium or graveyard authorities have informed the JMC about the appointment of informers. Hence, the JMC has sent a reminder to comply with its orders.
