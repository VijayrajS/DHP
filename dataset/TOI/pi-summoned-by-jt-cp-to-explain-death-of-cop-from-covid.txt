AHMEDABAD: In a first, IGP (Joint commissioner of police) Sector-2 has summoned the inspector of a police station to clarify the delay in hospitalization of a head constable, after the cop died of Covid-19 on May 18. Sources said Bharatsinh Thakore had tested Covid-19 positive on May 16 but was admitted to Gandhinagar Civil Hospital on the next day, on May 17. He breathed his last on May 18.


Police sources said when a policeman stands on the road to implement lockdown and is in direct threat of contracting Covid-19, it is the duty of seniors to look after his well-being and periodically ask him about health.

In this case, Thakore was on duty as police station officer (PSO) of Krishnanagar police station till May 14. “He complained of deteriorating health on May 14 and was sent to Naroda urban health centre. He tested positive on May 16 and was admitted to Gandhinagar Civil hospital on May 17. Had he been admitted on May 16, when he’d tested positive, his life could have been saved,” said a police official on condition of anonymity.

Sources said that after testing positive, Thakore had wanted to stay in home quarantine, but was rushed to hospital on May 17 when his condition worsened drastically.

Joint commissioner of police, Sector-2, Nipuna Torwane, told TOI that she has asked inspector J K Rathod of Krishnanagar police station to clarify in writing why there was delay in hospitalizing Thakore.

“Senior officers are always responsible for the well-being of subordinates. I have asked him to give the reasons for the delay,” said Torwane.

She added that inspector Rathod had been first summoned on May 24, but as another policeman of the same police station, ASI Girish Barot died on Sunday morning from Covid-19, Rathod has been summoned to appear on Monday.
