HYDERABAD: Two resident doctors in Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) have been placed under self-quarantine after a nephrology patient, who was examined by them, turned out to be a Covid-19 suspect. 


The 25-year-old nephrology patient reported to the hospital complaining of headache and stood in three different queues before being checked by the resident doctors. 

When the doctors asked him a few questions about his medical condition, the patient told them that he had been suffering from high fever and cough for 10 days.

Four family members also had similar symptoms. "On learning about the history, doctors alerted the resident medical officer who, in turn, activated the Covid-19 teams and informed police after which the patient was shifted to Gandhi Hospital," said a resident doctor.

Calling it a wake-up call, Dr Jay Singh Arora, convener, resident doctors' association, NIMS, said: "Unless a patient comes up at the OPD counter, there is no way of filtering the patients who have fever or other symptoms. Since younger Cvid-19 carriers can be asymptomatic, even if one such patient surpasses the protocol, the hospital can become a hotspot for transmission. Therefore, non-essential OP should be shut down like it has been in institutes like AIIMS and PGIMER, Chandigarh."
