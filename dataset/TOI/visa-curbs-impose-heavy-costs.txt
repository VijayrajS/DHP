Covid-19 outbreak: Visa curbs impose heavy costs
2020-03-13
AHMEDABAD: Several countries have imposed travel restrictions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. India followed suit on Wednesday by suspending all tourist visas from March 13 to April 15. The move has triggered anxiety among travellers, who are booking tickets at the last minute to fly back home.


“My relatives had come to Ahmedabad from the US to shop for an upcoming wedding and were to return on March 20,” said Sanjay Patel, an Ahmedabad businessman. “However, with the Indian government imposing restrictions on travel, they are worried about their departure and therefore have advanced their tickets to March 13.”

Tour operators said that a number of travellers had to pay extra to book tickets at the last minute while others who were scheduled to visit India had to bear cancellation charges.

Travel restrictions imposed by other countries have also caused problems for Indians who are unable to return. “My parents are in Doha for the past three months and were scheduled to return on March 14,” said Shebaz Katar, who works with a logistics company in Doha, Qatar. “However, with the government here imposing travel restrictions on about 14 countries including India, we had to cancel their tickets.” Hoteliers in Ahmedabad have begun receiving cancellations.
