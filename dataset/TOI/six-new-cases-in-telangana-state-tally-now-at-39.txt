The fourth patient is a 64-year-old housewife and a resident of Manikonda who does not have history of foreign travel history but a family member, who had gone abroad had tested positive. A bulletin released late in the evening by the health department mentioned that her condition was said to be stable. The fifth and sixth patients on Tuesday are from Bhadradri Kothagudem and have no foreign travel history. They were infected by a primary contact with history of foreign travel.

Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced that one person has been discharged so far and all the remaining 39 patients could be released by April 7 as their condition was stable now. “The coronavirus spread is stable in the country, but preventive measures are needed. We have asked collectors to seize passports of foreign returnees who are flouting home quarantine,” the chief minister said.

Lokesh Kumar, commissioner of GHMC, said they caught four coronavirus suspects, who violated home quarantine rules and were shifted to designated isolation centres. All four had returned from foreign counties and had ventured out of their homes, when they were caught by locals. So far, 77,045 passengers have been screened at the airports in the state.
