HYDERABAD: Health minister Eatala Rajender on Wednesday urged people not to come out in large numbers, even as two persons died and 41 new Covid-19 cases were reported in Telangana. The state also released 111 patients who recovered from the virus on Wednesday, making it the highest number of people getting discharged on a single day.


“With a more relaxed lockdown, more people are coming out. But these people needs to be careful,” Rajender said as the state added 10 migrants, who tested positive to its overall tally of 1367 cases.

“Because of migrants also, there is a fear of the virus spreading, but people must cooperate with the government to help contain the spread,” the minister said,

Health department officials said 798 people have reached Telangana from other countries recently, 229 by trains and 41,805 using the road network.

Rajender will hold a video conference with all employees and officials of the department on Thursday to take stock of the situation. 

Two employees working in the GHMC Charminar circle also tested positive apart from two from RK Puram and one from Rajendra Nagar.

A 38-year-old woman from Jiaguda with co-morbid conditions and a 74-year-old man from Saroonagar with kidney diseases died, raising the death total to 34.

The coronavirus caseload stands at 1367 with 939 people discharged and 394 active cases.
