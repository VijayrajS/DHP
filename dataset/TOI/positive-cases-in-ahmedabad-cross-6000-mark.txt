2020-05-12
AHMEDABAD: In India, Ahmedabad is on third spot in major cities after Mumbai (14,521) and Delhi (7,233). Chennai’s tally has now reached to 4,372. Except four major states, all other states have less cases than the district, reveal analysis.


Total deaths in the district also reached 400-mark on Monday – three of the deaths are recorded in Ahmedabad district outside AMC limits whereas 397 are recorded in the city. City is second in terms of mortality across India only after Mumbai.

“Cases are still coming from the identified hotspots and major drives are carried out to test maximum persons who might have come in contact with the positive patients and reduce the contact chain,” said an AMC official. “From the all-time high of 349 cases recorded on May 5, the cases are on constant decline and stringent lockdown could be one of the success factors.”

Out of the deaths in past seven days, 102 were men and 64 were women. State health department officials said that in majority of the deaths, the patients were found to have co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, existing health conditions such as kidney, heart or liver ailment and in some cases diseases such as cancer and mental health issues.
