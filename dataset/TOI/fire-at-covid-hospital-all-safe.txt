NEW DELHI: Eight patients admitted to Cygnus Orthocare Hospital — a designated Covid-19 care centre — were rescued after a fire broke out at the third floor of the hospital.

According to the fire department, a call was received around 5.54pm on Saturday about a blaze at the Cygnus Orthocare Hospital. Eight fire tenders were rushed to the spot. “Since the fire was at the hospital and that too a Covid-designated centre, we immediately made three teams of two persons and entered the building to douse the flames,” a fireman said. 

Eight patients, present in the hospital, were evacuated safely, which include five men and three women. Though there was smoke all around, the patients managed to walk and had to be guided for directions. The six fire officials, who went in to rescue the patients, were immediately rushed for sanitisation and had to change their fire gear.” Atul Garg, director of Delhi Fire Services, said.

As a precautionary measure, the fire department also advised office owners and other people who were using air conditioners after a long time to get it serviced properly to reduce the chance of fire. 

Dr Amit Vig, unit head at Cygnus, said: “A minor fire broke out in the SDA unit of the hospital on Saturday evening around 6pm. The fire was first reported in the third floor of the hospital, which houses operation theatres. Personnel from DFS, along with the hospital’s fire division, managed to control the blaze. There was no loss or damage to life. Everyone was moved to safe areas promptly in an organised fashion.”
