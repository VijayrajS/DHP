2020-02-25
Margao: More than two weeks after luxury cruise liner ‘Diamond Princess’ was quarantined off the coast of Japan, the 135 crew members from India, 50 of whom are Goans, are still spending anxious days and nights aboard the vessel— well after the completion of the14-day quarantine period.

Vivian Raikar, brother of Dhanasth who is among the Goan seafarers on board the cruiseliner told TOI on Monday that the latter called him stating that the situation was getting precarious with every passing day. “Crew members from all other countries have left the ship. The Indian crew members are now feeling dejected and depressed. We appeal to the Goa government to urge the Centre to take urgent steps to ensure the safe return of the Indian seafarers ,” Vivian said.

Dhanasth had earlier told TOI from the ship, soon after the vessel was quarantined, that the passengers were prohibited from disembarking for even a few minutes. “We can’t get any fresh air here,” Dhanasth had said, suggesting that that despondency had begun to set in among the passengers and the crew.

“All the passengers have gone back home. The Filipino crew members, numbering above 500, are also going back in two flights arranged by the Phillipines government. Only the Indians are now left on the ship. All the tests for coronavirus have returned negative. Is the government waiting for us to test positive in order to rescue us?” a crew member wearing a protective mask is heard asking in a video posted on social media.
