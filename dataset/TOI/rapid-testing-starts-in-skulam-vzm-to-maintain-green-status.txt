VISAKHAPATNAM: Following the Union health ministry declaring 11 of the state’s 13 districts as Covid hotspots or red zones, district administrations of both Vizianagaram and Srikakulam, which have been marked as green zone, have begun exercises to ensure their status remains unchanged.

Srikakulam collector J Nivas said the district has received 1,600 rapid-testing kits and around 80 people were tested on Thursday. SP RN Ammi Reddy said 17 checkposts have been set up at every entry and exist point in the district from neighbouring areas, including Odisha. These checkposts are aimed at preventing entry of people from adjacent areas, where Covid-19 positive cases have been reported, he added.

“We have installed disinfection tunnels at few of the checkposts such as Icchapuram and Pydi Bheemavaram to sanitise both humans and vehicles,” Ammi Reddy told TOI. Checkposts have been set up are Pydi Bheemavaram, Ullivalasa, Kamma Sigadam, Venkatapuram, Kancharam, Arasada, G Sigadam, Laveru, Rajam, Vangara and Veeragattam.

Vizianagaram collector M Hari Jawaharlal said they have set up checkposts on the borders, which Vizianagaram shares with Odisha and other Covid-affected districts. Besides, they have received 1,400 new rapid Covid testing kits from the government. The tests would be conducted from Friday. First, they would test patients with the primary symptoms and the next step would be decided depending on results.

As per the new categorisation, a hotspot district will be declared as an orange zone district, if it does not record any new case in the last 14 days. If the trend continues for the next 14 days, the district will be classified as a green zone.
