‘Govt must come clean on testing’
2020-05-23
Margao: Pointing out that there were “defects” in the details given in the daily medical bulletin issued by the government pertaining to number of Covid-19 cases reported, Congress demanded that the government come clean over the number of tests conducted, the methodology adopted for testing, and the final results. 

“Goa government should immediately put a full stop to the confusions in testing of Covid patients and should not play with the lives of the innocents. When there are doubts raised on the cause of death of two-time Congress MLA Jitendra Deshprabhu, now fresh reports are emerging on defects in Covid testing reports of people arriving from other states,” GPCC president Girish Chodankar said. 

Congress demanded health minister Vishwajit Rane clarify the reason for suspension of the approval for Covid testing given to a ICMR-approved private laboratory. “Rane should make it clear whether the Mobilo Diagnostics providing services at GMC are perfect and if there are no defects,” Chodankar said.
