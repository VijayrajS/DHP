Coimbatore: As many as 14 interstate routes between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, including nine check posts on the border that were sealed off on Saturday, will remain shut for non-essential movement of vehicles and people till March 31. Coimbatore collector K Rajamani, who visited the Walayar check post on Saturday, said only those vehicles carrying essential commodities such as medicines, milk, vegetables, fuel, and ambulances will be allowed to cross the border after the drivers and other personnel in the vehicles are subjected to Covid-19 screening. The vehicles will also be disinfected. “People who travel between the states to attend important events such as funerals and those travelling for essential work in public transport will be allowed to cross after proper screening,” Rajamani said.The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) has been operating very few buses to the neighbouring states due to reduced patronage.The collector said even pedestrians who come though the border will be tested. “We have 10 medical teams for testing. If need be, we will deploy more teams,” he said.Along with health officials, police personnel and revenue officials are also manning the border check posts. Superintendent of police Sujith Kumar said 500 police personnel will be deployed at the check posts. “They will stop tourists and other passengers who come on non-essential travel,” he said.
