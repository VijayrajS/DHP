Overseas Jamaatis to be quarantined for another 14 days
2020-04-18
Kanpur: District administration has taken a decision that even after completing their quarantine term, the overseas Tablighi Jamaatis will have to undergo another term.

This decision was taken on Thursday at a meeting of district administration officials, police and health authorities.

Several overseas Tablighi Jamaat members had come to India to attend the Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin Markaz in New Delhi. Eight members of the jamaat had to Kanpur while others went to other parts of the country. Among eight overseas Jamaatis, four were Afghani nationals, three Iranis and one of Britain.

After getting all of them quarantined on March 31, the police had registered cases against them under the Epidemic Act and the Foreigners Act. Police had also seized their visas and cancelled their passports. The most serious allegation against them was that they had visited India on a tourist visa but they were propagating their religion.

Their first sample test revealed that the two Afghanis were Covid-19 positive but the report of their second sample received on Wednesday stated that two Afghanistanis, three Iranis and one UK national tested negative.

It may be recalled that Bahraich district administration had sent 17 overseas Jamaatis to jail after they completed the quarantine period. It has to be seen what action the Kanpur district administration is going to take about the overseas Tablighi Jamaat members.

SSP/DIG Anand Deo said, â€œIt has been decided to keep them under quarantine for more term. After completion of this term, future course of action would be decided, he added.
