Thrissur: Five excise officials at Chavakkad were asked to undergo home quarantine on Thursday after they nabbed a ganja peddler who had come from a red zone in Bengaluru.

Excise inspector K V Babu, preventive officer K Sunilkumar and civil excise officers Rafi, Rajesh and Sudheer Kumar were told to be under home quarantine after they nabbed Kurukkalath Veettil Jaffar of Manathala near Chavakkad with 100g of ganja.

Jaffar, 42, came to Chavakkad with ganja on Wednesday, excise official said. When he realised excise officials were trailing him, he went absconding. On Thursday, he was arrested from a lodge at Blangad near Chavakkad where he was hiding.

The accused was admitted to the isolation ward at Taluk Hospital, Chavakkad.

Ironically, only 100g of ganja could be recovered from the accused even though the excise officials had chased him based on the inputs that he had brought 5kg of ganja from the neighbouring state. The accused must have sold the remaining quantity, and Rs 40,000 has been recovered from him, the excise officials said.

The officials fear criminals could be using lockdown as a cover to illegally bring in ganja from other states, and could try to keep off from the chasing officials claiming that they are coming from Covid-19 red zones. tnn
