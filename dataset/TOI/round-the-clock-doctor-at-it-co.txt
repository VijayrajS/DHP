“The medical centre is within the office premises, where employees can freely walk and get their questions and apprehensions answered, medically validated/checked and be suitably informed,” said Dr Megan Pinnamaneni, chief strategy officer of Tetrasoft.

Meanwhile, in view of anxiousness in the IT corridor after the positive Covid-19 case in the city, the ‘nodal committee for Covid-19 Cyberabad’ has issued standard operation protocol.

Screening of all visitors, barriers between employees and visitors, discouraging large gatherings which involve close proximity and encouraging use of technology for meetings was suggested. This is in addition to screening all employees having symptoms and recent travel history to affected countries, placing sanitizers and hand cleaning spaces.

While Telangana had witnessed one positive case as on date, there has been panic in IT corridor due to one un-confirmed case reported on 4th March which was ultimately proved negative. The primary objective of releasing SOP is to equip all IT companies/IT Parks to deal with situation, should there be any Covid-19 suspected case reported,” read the document.
