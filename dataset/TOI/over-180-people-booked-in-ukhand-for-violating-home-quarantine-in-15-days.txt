Dehradun: Uttarakhand police have registered 141 FIRs and booked 182 persons on charges of violating home quarantine orders in the past 15 days.

To contain the spread of the virus, the state authorities have directed all those who have returned to the state to follow home quarantine norms. The officials had earlier warned that all those who flout norms will be booked.

Ashok Kumar, Director General (DG) Law and Order, told TOI, “We have registered cases against 182 people for violating home quarantine orders. Basically, they all were roaming outside while they were supposed to stay inside their homes for 14 days.”

In majority of violation cases, the complaints were either made by neighbours of the offenders or gram pradhans of their respective villages. All the cases have been registered under section 188 (not obeying government orders) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
