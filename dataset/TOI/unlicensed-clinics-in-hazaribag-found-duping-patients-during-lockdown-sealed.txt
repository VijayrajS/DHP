Unlicensed clinics in Hazaribag found duping patients during lockdown, sealed
2020-04-27
Hazaribag: While many prominent hospitals and nursing homes in the district curtailing their operations to comply with the ongoing lockdown norms, several unlicensed health facilities are, however, duping patients and even putting the lives of the themselves and the patients at risk, prompting the district health officials to take action.

On Sunday, civil surgeon Dr Krishna Kumar said they have raided and sealed six unlicensed nursing homes across the district ever since lockdown was ordered on March 23. One of the owners was even fined Rs 48,000. “A report will be sent to the department about these illegal clinics,” Dr Kumar said. 

Besides sealing the six nursing homes, Dr Kumar said a probe has been ordered against the owner of a private clinic in Chouparan. The probe was ordered after an FIR was lodged against the clinic’s owner Chaman Sao. Ashish Das, the complainant, blamed Sao and his wife for medical negligence which caused the death of his pregnant sister Manju Devi (20) on April 23. 

In his FIR, Ashish said Manju went into labour and was admitted to Chouparan community health centre. Finding Manju’s case complicated, doctors referred her to the Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital (HMCH). 

While on their way to HMCH, Manju’s husband Mohan Ravidas was stopped by Sao, who convinced him to shift Manju to his clinic. At Ashiana Clinic, Sao’s wife treated Manju but she became critical. Manju was then referred to Chouparan CHC, where she died. 

The civil surgeon said, “The medical officer of Chouparan visited the clinic but the couple were absconding. Upon inquiry, it was found that the clinic did not possess a valid operational license. The team sealed the clinic in the presence of a magistrate. An inquiry is on to ascertain whether the patient died of medical negligence.”
