Process Covid-19 claims in 2 hours, regulator tells health insurers
2020-04-20
BENGALURU: The insurance regulator has asked companies providing health cover to approve hospital claims for cashless treatment of policyholders within two hours and has warned of strict action in case of non-compliance. Insurers have also been asked to set up a 24/7 mechanism for processing requests — so that late-night admissions also do not suffer.


In a circular released on Sunday, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India told insurers that they must put in place systems and procedures to ensure authorisations and claim settlement on a 24-hour basis. 

“Decision on final discharge shall be communicated to the network provider within two hours from the time of receipt of the final bill and last requirement from the hospital either to the insurer or to the third-party administrator (TPA) whichever is earlier,” said the regulator. Earlier, industry-practice was to work normal business hours. 

IRDAI said it will be closely monitoring time taken for each cashless request — after complaints that TPAs, insurers and officials were not being proactive in a pandemic like doctors, nurses and hospital staff.
