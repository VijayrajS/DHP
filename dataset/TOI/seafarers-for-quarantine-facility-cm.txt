Seafarers for quarantine facility: CM
2020-05-02
Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday that his government hasn’t taken any money from any individual seafarer for its paid quarantine facility. The CM, however, said that companies have expressed their willingness to pay the charges for their employees’ quarantine, and that there’s “nothing wrong with it”. 

Sawant told reporters that the state is providing free quarantine facility for those entering Goa from within India. “I have directed authorities not to charge individual seafarers,” he said. “We are not charging them individually, but companies are willing to bear the costs for paid quarantine.” 

He said that the government is paying hotels around Rs 2,000-2,500 per day for paid quarantine, and that there is nothing wrong if companies pay for their employees’ quarantine. Sawant also said that if any company brings in employees from outside the state, the employee concerned would have be kept in quarantine for at least three days till they’re tested and the result is out. He also said that anyone coming to Goa from outside the state will compulsorily have to undergo a Covid-19 test. 

Meanwhile, Sawant said that his government’s ratio of testing suspected persons to population is higher than other states. “We have tested almost 2,000 people for Covid-19 in Goa,” he said, adding that other states charge as much as Rs 4,000 for the test.

The chief minister also said on Friday that public transport in the state will not resume for now.
