PUNE: State BJP chief and Kothrud MLA Chandrakant Patil on Sunday praised the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for its efforts to control the spread of Covid-19 in Maharashtra. 


Early on Sunday, Patil visited the weekly market, ration shops and grocery stores in Kothrud to know the ground situation. He made an appeal to people to remain at home. 

Patil said the nationwide lockdown enforced by the BJP-led government at the Centre helped contain the spread of coronavirus and keep it below other countries. “In the state too, the government has taken efforts to control the spread of Covid-19,” Patil said. 

Patil however criticised the government for its resolution to provide foodgrain on ration after April 30. “People need it right now. I do not know why they are waiting till the month-end,” Patil said.

Patil said there was only one positive case so far in Kothrud. “From Day One of the lockdown, we made an effort to ensure that people did not step out of their houses unnecessarily. We people who were unable to cook and provided them lunch and dinner for just Rs5,” Patil said. 

Patil said he and his team have distributed 37,000 dry ration packets to people. “We have also identified about 4,500 ration card holders and will distribute wheat and rice to them from tomorrow,” Patil said

Patil pointed out that people continued to come out of their homes despite appeals by police and said they must be getting bored at home. “To keep them engaged, we have decided to provide 100 books to each colony. People can come down and take any book and return it the next day. We have collected 3,000 books so far and plan to collect 10,000 books in total to cover all major areas,” Patil said.
