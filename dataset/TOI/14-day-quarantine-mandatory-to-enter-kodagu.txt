14-day quarantine mandatory to enter Kodagu
2020-05-10
Mysuru: Determined to remain free from Covid-19, the district administration in Kodagu is refusing entry to even those who have police passes. Only those who are officially recognised as permanent residents of Kodagu are being allowed into the hilly district. 

Among those denied permission to enter the district was a 70-year-old resident of Mangaluru, while a Bengaluru doctor was allowed to enter Kodagu only after he agreed to a 14-day home quarantine. 

However, those being issued passes are not very happy with the state of affairs. It is not the district administration in Kodagu that they are miffed with, but officials in other districts, who are issuing passes when there are such conditions in place. 

Subray G Hegde of Mangaluru secured a pass to enter Kodagu district on May 7, and he was allowed to enter Kushalnagar. But he was sent back from Madikeri, citing that he was not a permanent resident of the district. “Although I showed that there was a house agreement in Kushalnagar, the authorities said that it was not sufficient,” he said. 

Kodagu deputy commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy said that she was not aware of people being sent back. “Inter-district movement is allowed if they are residents,” she said. 

Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan said that it was the responsibility of all to ensure that Covid-19 did not spread to the hilly district, which was still in the ‘Green Zone’. “Anyone wishing to come to Kodagu must agree to stay quarantined for 14 days,” he said.
