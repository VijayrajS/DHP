Tirupati: The central public health team on a visit to Kurnool district on Sunday reviewed the outbreak of the virus in the district and appreciated the efforts of the state government in containing the disease in parts of Andhra Pradesh.

At the review held in the district collectorate, collector G Veerapandian and other officials briefed the two-member team comprising Dr Madhumita Dubey, director at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health and Dr Sanjay Sadhukhan on containment measures taken by the administration. Dr Dubey said the state government has surpassed many other states in terms of screening and in containing the outbreak in parts of the state.

“We have come here to advise the Andhra Pradesh state government as well as the Kurnool district administration on more effective measures to be taken to flatten the Covid-19 curve in Kurnool district which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the state. We will thoroughly study the scenario in the district and help the Kurnool district administration with foolproof strategies to contain the virus spread,” Dr Dubey said.

Dr Sadhukhan said the lockdown will eventually have to be lifted and people will have to learn to live with the virus, while adhering to health and hygiene protocols.
