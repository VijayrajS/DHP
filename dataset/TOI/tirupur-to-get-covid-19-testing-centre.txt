TIRUPUR: State animal husbandry minister Udumalai K Radhakrishnan said that Tirupur would get a Covid-19 testing centre in a couple of days. 

Radhakrishnan, who chaired a meeting with industrialists in Tirupur on Tuesday, said that the centre would be equipped to test more than 200 samples a day. Till now, swab samples of people collected in Tirupur are being sent to the labs in Coimbatore or Chennai to get tested for Covid 19. The announcement has come at a time when Tirupur garment units are all set to open and scores of workers would be visiting every unit daily. 

Radhakrishnan said that the reopening of the garment units had come as a relief to the industrialists as well as workers who were struggling without a livelihood ever since the lockdown kicked in. He said that a committee would be put in place to look into the issues faced by the garment sector. The industrialists can approach the committee with their grievances, he said. 

He advised the apparel units to strictly follow the guidlines with regard to social distancing at workplace.
