Jaipur: The state government’s Covid helpline 181 registered over 2 lakh grievances during the first three phases of the lockdown. 

In order to assist people, the government had designated its Raj Sampark number ‘181’ as the Covid helpline. After the lockdown was imposed (from March 24 till May 18), the department registered 2,16,702 grievances. Of them, 2,04,321 have been disposed of, mostly in less than 48 hours, claim officials. 

Other than grievances, the helpline also received numerous calls for information. Around 30,986 calls were received daily on an average during the first three phases of lockdown. 

As the state entered the fourth phase of lockdown, on May 18 the helpline received more than 58,000 calls. The helpline has served as a useful platform for most citizens to reach the government even as they were unable to do so through the routine process. 

Interestingly, the grievances registered were not of routine nature. Some callers sought transport, some demanded medicine while there were also those who wanted food. All these and many other requests required immediate action and the helpline served its purpose.
