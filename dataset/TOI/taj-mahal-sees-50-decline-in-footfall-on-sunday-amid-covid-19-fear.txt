2020-03-16
Agra: Ever since the outbreak of novel coronavirus, of which Agra reported eight positive cases – of total 13 in Uttar Pradesh, the number of tourists visiting the Taj Mahal has been continuously declining. Sunday witnessed a sharp fall of 50% in the sale of tickets, as compared to normal weekends. The numbers may fall further in coming days due to restrictions on travel visas imposed by India along with shutdown by governments in various states across the country, said officials.According to data provided by the Archaeological Survey of India, the overall number of tourists has been declining for the past few days. A total of 16,428 visited the Taj Mahal on Thursday and 15,313 on Saturday. On Sunday, the numbers fell further to 13,186, as compared to the usual weekend sales of over 25,000 tickets.The number of foreign tourists fell down to a mere 1,274 on Sunday.Just 2,091 and 3,455 foreign tourists had visited the Mughal-era monument on Thursday and Saturday. The monument remains closed on Fridays.When contacted, ASI superintending archeologist (Agra circle), Vasant Swarnkar expressed apprehension that these numbers would fall further as people are avoiding to visit places of mass gatherings.Last Sunday, only 12,304 tickets were sold, but that was due to the fact that women’s entry to the monument was made free on the International Women’s Day. An estimated 10,000-plus women had visited the monument on March 8, said an ASI official.Agra Tourism Guild vice-president Rajiv Saxena said, “It’s sad to see the numbers of tourists declining at the Taj each passing day. But we hope the government’s efforts to arrest the outbreak of the Covid-19 succeed and tourists are back in Agra soon.”
