Vijayawada: Ragpickers left in the lurch due to lockdown
2020-04-23
VIJAYAWADA: Ragpickers who live on the outskirts of the city have been badly impacted by the lockdown. All 750 families of identified ragpickers have been facing problems after the city was declared a red zone. The IAS Officers Wives Association (IASOWA) extended their support to them, with the help of a voluntary organisation, and donated necessary groceries.


Ragpickers are dependent on the daily collection of plastic waste on the street. Movement on streets is restricted after the lockdown came into force. To add to their misery, all scrap buyers closed their stores. Rag pickers have lost their livelihood and are waiting for support from the government. 

Dalit Bahujan Resource Centre (DBRC), which is working on the welfare of the rag pickers, spoke to Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh on the issues faced by the ragpickers in the city. In response, Prasanna Venkatesh and his wife Manasa Venkatesh—with the help of IASOWA and CREDAI—donated grocery kits to all families of ragpickers. Each kit contains five kilograms rice, one kilogram of toor dal, sugar, two kilograms wheat flour and one litre cooking oil. Members of an NGO distributed the kits to rag pickers.

“Ragpickers are among the most neglected sections of the society. We are happy that IASOWA and the VMC commissioner responded to their problems,” said G Jhansi Rani, city coordinator of DBRC.
