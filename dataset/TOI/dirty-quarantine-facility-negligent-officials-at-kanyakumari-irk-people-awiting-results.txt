Dirty quarantine facility, negligent officials at Kanyakumari irk people awiting results
2020-05-28
Kanyakumari: The government may sound stern on quarantine protocols for people travelling amid the lockdown, but the ground reality is different.

A TOI photographer, who travelled from Chennai to Kanyakumari and had to stop at a check post at Kavalkinaru in Kanyakumari district at 6.30am on Wednesday, witnessed the negligence of government officials and of those working in a lodge that has been turned into a quarantine centre.

At the check post, a team of health, police and revenue officials collected details from travellers. But instead of sending them to the quarantine facility 25km away in Kanyakumari, the officials waited for another 20 vehicles to arrive. The logic, perhaps, was to collectively escort the vehicles to the centre.

But amid this, a driver who had returned from Chennai was allowed to go home after he said that he “did not get down anywhere in Chennai”. His samples were not collected either.

A group from Kanyakumari that had flown down from Abu Dhabi to Thiruvananthapuram on Monday night was not screened at the Kaliyakkavilai check post that falls on the way when one enters Kanyakumari from Kerala. They had to travel more than 55km by road from Kaliyakkavilai to Kavalkinaru, traversing the district, and get screened.

At the lodge, a traveller objected standing next to the group that had returned from Abu Dhabi. “But you are also from such a (Covid-19 infected) place! We are also standing here,” snapped a government official.

Another one denied chairs to an elderly couple, in their 70s, who could not stand in the queue for long.

When the officials began allotting rooms, the TOI photographer was asked to share it with another man who had travelled from Chengalpet. The argument ended when he was given a separate room.

If getting a room after a long travel was a 30-minute wait, the soiled bed without a bedspread was a put-off. Making matters worse, the hotel staff refused to enter the room and said they would not provide bedcovers or a fresh pillow cover.

The toilet was not flushed and there was no soap in the bathroom. (That the government has mandated frequent handwashing made little difference.)

Weary travellers had to pay for essentials sold at the hotel including drinking water. Some bought towels at Rs 70 apiece to use it as bedspread. Food had to be collected in a semi-buffet type arrangement made on unclean tables. Social distancing was not on the menu either.

Kanyakumari collector Prashant M Wadnere said the complaints would be “seriously looked into and instructions would be given to government officials and staff at the quarantine facilities to ensure cleanliness and social distancing”. Soon after, officials checked the rooms, cleaned them and provided bed sheets and other amenities.

On bringing international passengers entering Kanyakumari from Kerala to the check post at the border with Tirunelveli district, the collector said: “There is a screening and quarantine facility at Kaliyakkavilai for those flying to Thiruvananthapuram and heading to Kanyakumari by road. But when the number of travellers is high, a few travellers are brought to Kavalkinaru which is the only other district screening facility.”

Domestic travellers who are being screened and put up at the hotel will have to wait for a day to get the test results. If negative, they are free to go home.
