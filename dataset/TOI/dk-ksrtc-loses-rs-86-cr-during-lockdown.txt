Mangaluru: The Mangaluru and Puttur divisions of KSRTC have suffered losses to the tune of Rs 86 crore in revenue during April and May due to lockdown.

While the Mangaluru division lost Rs 54 crore in those two months, the Puttur division lost about Rs 32 crore. Mangaluru division is yet to get Rs 2.3 crore from the government as payment for ferrying migrant labourers to different destinations. At present, the Mangaluru division runs an average of 100 buses per day as per the safety guidelines of the government. Meanwhile, Puttur division operates 70 buses per day. 

KSRTC Puttur divisional controller Nagendra told STOI that the division has not yet calculated the actual loss of profit. However, he said the division has lost Rs 32 crore in terms of its collection in two months. “We still have confusion over the calculation of loss. We have to consider many factors before calculating it. The average monthly turnover of our division is Rs 16 crore. Hence, the loss in terms of business for two months is approximately Rs 32 crore,” Nagendra said.

The division was operating nearly 560 buses everyday prior to the lockdown. However, the number reduced to 60-70 after the lockdown was eased, he said, adding that the division may resume night services on Monday. 

KSRTC Mangaluru divisional controller S N Aruna said the division has been operating 90-110 buses everyday after the lockdown was eased. “Prior to lockdown, our division was operating about 545 buses everyday. It is only 90-110 now. We have resumed the night services on long-distance routes like Bengaluru, Mysuru, Belagavi and Ballari at 7pm. Similarly, Sarige buses are also plying on distant routes,” he added.
