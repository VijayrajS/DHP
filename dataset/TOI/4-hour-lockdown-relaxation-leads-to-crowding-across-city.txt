2020-05-05
AURANGABAD: The four-hour relaxation, from 7am to 11am, given once in two days by the district administration for buying and selling of essential commodities and services led to hordes of people coming out on streets on Monday.

Owing to this vegetable markets, grocery stores, flour mills and banks witnessed heavy rush. Meanwhile, in areas that are not connected by water pipeline people were seen getting their water stock full.

City police had issued a notification on May 1 about the lockdown restrictions and relaxations until May 17. The notification stated that all shops and establishments except medical stores and hospitals will be shut in the city on all odd dates â€” May 3, 5, 7, 9 and so on. 

The notification, however, stated that on all even dates until May 17 i.e. May 2, 4, 6, 8 and so on, the purchase of essential commodities will be allowed from 7 am to 11 am. 

The shutdown was observed religiously across the city on Sunday. However, the entire purpose of lockdown r was defeated as people rushed to markets and shops to get essentials. Subsequently, social distancing norm also went for a toss in these areas. 

According to Priyanand Agle, a social worker and student of disaster management, the odd-even formula cannot work during lockdown. "If shops selling essential commodities are open regularly then the rush can be reduced," he said.

Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Meena Makwana said that before the odd-even plan was implemented people were moving on roads throughout the day. "Crowding witnessed on Monday morning was concerning. People will have to cooperate by making their grocery and vegetable purchases at once for at least a week," she said, adding that the notification has not been changed and it will continue to remain effective for the forthcoming days.
