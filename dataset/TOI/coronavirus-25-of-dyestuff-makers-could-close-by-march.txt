2020-02-08
AHMEDABAD: Delayed shipments from China and a spike in raw material prices are threatening the dyes and dyestuff industry in Gujarat. Disruption in raw material supply from China could lead to 25% of dyestuff making units in the state closing, industry players fear. Gujarat is home to more than 600 dyestuff manufacturing units.


Local dyestuff units are heavily dependant on imports of several raw materials, including chemicals and intermediates, from China and supply has been hit due to shipments being stuck owing to the coronavirus scare.

“Shipments from China have not arrived and the same chemicals available from Indian players are exorbitantly priced.If this situation continues much longer, 25% of dyestuff manufacturing units here will be forced to shut down,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA.

Over the past fortnight, the prices of several chemicals used as raw material in the manufacture of dyes have nearly doubled, according to GDMA estimates. For example, the price of H-Acid has gone from Rs 350 per kg to Rs 550 per kg. For certain other chemicals, prices have nearly doubled.

“Prices of several raw materials that come from China including J-Acid and Tobias acid, have increased by 35%. At the same time, their prices in the Indian market have risen by 15%,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Chemical Export Promotion Council (Chemexil), Gujarat region.

“The Chinese government extended its New Year vacation to February 10. However, even if business resumes, there are concerns that factories may not be given permission to continue manufacturing. Due to this, the domestic industry in Gujarat and India could be be affected,” said Patel,
