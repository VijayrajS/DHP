2020-06-08
Bicholim: In view of the rising novel coronavirus cases in the state, the Bicholim Municipal Council (BMC) is planning to extend the lockdown.

BMC chairperson Rajaram Gaonkar convened an emergency meeting of the councillors and BMC chief officer Vivek Naik, on Saturday, especially after cases were reported in neighbouring Sattari.

Gaonkar said they will meet chief minister Pramod Sawant and demand a “strict lockdown in areas where Covid-19 cases are increasing”.

He said that a lockdown is necessary in Bicholim as people are not following the prescribed norms.

Gaonkar appealed to the people not to come to the market unnecessarily and to wear masks when moving out of their residences.
