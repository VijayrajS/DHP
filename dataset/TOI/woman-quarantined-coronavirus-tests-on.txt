2020-01-30
GHAZIABAD: A 27-year-old woman who returned from China recently has been put on quarantine by the health department, which has sent her samples to be tested for the Wuhan coronavirus.

The woman is a resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi but was quarantined by a Ghaziabad health department team that tracked her down to a house in Indirapuram where she had gone to meet a friend. People who have recently returned from China are all being tracked to see if they have any symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus, whose outbreak in the eponymous Chinese city has triggered a global health scare.

Officials said the woman had returned to India from China on January 20. She visited Indirapuram to meet a friend on Tuesday. Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad, said he was informed of the woman’s visit by the health department in Lucknow following which a quick response team was rushed to the flat where she was staying. She was not taken to hospital but quarantined in the apartment “as a precautionary measure” as test reports are awaited.

“She complained of body ache and also had fever. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we decided to put her in quarantine at the flat itself and sent her test samples to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital in Delhi,” Gupta said, adding her condition was being monitored round the clock by the health department’s quick response team that was stationed at the flat.

At least three other persons, including a 24-year-old student who returned from China recently, are quarantined at RML hospital for suspected coronavirus infection. All of them have cold, cough and fever. Hospital authorities said their test samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the results are awaited.

Like seasonal influenza, which is quite common these days, coronavirus infection also spreads from an infected person to others through air, by coughing and sneezing or through close personal contact.

The disease has spread to at least 15 countries, including the US, Japan, Thailand, Singapore and Nepal. In India, no positive case has been reported so far but the government is on high alert and multiple ministries are meeting regularly to chalk out strategies to prevent the spread of the disease and prepare a roadmap to deal with any crisis.

The Wuhan illness, as the coronavirus infection is being described, is of the same family that caused MERS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infections, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to 26 countries.
