Rajasthan: TB detection machines to test patients for coronavirus
2020-04-29
JAIPUR: To test Covid-19 patients, the state government will use CB-NAAT machines meant for detecting tuberculosis.

According to medical and health minister Raghu Sharma, the machines will come up with the results within an hour which will help the government identify Covid-19 patients faster. He said these machines are being set up at four medical colleges in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Bikaner. 

Sharma said 8 CB-NAAT machines were being transferred from different districts to four medical colleges — SMS State Medical College Jaipur, SN Medical College Jodhpur, PBM Hospital Bikaner and New Medical College Kota — to deal with the pandemic and to get quick investigation reports. 

He said the diagnostic machines used to test drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) have now been approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting Covid-19 tests. 

This machine can check a maximum of four samples at a time. This investigation of Covid-19 is based on the RT-PCR Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction method. The minister informed that one-month medicine will be provided to all TB patients (private and government) residing in the state to help them in overcoming the inconvenience caused to them due to Covid-19. Medicines for TB patients will be made available even if they are not registered in the TB programme. Patients taking TB treatment in any state in the country and currently living in the state could also avail this benefit, he said. 

ACS medical and health Rohit Kumar Singh said, “These machines will come handy in emergency situations, like for instance an emergency operation when you need the result fast. He said the limitation of these machines is you could do only four tests at a time.” 

State tuberculosis control programme officer Dr Vinod Kumar Garg said the machines were being transferred on the directions of the Centre.
