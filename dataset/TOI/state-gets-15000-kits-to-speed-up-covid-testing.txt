Uttar Pradesh gets 15,000 kits to speed up Covid-19 testing
2020-04-11
LUCKNOW: At a time when testing is being considered as the arsenal to combat coronavirus, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has provided 15,000 testing kits to Uttar Pradesh after an arrangement between NITI Aayog, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Temasek Foundation.


BMGF has also provided 15,000 kits to Bihar.

Replying to a TOI query, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said: “ICMR has validated the kits which are ‘all-in-one’ RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction) test kit for detection of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2-RNA) through the use of upper and lower respiratory samples.”

This means that the kit comes with all necessary reagents to undertake the test.

“Manufactured by Singapore-based company, Accelerate Tech, the kit has received provisional authorization for clinical use from Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The kits will help in building testing capacity in states,” Kant said. Secretary, UP health department, Hekali Zhimomi said: “The state government received 30,000 kits which included 15,000 for Bihar. Those meant for Bihar have already been dispatched.”

After receiving the kits, principal secretary, health and family welfare (Bihar) Sanjay Kumar wrote on his twitter handle: “Our sincere thanks to BMGF for providing the state 15,000 testing kits for Covid-19. It shall be made available to our labs on requirement.”

In-charge of infectious disease unit at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) Dr D Himanshu said: “Though 15,000 may not appear to be a huge number considering that UP is undertaking 1,200-odd tests a day but their availability at this crucial time will help in understanding the progression of the disease and plan for future management.” Data on increasing cases support Dr Himanshu’s logic. In UP, the total number of cases in UP reached 431 on Friday (at 4 pm) against just 116 on April 1.
