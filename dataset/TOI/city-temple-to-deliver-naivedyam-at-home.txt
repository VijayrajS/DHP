Covid-19 scare: Patna temple to deliver ‘naivedyam’ at home
2020-03-21
PATNA: The administration of Mahavir Mandir near Patna Junction has taken measures to reduce the number of devotees at the temple in view of the coronavirus threat. It has decided to deliver ‘naivedyam prasad’ at home for the devotees of Patna only, who place their orders online, Mahavir Mandir Trust secretary Kishore Kunal said on Friday.


Kunal said Tirupati and Jagannath Temple at Puri are pilgrims’ places, but devotees visit Mahavir Mandir here in large numbers on special days and that’s why the temple administration is not in a position to shut it, for now. He urged the devotees to restrain themselves from visiting the temple and, instead, have darshan of ‘Hanuman ji’ online through mobile app between 5am and 11pm.

For different kinds of puja like ‘janm manglanushthan’, the temple administration is making arrangements to send priests to the homes of interested devotees, he added.

The temple administration has already started thermal screening of devotees. Arrangements have also been made for hand sanitizers on the temple premises, Kunal said.
