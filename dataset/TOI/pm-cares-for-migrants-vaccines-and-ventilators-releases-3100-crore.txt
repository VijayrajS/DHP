NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday said it would release Rs 3,100 crore from the PM CARES Fund to help migrants workers, for purchase of ventilators and support vaccine development for coronavirus. 


Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thanked all donors for generous contributions to support India’s fight against the pandemic. 

The opposition has been alleging lack of transparency in the fund which was set up in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The Trust is headed by the PM with ministers of home, defence, and finance as members. 

A government statement said of the total amount to be released, Rs 2,000 crore will be used to purchase 50,000 ‘Made in India’ ventilators to augment healthcare infrastructure; Rs 1,000 crore will be handed over to state governments to provide accommodation, food, medical treatment and transport arrangements for migrant labourers, the worst sufferers of the lockdown; and the rest Rs 100 crore to catalyse vaccine development for Covid-19 and will be utilised under the supervision of the principal scientific advisor to the PM. 

The government also said that states will receive funds in proportion to their population as per 2011 Census, and the incidence of corona cases. An equal share of 10% will also be given to all states and UTs to ensure a basic minimum sum for all states. The funds will be relea- sed to district collectors thro- ugh state’s disaster relief commissioners, the statement said.
