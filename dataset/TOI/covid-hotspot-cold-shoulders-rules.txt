Surat: A video of a crowded market in Limbayat area of the city went viral on social media on Sunday. Hundreds of people can be seen in the video, probably of Saturday, making purchases near Madina mosque for Ramzan. No action was taken by police against people for violation of social distancing norms in the market during lockdown. However, after the video went viral on social media, police registered an offence and arrested seven people. Limbayat zone of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has reported a large number of positive cases of Covid-19. 

In another offence, police arrested four persons from near Madina mosque on Sunday for gathering there without any valid reason. Police sources said some local leaders were told by government officers that the market near Madina mosque has been permitted to remain open during Ramzan from 5pm to 7pm. However, no permission was officially given by any government officer.

"A senior government officer had allowed 10 to 15 vegetable and fruit vendors to do business in the market for two hours daily in the evening. Unfortunately, over 400 vendors reached the market on Saturday due to which there was chaos and the gathering was disallowed," said a community leader of Limbayat.

On Sunday, the market functioned in a narrow lane near Madina mosque. Huge crowd gathered in the area which was chock-a-block with about 50 vendors of vegetables, fruits and other products. 

"People are coming out to shop for food items for Ramzan. There is no prohibitory order on vegetables and fruit shops, but the issue is social distancing is not being maintained,‚Äù said M V Makwana, police inspector, Limbayat police station.

"We have registered two offences for crowding around Madina mosque and arrested 11 people. Police will take strict action to ensure that social distancing is maintained," Makwana added.
