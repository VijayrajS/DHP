Chicken prices drop over false virus scare in Mumbai
2020-02-27
MUMBAI: India may be insulated from the spread of coronavirus, but the myths and fears surrounding the disease are taking a toll. A few people are shying away from consuming chicken, causing prices to drop by 20%, though there is no established link between the disease and chicken 

Across Bandra, Kurla, Andheri and Chembur, poultry shops reported that fear of the virus is driving down sales, forcing them to reduce rates. In Bandra, a family that bought chicken legs for Rs 200/kg not so long ago, purchased for Rs 160 on Monday.

The owner of Aziz Broiler in Bandra said poultry farmers are suffering losses by disposing of birds at a 20% lower rate. Another shop Yaadgaar has dropped retail prices 'marginally' to Rs 90 per kg to lure consumers. Abdul Hafeez Qureshi, who owns Mumbai Mutton and Chicken Shop in Goregaon, said: "Even the WHO has not hinted at any link between the outbreak of coronavirus and chicken. Yet people are affected by baseless forwards on social media."
