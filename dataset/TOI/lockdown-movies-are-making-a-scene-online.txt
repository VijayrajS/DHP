A cast of one per scene (physical distancing protocol in place), actors in masks (pandemic measures taken), the house as a shooting spot (isolation rules followed)… lockdown-hero, budget-zero movies are taking the internet by storm as filmmaking enthusiasts get together (while apart of course) to create short films, often with a message.
