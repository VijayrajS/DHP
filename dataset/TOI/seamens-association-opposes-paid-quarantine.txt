Panaji: The Goan seamen association of India has objected to the state government introducing paid quarantine facilities at the cost of the seafarers or shipping companies.

In a letter to the CM and other government officials on Wednesday, president of the association Frank Viegas asked the government to rethink its decision considering the financial situation of the seafarers and their employers due to the pandemic.

Forcing companies to pay for the quarantine facilities of their crew could have consequences for their future assignments, where they can refuse to hire them, he stated. 

“Showing no empathy to the Goan community and charging their own people, will have a ripple effect which can be avoided by showing kind and selfless aid. Hope the government of Goa will rethink its decision on paid quarantine,” Viegas stated.

The association met with ports secretary and officials from the NRI commission on Tuesday. Talking to reporters after the meeting, Viegas said no other state is talking of paid quarantine. 

Founder of the association Dixon Vaz said paid quarantine would run into crores of rupees, which should not be extracted from companies. Viegas said no company will hire crew again after being forced to pay for quarantine facilities. “The CM is saying agents and the company are paying but we don’t know whether they are paying willingly. How will companies agree to pay for crew only in Goa? There is a hidden agenda,” he said.
