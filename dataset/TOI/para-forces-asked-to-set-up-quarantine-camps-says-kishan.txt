Hyderabad: Union minister of state for home affairs, Kishan Reddy, on Sunday announced that all paramilitary forces, including the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Border Security Force (BSF), and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have been told to set up quarantine camps for coronavirus suspects as a preparatory measure.

Interacting with the media, he said the Indian government has responded quickly on the spread of the virus, and crucial announcements on precautionary measures may be announced on Monday. The minister said that currently, the ITBP is operating a quarantine camp, which can house about 500 people near Delhi. Two batches of people have been released from these camps so far.

He said the Union government has identified certain places for the camps and they are ready. They can accommodate any number of people as being directed by the health ministry, the nodal agency for coronavirus. The central health ministry is reviewing and directing state governments on the virus and measures to be taken, he said. 

The minister expressed confidence that India is handling the situation well, and there is no need for any panic. “Our country shares a large border with China, the epicentre of coronavirus. Since we have been very alert, the presence of virus in the country is very less,” Reddy said.

Explaining the measures taken by the Centre, he said Indians stranded in Italy faced problems as the country was not allowing them to board the flights. “Even after the Indian government sent medical teams with equipment, they were not allowed to take the samples. The central government pursued the issue with embassy officials, and the samples have now been taken, and will be tested at NIV, Pune,” he said. 

The Centre is sending medical teams to other countries where Indians are stranded, and tests will be conducted. Arrangements are being made to get them back, he said.
