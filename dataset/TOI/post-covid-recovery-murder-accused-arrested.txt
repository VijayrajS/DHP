VADODARA: Four murder accused who were being treated for Covid-19 after they had tested positive for the virus were arrested from SSG Hospital on Sunday.

Accused Rahul Vasava, Deepak Pawar, Ajay Pawar and Manish Vasava were discharged from the hospital after recovery and were soon arrested by Bapod police on charges of thrashing Sujal Parmar, a resident of Ajwa Road, on May 25, leading to his death subsequently.

“The deceased had suffered grievous injuries as the four accused thrashed him with baseball bats and iron rods. Three days after he was admitted at the SSG Hospital, he succumbed to his injuries, following which all four were booked for murder,” a police official said.

After Rahul and the three others were detained and tested for Covid-19, all proved to be positive, a section of Bapod police station staff also have to undergo home quarantine. “We will now interrogate them about the murder weapons and reconstruct the crime,” the official added.
