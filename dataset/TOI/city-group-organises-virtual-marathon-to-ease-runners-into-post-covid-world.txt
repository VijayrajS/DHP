CHENNAI: Want to run a marathon as a team but keep a safe distance with Covid on your mind? Here’s a chance. Valasai Venghais, a city-based runners’ group, is organising a post-Covid international awareness run on June 13 to 14. A team of seven can come together to cover the 42.2km from different locations, time. 

The idea of the team marathon is to create awareness among people about a post-Covid world, where things are going to change. “People are used to group running but now things are bound to change. Life is not going to be as fast as before since some restrictions will remain. In this crucial juncture, we should know how to adapt. We are trying to tell people how we can live better as a team through this team marathon,” said C N Paul Pradeep, organiser of the event. 

Participants can run on a treadmill, inside rooms, terrace or the outdoors. Since this is a social distancing run, members should keep a minimum 4ft distance if they are running outdoors. Each runner of the team must run 6km (6×7=42km) finishing the marathon, for the team to be eligible to enter the leaderboard.

Once the registration is done, each team will be asked to prepare an awareness video on the safety aspects adopted, including the importance of social distancing in the time of Covid-19. 

The team marathon will begin at 12.00am on June 13 and go on till the 12 noon on June 14. “We have given a total 36 hours for the teams so participants can run slow and steady, support each other as a team and work together to complete the race,” Pradeep said. 

Members can run at their own convenience during the given time span but must use a GPS-based workout tracking app. Participants must share the link after the run. An e-certificate with the importance of team-work during the time of Covid-19 will be issued to the winners. Log on to
