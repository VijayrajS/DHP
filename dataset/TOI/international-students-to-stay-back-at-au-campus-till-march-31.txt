2020-03-20
VISAKHAPATNAM: Following the state government announcing holidays for all educational institutions till March 31, Andhra University (AU) has decided to hold back nearly 500 international students on the campus. 

The decision was taken in view of the spread of coronavirus in more than 40 countries, ongoing travel restrictions and finances involved in the jaunt. Besides, it may become difficult for the students to return to India if they were to return home.

Meanwhile, in a circular issued on Wednesday night, AU asked other students and research scholars to make arrangements to return home. The varsityâ€™s colleges, hostels, library (including reading room), and all other offices/unit will remain closed till March 31, as per the state government order.

Students, research scholars, teaching and non-teaching staff of the varsity have been advised to stay home and observe precautionary measures during this period to contain the spread of COVID-19. 

An AU official said they cannot send the students back to their home countries for the next 15 days as nearly 100 countries are battling the pandemic and due to travel restrictions. 

AU is also considering holding the international students back even during the summer holidays. 

The varsity has nearly 500 international students from about 40 countries, staying in four different hostels. 

All the international students of the varsity have medical insurance.
