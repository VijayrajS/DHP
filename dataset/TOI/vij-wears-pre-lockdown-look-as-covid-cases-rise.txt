Vijayawada wears pre-lockdown look as Covid-19 cases rise
2020-06-07
VIJAYAWADA: Traffic snarls have increased across major junctions in the city, such as Mahatma Gandhi Road, Eluru Road, Benz Circle and Gurunanak Junction in the last five days, despite rising number of Covid-19 cases in the state. The scene at areas such as One Town, Panja Center, Governorpet, and other densely-populated business hubs has returned to their pre-lockdown times. 


On Saturday, city police had to deploy additional forces to manage traffic congestion on the main roads and used loudspeakers at junctions to request motorists to maintain safe distance. 

Meanwhile, Krishna district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz continued to appeal to the public to not come out of their homes unless it is necessary. “One should take care of themselves and their families to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Cases are increasing in the city and one should follow necessary precautions. As per the directions of the government, we are further relaxing the rules of lockdown. All shopping malls, restaurants, temples, and religious centres will reopen from Monday,” Imtiaz said. 

One should wear masks and gloves and maintain social distancing while moving on streets, he said. Section 144 will be in force from 9 pm to 5 am, Imtiaz added.
