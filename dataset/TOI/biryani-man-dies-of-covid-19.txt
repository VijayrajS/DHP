2020-04-27
GUNTUR: The report of the test results for Subhani, the ‘biryani man’ of Guntur, who died on Saturday evening and whose body was kept in the mortuary, came back positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. The 52-year-old was rushed to Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur on Friday night after he complained of having trouble breathing. Subhani also had liver and heart ailments.


 Subhani was advised to stay a quarantine facility after two of his neighbours tested positive for Covid-19 last week. 

A daily wage earner, Subhani started his hotel two decades ago that used to serve a khichdi-kebab breakfast to masons and other daily wage workers in the local chilli yard for just Rs 30. His business later turned into a biryani hotel. -Samdani MN
