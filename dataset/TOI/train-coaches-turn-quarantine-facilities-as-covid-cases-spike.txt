Vijayawada: As the number of Covid cases continue to rise in the state, the Railways has joined the battle against Covid-19. While the Vijayawada railway division has set up nine quarantine centres with a total of 160-bed capacity across its jurisdiction, 100 sleeper coaches were converted into quarantine facilities at Tirupati railway station.

The quarantine centres in the Vijayawada railway division has been set up across Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, Gudur, Bitragunta, Bhimavaram, Tenali, Eluru and Kakinada. All of them are being disinfected regularly.

Besides, taking Kerala as a precedent, officials explained that they have begun collecting swab samples from its 18,000-staff to detect Covid-19 cases. Railway Hospital in the city has come up with a unique way of collecting the throat swab samples from suspected patients. The window in the ENT clinic has been fitted with two gloves. The doctor behind the pane can put his hand inside the glove and collect the swab, thus staying protected. 

Speaking on the occasion, assistant chief medical superintendent of railway hospital Naseer Hussain said employees with health issues, fever and recent history of foreign visits are being regularly monitored on a daily basis.

 “Isolation wards and quarantine facilities are being strictly monitored and frequent disinfection is being carried out to curtail the spread”, he said.

Meanwhile, in Tirupati nearly 100 sleeper coaches have been converted into quarantine facilities. 

“Each coach can accommodate nine patients and has sufficient beds and other necessary medical infrastructure to treat Covid-19 patients/suspects. In each coach, middle berths were removed and all the windows were covered with mosquito nets, while the entrance of each cabin was covered with two half plastic curtains”, Tirupati railway station director Nagaramana Sarma said.
