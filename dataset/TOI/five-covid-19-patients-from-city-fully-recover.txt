GURUGRAM: Five of the city’s 10 Covid-19 patients have fully recovered, the health department said on Saturday.

“Five of the patients have completely recovered. This is the most positive bit of news in many weeks now. Also, we have not had a fresh case in the last four days, which is a good sign as well,” chief medical officer JS Puniya said.

Among those who have recovered is a 29-year-old woman who lives in Sector 9A. 
 
 
She had returned from Malaysia and was admitted to a private hospital in the city on March 16 after she tested positive for Covid-19. After 12 days of treatment, her tests were clear.

Similarly, a 44-year-old man who had returned from London was admitted to Safdarjung hospital on March 17. He is a resident of Sector 50 in Gurugram. His 40-year-old wife was also found to be Covid-19 positive and admitted to the same hospital on March 19. The health department said the couple has fully recovered.

The two other patients who have recovered are two siblings in Palam Vihar. The sister – a 22-year-old student at a university in London -- tested positive on March 18 and was admitted to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10. Her 16-year-old brother tested positive and was admitted to hospital on March 21.
