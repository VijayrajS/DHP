Coast Guard ready to discharge duties in times of pandemic
2020-05-10
MANGALURU: The Indian Coast Guard has a dual fight on its hands. On the one hand, it has to fight an unseen enemy who strives to undermine national sovereignty from beyond the seas, and on the other, it has to combat an enemy within, that is microscopically tiny and has brought humankind on its knees, literally. It is a combination of perseverance and following military discipline, that is helping the Coast Guard keep both these enemies at bay.

Fathom this. The 500-odd officers, men, and civilians under the command of the Indian Coast Guard district headquarters (DHQ) 3 at Panambur, form the front line of the nation’s defence, for all the threats that could emanate from the sea, especially post the 26/11 terrorist attacks at Mumbai. With the Coast Guard tasked with this onerous task, the focus is on ensuring that every person vested with this responsibility is physically fit and free of Covid-19, says DIG S B Venkatesh, commander, Coast Guard, Karnataka.

This heightened level of precaution is an absolute must in these testing times, when several front-line Covid-19 warriors, including police personnel, and men in the Central Armed Police Force, have tested positive for the disease, said Venkatesh. “Every officer, personnel performing administrative duties, sailing and flying duty, must be medically fit. If one of my personnel has even the slightest of sniffles, they are not allowed on active duty till cleared by the unit medical officer,” he said.

In addition, the officers are required to maintain the highest level of personal hygiene at their place of work and residence. They are provided transport facilities, and social distancing is maintained at the workplace, he says. To ensure they stay physically fit for demanding flying and sailing duties, there is a proper fitness regimen that they are expected to follow, he said.
