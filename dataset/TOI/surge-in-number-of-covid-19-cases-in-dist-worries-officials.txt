2020-06-12
KANPUR: The rise in coronavirus positive cases in the first ten days of June has worried the district authorities who are discussing to find ways to control the pandemic.

In the last ten days, the city has recorded 240 cases, of them 11 persons have died. The pandemic has proved all predictions wrong as the virus is spreading in old areas. Divisional commissioner Sudhir M Bobde, at a review meeting held on Wednesday had also expressed concern over a spike in the number of corona positive cases.

He directed the officials to pay more attention to private labs and insurance companies as most of the reports of private labs were found positive. He has issued an alert to the officials that due to a surge in the number of cases, it might become necessary to increase the number of hospitals and beds in the coming days. He said that the 100-bedded level-one Narayana Hospital should now be converted into a 200-bedded hospital. If the number of patients increased, private hospitals could be taken over for their treatment, he said.

The district administration authorities had hoped that during summer season, spread of virus would be checked due to high temperature, but their hopes dashed as it is spreading in new areas. The situation was almost under control till the third week of May, but after the influx of migrant workers, it went out of control. According to some experts, the situation could become worse in monsoon as weather scientists have predicted normal rains. 

Meanwhile, DM Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari on Thursday made an appeal to the residents to follow the Covid-19 protocol and social distancing rules, use masks, avoid close contact with strangers and come out of home only if necessary.
