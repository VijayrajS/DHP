Tamil Nadu: A few districts bear brunt of more returnees testing coronavirus positive
2020-06-05
Return of Tamils, stuck across the country during the lockdown, to their native places over the past few weeks has resulted in a steep surge in Covid cases in several districts. While a few places like Chennai have higher number of indigenous cases, there are districts where ‘imported’ cases have overtaken local incidence of Covid-19.

Most of these districts are in southern Tamil Nadu, where hundreds from the rural hinterland go up north seeking better livelihood. These people started returning in droves once the lockdown restrictions were eased towards the third week of May, spiking Covid cases in their native districts. Some districts like Tirunelveli and Tuticorin are badly hit by the influx of workers. Tirunelveli, a backward district in south Tamil Nadu which is largely rural, has only 115 ‘indigenous’ Covid positive cases while reporting 266 imported cases comprising people who returned largely from Maharashtra.

Neighbouring coastal district of Tuticorin had 149 cases on May 23. In the next days it had more than doubled the Covid incidence with 301 cases on June 3, most of which were imported cases. Virudhunagar and Sivaganga districts in south TN too had more imported cases than indigenous cases as of June 3 while in the central TN it was Pudukottai, west Salem and north Kallakurichi districts to emulate this trend.

State health minister C Vijayabaskar said the influx of people from other states has emerged as the latest challenge in the battle against Covid 19 in Tamil Nadu. “However, we are testing each and every one returning to the state,” Vijayabaskar said. 

From May 14 when the Delhi – Chennai train entered the state, to June 1, Tamil Nadu has received 1.26 lakh people stranded in various parts of the country. A majority of them, close to 90,000, had reached the state through road either by own vehicles or buses. Though not all of them are migrant workers, government officials say 80% of them could be those working in other states like Maharashtra or Gujarat.

Of these returnees, about 1,740 such returnees have tested positive so far, most of whom are from rural pockets.

Though the returnees are tested at the district borders and hospitalized if found positive, there are instances where they test negative initially but develop symptoms later thus resulting in a spread.

J Nirmalson, deputy director of health, Salem district, says they have also come across instances where a person tests negative at the checkpost but during the follow up test after a week, they test positive. “When they test positive after a week, we consider them as indigenous cases,” he said.
