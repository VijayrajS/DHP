RPF Covid warriors sans defence
2020-05-30
Lucknow: Adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols improved a bit among Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel at Charbagh railway station on Friday, but Railway Protection Force (RPF) cops were found to be lacking in a TOI reality check.

About 245 GRP and 110 RPF personnel are deployed at Charbagh station. GRP manages law and order at railway stations, while RPF enforces law both on moving trains and at stations. So far, 10 railway cops— nine of GRP and one of RPF—deployed to manage migrants coming via Shramik trains have been diagnosed with Covid-19.

RPF senior commandant Abhishek Kumar said, “Two protective coveralls have been allocated for each train and 20 at the station. They are used when personnel enter passenger coaches or mingle with people for crowd management. Besides, each jawan deployed for other jobs at the station has been given three reusable masks, a hand sanitizer and soap. Initially, disposable hand gloves were also provided.”

However, TOI found that RPF personnel at the station were wearing only face masks. None had face shields and hand gloves as given to their GRP counterparts. They were also seen mingling with each other without following physical distancing. “The RPF constable found positive on Thursday was deployed at the station for crowd management, hence jawans need to take precautions all the time, be it on train or at a platform,” said a health officer. Kumar said that about 1,000 face shields and reusable hand gloves for entire Lucknow Division, which covers several railway stations, will be provided by next week.
