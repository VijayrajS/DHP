2020-04-03
VIJAYAWADA: With the state witnessing a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, Andhra Pradesh has got two more virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) in Guntur and Kadapa. 


While the Guntur one will become operational on Friday, the Kadapa VRDL will start functioning from Saturday after a quality test. 

The state government had already set up four 24x7 VRDLs in Tirupati, Vijayawada, Kakinada and Anantapur with a combined testing capacity of 450 samples a day. The two new laboratories will increase the capacity to 570 samples a day.

Meanwhile, the state government has placed an order for equipment required to set up one more laboratory in Visakhapatnam. Other than sending the first 10 samples for cross-checking, these special labs will give the results in about seven hours after receiving the samples. 

In a recent government order, the director of medical education was instructed to depute scientists, research assistants and lab technicians available in medical colleges where VRDLs are not available to these laboratories.

Meanwhile, special chief secretary (medical, health and family welfare) KS Jawahar Reddy on Thursday conducted a review meeting on the personal protective equipment (PPE) being provided to medical personnel treating Covid-19 patients.

He spoke to the suppliers of 90 GSM non-woven fabric, which is used for making the PPEs, and checked a few samples. He asked them to provide 2,500 PPEs on a daily basis to the four state-level Covid-19 hospitals besides supplying 1,000 PPEs to the district hospitals.
