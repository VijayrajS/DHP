PANAJI: On Friday, the state conducted 386 tests for Covid-19, and all samples tested negative. The DHS bulletin said that 181 contacts were placed in facility quarantine and five persons admitted to the isolation ward at GMC.

Persons having symptoms of Covid-19 are admitted in isolation ward of a hospital and released after their samples test negative for Covid-19, or once they recover.

Since May 1, there has been an increase in persons placed in facility quarantine as people stranded in other parts of the country have started returning home, including those who have second homes in the state and have chosen to travel here as it is a ‘green zone’.

 Normally, most remain in quarantine for two to three days until their tests reports are received, an official said.
