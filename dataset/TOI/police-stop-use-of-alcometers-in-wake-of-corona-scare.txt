DEHRADUN: In the wake of the scare triggered by coronavirus, police have stopped the use of alcometers to check for drunken drivers.


Deputy inspector general (DIG) and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dehradun Arun Mohan Joshi said, “With suspected cases of coronavirus on the rise in the state, we have stopped the use of alcometers to check for drunken driving. Instead, our personnel have been directed to collect urine or blood samples if they suspect a driver of being inebriated.” 

The SSP added that “several people have raised concerns about the possible spread of contiguous diseases through the use of alcometers, which are used to detect alcohol content in a breath sample which is the reason why its use has been stopped for now.” 

In addition, SP traffic has been directed to form a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), in consultation with medical practitioners and experts regarding the use of alcometers. 

Till the SOP is made, the SP traffic has also been asked to train the police personnel about the safe use of alcometers, informed police sources.
