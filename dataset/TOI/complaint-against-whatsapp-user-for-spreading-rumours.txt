PUNE: The Pune divisional commissioner on Sunday lodged a complaint with the Koregaon Park police against an unidentified WhatsApp user for sending several messages to the commissioner’s WhatsApp account, seeking closure of two city-based hotels for their guests and employees were suffering from Covid-19.


After receiving the messages, divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar deputed health as well as revenue department officials for verifying the information. The officials, upon inspecting the hotels, found that the information was false, following which Mhaisekar registered a complaint as government officials were made to run around needlessly, police said.

When contacted, Mhaiseker told TOI, “The district administration has warned social media group heads and rumour mongers against spreading false messages relating to Covid-19. Due action will be taken against such persons under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Act. The administration has already alerted the cybercrime police to keep a watch on WhatsApp group heads for spread of any such complaints.”

Senior inspector Pramod Patki of the Koregaon Park police said, “The divisional commissioner was at his residence when he received more than five messages on his Whatsapp account, asking him to take action against the hotels because its guests and employees were suffering from Covid-19. The commissioner found the information false after due verification.”

Patki said, “Based on the divisional commissioner’s complaint, we have registered an offence of giving false information under sections 182 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act against an unidentified person. We are trying to trace and establish the identity of the individual.”
