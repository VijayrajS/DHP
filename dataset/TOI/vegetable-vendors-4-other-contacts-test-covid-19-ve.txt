LUCKNOW: Four more contacts of the Lalbagh vegetable vendor were found positive for novel coronavirus infection on Tuesday, taking number of his contacts diagnosed with Covid-19 to 10.

The four cases were family members of a general store owner in Nazarbagh who was tested positive on May 3.

The vegetable vendor, who was diagnosed with the disease on April 25, was a regular visitor to the general store. His other contacts found positive include his two family members and two Kaiserbagh vegetable wholesalers among others.

“Swab samples of about 100 persons in Nazarbagh suspected to have come in contact with the vendor and the general store owner have been sent for tests,” said Dr KP Tripathi in charge of district infectious diseases control unit. The fifth case on Tuesday was of a 13-year-old girl from Macchali Mohal. It took city’s tally so far to 242.

The girl's case was traced after two elder brothers were stopped at Lucknow-Barabanki border on May 3 while they were going to visit their mother suffering from Covid-19 and under treatment in Barabanki. The duo said they and their sister had visited their mother earlier as well, following which officers decided to test all five family members living in Lucknow.

CMO Dr Narendra Agarwal said the girl’s report came on Tuesday.
