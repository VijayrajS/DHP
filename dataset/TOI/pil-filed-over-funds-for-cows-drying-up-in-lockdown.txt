Ahmedabad: A PIL in the Gujarat high court raised the issue of dried up funds for the panjarapols in the state after the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic and it sought directions to the state authorities to provide funds for upkeep of the cows.Since the issue raised in the PIL was caused because of the Covid-19 situation, the high court ordered that the PIL should be tagged with the court’s Suo Motu PIL with regard to lockdown and Covid-19. The petition for the bovines will now come up for hearing on June 19, said petitioner’s advocate Pratik Thakkar.Three petitioners including tow donors from Mumbai approached the HC submitting that the funds in the panjarapols across the state have dried up after the lockdown. There is a shortage of fodder for thousands of cows kept in these cattle pounds.The petitioners also highlighted the government police that it provides Rs 25/day for one month for a cow that it placed in panjarapol. It was contended that average expenditure per animal is nearly Rs 100/day and the amount that the authorities spend after an animal for a month is paltry. The PIL seeks direction to the government authorities including Gauseva and Gaucher Vikas Board to increase the funds for proper maintenance of animals in panjarapols.
