Kolhapur: Rampant violations of the lockdown have prompted villagers to adopt new measures to keep visitors away and prevent people from roaming around. 

As many as 15 villages from Kolhapur district have decided to observe complete lockdown in their respective villages for three to five days. All the services will be suspended during these days, except medical emergency services, said villagers.

Most of these villages conducted meetings of the sarpanch and other seniors and decided to implement the complete lockdown. The shutdown came into effect from Tuesday in some villages, while it would be implemented from April 1 in others.

Kagal town, one of the important marketplaces in the district, has decided to follow 48-hour complete shutdown for two days from March 31. The Kagal Municipal Council has issued notification in this regard to the residents on March 30.

Saravade village from Radhanagari taluka decided to observe complete shutdown for four days from March 31 to April 3.

Sachin Jathar, retail shop owner from Sarawade village, said that despite the lockdown, people were roaming the village for purchasing grocery and crowding at vegetable vendors. We support the decision of our grampanchayat and expect people will support it by staying at home.‚Äù
