Madurai: To observe ‘World Food Safety Day’ on June 7, dieticians, amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic this year, urged the public to follow safe practices of handling food and have a balanced diet to stay safe and healthy.

With restaurants being closed down during lockdown and fear over hygiene, the emphasis was back on home-cooked food. Dieticians urged for precautions and to continue having home-cooked food more, especially for children and elderly, even post lockdown. “During this pandemic, any boiled food is best for health. In this era, we had shifted to fast food and preferred it though it was not healthy. But, this time has shown the importance of home-cooked food. In our culture, idli is one of the healthiest and safest foods in terms of nutrition and method of preparation,” said Dr Jeyanthi, chief dietician, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC). 

Dieticians on the other hand also pointed out how food habits affect immunity and that a healthy diet is required to boost one’s immunity to protect against any disease. “These days, many children are avoiding food which contain garlic, onion, ginger but actually it boosts immunity,” explained Dr Jeyanthi.

Fears about eating meat during times of the pandemic were also dispelled. “There is no reason to believe Covid-19 spreads through eating meat. There is nothing to fear if we use proper cooking method . Meat and eggs carry proteins which is nutritious. ,” added the dietician.
