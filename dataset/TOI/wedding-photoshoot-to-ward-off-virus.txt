ALAPPUZHA: A bride and groom from Alappuzha have made their pre-wedding photoshoot and their wedding a platform for creating awareness among people to remain safe from Covid-19. Their pre-wedding photoshoot pictures became viral on social media. 


Rahul Neelapparambil, a native of Mannancherry, and Sreelekshmi T of Muhamma were eagerly awaiting till Sunday — the day they were getting married after a six-year-long courtship. So, both of them invited over 2,500 people for their wedding and reception programmes. 

They had a lot of plans on their wedding day and they did a pre-wedding photoshoot (‘save the date’ shoot). That is when Covid-19 phase two struck the state, casting a shadow on their dream-wedding plans. The heath department directed them to conduct their nuptials in the presence of only their immediate family members and avoid a large gathering. 

“We got directions to avoid functions for the people with only three days remaining for our wedding. We had to inform all our invited friends and neighbours about it. Though initially, we were crestfallen, we decided to turn it into a postive event which would be a platform to create awareness about this disease. We had to re-do our ‘save the date’ photoshoot in which we conveyed the guidelines of the health department to prevent Covid-19 and posted them on social media. Through the pictures we sent across a message to avoid hand shakes and wear masks when coming in contact with people. They were an instant hit and the responses were great. Our invitees soon understood our predicament,” said Rahul.

On the wedding day, they exhibited the guidelines of the health department on Covid-19 and clicked the post-wedding pictures were clicked wearing masks.

Rahul is the owner of Frame Creators wedding company and the bride Sreelekshmi too is learning photography.
