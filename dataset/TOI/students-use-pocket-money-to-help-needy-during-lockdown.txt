2020-05-22
Madurai: A group of students and a few who recently passed out from city colleges, who are members of an NGO, have contributed their pocket money to help poor people in villages around Thirumangalam, who were severely affected by the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. So far, they have reached out to 250 families in distress in 19 villages. Besides students, few members, who are IT employees, also make generous contributions from their salaries to help the needy.Nizhalalagam, the NGO, was started by Abinaya Sundarapandian from Thirupparankundram in 2018 while she was doing her MBA from a city college. There are 200 volunteers in this forum, which is managed by six members.It was started with the intension of feeding the needy. The volunteers are into various social activities including taking tuition for underprivileged students and engaging government school students in spoken English classes. Those, who cannot afford monetary contribution, give their talents and manpower, Sundarapandian said.“We have not collected money from people outside our group so far. We mobilize money from members, whoever can contribute. While students contribute from their pocket money, those who are employed, share a part of their salary. Although, many have faced salary cuts due to lockdown, they still contribute whatever they can,” Sundarapandian said.Members of Nizhalalagam said that there are many out there to help the needy in city areas, but there is no one to take care of the people in rural areas. The NGO members join hands with social workers from villages to identify the needy so that the contributions reach them. Most of the people, who received help, are sanitary employees, daily wagers and members of 100-day work scheme, Sundarapandian said.“Anna Nagar assistant commissioner of police, Lilly Grace is helping us with food through district administration,” she said.
