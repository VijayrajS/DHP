Covid-19 sampling in Rani Mandi leads to panic in area
2020-06-01
Prayagraj: Panic gripped Rani Mandi and adjoining areas under Attarsuiya police station for an hour when a large number of people assembled for Covid sampling. 

Whe nthe health department enforced “Operation Prayagraj” to collect samples of migrants and locals to test for Covid infection, a huge crowd, other than the people who had registered for sampling, assembled in Rani Mandi. To this, the registered group of locals raised objections and called the police, complaining of violation of social distancing. 

“Local corporator and other peace committee members sent the crowd back to their homes,” said Attarsuiya inspector

Police also said that people who were registered for sampling in different batches also assembled together due to late arrival of medical teams who had to collect samples. This also led to a chaotic situation, and medical teams collected samples amid police presence. Meanwhile, a minor girl tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday night, taking the district Covid tally to 87. Nodal officer and additional CMO Dr Rishi Sahai said that the number of active cases is 26. While 58 patients have been recovered and discharged, three patients have died, he added.

On Sunday, officials of health department received reports of 60 samples including 24 from Fatehpur, 14 from Chitrakoot, 13 from Prayagraj and nine from Pratapgarh and two patients ( one each from Chitrakoot and Fatehpur) tested positive for coronavirus.
