2020-04-18
Panaji: Deriding the state government’s decision to increase the price ceiling for purchase of new vehicles for ministers and bureaucrats, MGP demanded that the circular to this effect should be deferred until the Covid-19 pandemic eases out.

Senior party leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that new government vehicles should not be purchased till December due to the ongoing global health crisis.

“When the government is borrowing money to run the state, how can new vehicles be purchased?” he asked. tnn
