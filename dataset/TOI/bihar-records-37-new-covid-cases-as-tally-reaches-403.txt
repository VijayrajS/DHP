PATNA: Bihar recorded 37 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, including five migrant workers, who had recently returned to West Champaran from New Delhi. Three of the latest cases were reported from Patna district. The total number of Covid-19 cases has reached 403 with 336 active cases, two deaths and 65 people cured.


As per information shared by the state health department principal secretary, Sanjay Kumar, a 25-year-old woman from Raja Bazaar in Patna tested positive along with another 45-year-old woman from Paliganj and a 24-year-old woman from Naubatpur in Patna district.

Kumar said five migrant workers at Sanichari in West Champaran, who tested positive on Wednesday, were quarantined soon after they arrived in Bihar and were tested for the coronavirus. “So far 44 migrant workers in the state have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus,” he added. 

After the Wednesday’s nod from the ministry of home affairs to allow stranded students, laborers and others to return, pressure on the state has mounted on how to tackle the Covid-19 cases which may further increase. 

Kumar accepted that the government’s job will become more difficult and now the state’s strategy will depend on the number of migrants who will be coming, as well as the number of positive cases. 

Maximum number of positive cases on Wednesday were reported from Buxar where 14 people were found positive for coronavirus. The list includes six children, youngest one being just six month old. Four other positive cases were reported from Darbhanga Town, three from Rohtas, including two from Jamuhar in Sasaram, two from Bhojpur and two from Begusarai and one each from Dharamdaspur in Vaishali, Bardaha in Madhepura, Pipri in Sitamarhi and Aurangabad.
