Bokaro: The 62 health workers at Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) whose swab and blood samples were sent for a Covid-19 test after they recently came in contact with a 75-year-old Covid-19 patient, came out negative on Thursday night. Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar said, “All the 62 samples that were sent to the testing centres in Ranchi and Dhanbad, came out negative. The samples were sent on the basis of contact tracing.” 

The 75-year-old man, who had come to BGH in the first week of April with chest pain and shortness of breath, was being treated at the the hospital’s critical care unit. It was only found out later that he was a Covid-19 patient after one of the BGH doctors, fearing that the man has symptoms of the virus, sent his blood samples for a test. The senior citizen, who lived in Gomia block, died soon after his test results came out and the doctors treating him were put under quarantine. 

With nine positive cases of Covid-19, Bokaro has become the second district in Jharkhand after Ranchi with the most number of coronavirus patients. Of these, five are residents of Chandrapura block and four belong to Gomia block. Out of the nine, eight are being treated in BGH. 

Civil surgeon Ashok Kumar Pathak said the situation in Bokaro is completely under control. “As of now, the possibility of community transition here is negligible,” he added. 

So far, 316 samples from Bokaro were sent for a Covid-19 test Rims, Ranchi and PMCH, Dhanbad. Of which, 250 tested negative, nine were positive and the results of 57 are yet to come.
