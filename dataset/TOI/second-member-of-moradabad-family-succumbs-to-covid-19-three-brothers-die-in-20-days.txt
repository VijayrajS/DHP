2020-04-26
BAREILLY: A family in Moradabad’s Nawabpura, which has been quarantined ever since one of its members, a 49-year-old man, tested positive for Covid-19 on April 9, lost its second member to the pandemic on Saturday. This was the third death in the family in the past 20 days.

The 44-year-old man, who died on Saturday, was the third brother the family lost. His elder brother had succumbed to the novel coronavirus on April 13. 

Prior to that, their eldest brother, 70, had died due to an “unknown” disease and was buried secretly in a nearby graveyard on April 5. The health department suspects that he also suffered from Covid-19 since he had visited the Nizamuddin area in Delhi recently.

Health officials said that at least 31 members of the family and relatives – 12 women and 19 men – are under quarantine.

Notably, after the first member of the family had died of Covid-19 on April 13, a team of health staff and policemen had reached the Nawabpura area to bring other family members to the quarantine centre when a mob pelted stones at them, which left two doctors and four policemen injured.

Moradabad has 92 active Covid-19 cases while four have lost their lives. In a big relief, 140 suspects, including 21 medical staff and 33 policemen, tested negative on Saturday.

Moradabad chief medical officer Dr MC Garg said that three suspects tested positive on Saturday. “Among three positive cases, one is a police constable, second is a resident of Peerjada locality whose younger brother is already positive. The third one had died on Saturday morning hours before his report came in.”
