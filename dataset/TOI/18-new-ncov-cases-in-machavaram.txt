VIJAYAWADA: Machavaram continued to remain on high alert after 18 new Covid-19 cases reported on Sunday morning.

With a total of 40 cases registered till Sunday, Karmika Nagar in Machavaram has become a hotspot for Covid-19. A 29-year-old foreign returnee has been identified as the primary contact for all cases reported in the area.

Health and revenue officials who were baffled at 40 positive cases in the small hill-top colony in Machavaram carried out a detailed investigation on the source of the infection. The foreign returnee, it was found, had flouted guidelines on home quarantine and self-isolation, and roamed on the streets.

The foreign returnee had also travelled to Chennai. He spent a lot of time at an eatery run by his parents outside their house. As he did not exhibit any symptoms for over 20 days, the issue came to light only after his father fell ill. After all three persons in the family tested positive, officials declared Machavaram a red zone.

Locals who came into contact with the foreign returnee and his family were also shifted to quarantine centres. A family of six in the same neighbourhood also later tested positive.

City police lodged a criminal case against the foreign returnee who ignored home quarantine guidelines. 

“Everyone should be cautious about the spread of novel coronavirus. A small negligence can cause huge damage. The situation would be different if the foreign returnee stayed back home. We took the issue seriously and filed a case against him,” said police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao.

Meanwhile, Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) authorities and city police blocked all roads in Machavaram and intensified sanitation activity.
