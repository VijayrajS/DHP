AURANGABAD: The house of a nurse, working at a Covid-19 treatment centre, was attacked by a group of people who want the healthcare professional and her husband to leave the locality.

The suspects, claiming that the nurse may become a source of infection in their area (Mali Galli), abused her husband and kicked at the door before pelting stones in the wee hours of Monday.

Shilpa Hivrale, the nurse, said, “Since the Covid-19 cases started emerging in Aurangabad, I am being constantly threatened and troubled by some locals who want us to vacate the rented accommodation. Few days ago, the tyres of our vehicle were also deflated in order to harass us.”

During the attack, the woman made a call to the police control room following which, a team was sent to the spot. The family was then taken to the police station to record statements.

As per their complaint, the suspects knocked on their door at 12.30am and asked for drinking water. As Hirvale’s husband was getting water, some of them suddenly started showering abuses and kicking the door.

Taking cognizance of the complaint, MIDC Cidco police have registered a non-cognizable offence against the suspects. Inspector Vitthale Pote said, “We have registered a non-cognizable offence against the suspects who have been brought to police station and preventive action is being initiated against them.”

The officer said that it is being probed if stones were pelted on the house where the couple came to live around six months ago.

Sources in the police said the suspects have a history of being at loggerheads with the nurse’s landlord. The friction between them is about using a road in the locality. 

This friction took another turn when some of them tried to highlight the fact that the woman is employed as a nurse with the Covid regional hospital in Chikalthana and may become a source of infection for others in the locality.
