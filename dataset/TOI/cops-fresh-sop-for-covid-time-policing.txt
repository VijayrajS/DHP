Cops’ fresh SOP for Covid-time policing
2020-06-10
Nagpur: The latest Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by the state police headquarters, viewing the increased occurrence of the Covid infection in the force, have introduced several adaptions which will raise the hygiene standard and also transform many working methods including arrests.

The current SOP, which would be circulated among city police stations through DCP, special branch and corona nodal officer, Shweta Khedkar soon, have guidelines right from the how a police personnel shall come to the police station to how must s/he carry out arrest, interrogate and investigate. 

IG, law and order, Milind Bharambhe, who issued the order from Mumbai, said the SOP contains the guidelines regarding working of police following Covid distancing and sanitization. “They have been issued in a generalized manner but one has to follow them as per the situation like where to wear gloves or PPE kits,” he said. 

It has been made specific for the cops to have a closer look at the accused for telltale signs like whether they are coughing or having temperature or any symptom of a Covid patient. “Arrests to be made where necessary after conducting medical test, particularly Covid screening. Every personnel should wear mask and frequently use sanitizer,” said the officer.

“Interrogations should be conducted separately and if any accused is having symptoms then they must be kept separately,” he said. 

Earlier, anyone calling up ‘100’ for help had police personnel attending them. “ Now, if such calls to the control room originate from the containment zones then we first would ask the caller to opt for filing online complaint unless something requires immediate intervention,” the officer explained. 

City police chief BK Upadhyay said the latest SOP was more ‘systematically’ drafted. “Repeatedly, we have been reminding the force to wear masks during duties, faceshields at containment zones, use gloves, PPE kits at high risk places. We also ensured that everyone was supplied with adequate sanitizers,” he said. 

As per the new guidelines, the police are also required to sanitize their vehicles, especially the steering, gears, doors and also seats repeatedly. Even the handles, grills, side bars of the staircases, switches, gates, windows, chairs and restrooms are to be repeatedly sanitized. “There would be less crowding of complainants at the police stations dealing with only urgent matters. Everyone would sit at safe distance from each other. Vehicles should not be crowded. Some staffers can use own vehicles,” a senior officer said. 

The official said the guidelines also deal with personal behaviour too like repeatedly cleaning one’s sticks, weapons, belongings and minimal sharing. 

A senior cop said that following the guidelines would be tough especially when a dreaded criminal is needed to be nabbed from any place regardless of it being containment zones or hotspot. “There would be calculated risks and sometimes faults too but police duty cannot be so much regularized,” he added.
