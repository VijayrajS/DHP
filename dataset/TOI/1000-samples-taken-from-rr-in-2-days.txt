HYDERABAD: Increasing cases of Covid- 19 due to Jiaguda link has sent officials of Rangareddy district running. In a major effort to find Covid positive patients, more than 1,000 samples were collected from four areas of the district in the last two days.

The samples were collected from Shadnagar, NTR Nagar, Maheswaram and Pahadi Shareef. 

“Many of the cases being reported have been primary or secondary contacts of the Covid-19 positive cases, so we have decided to collect the samples of all the people who have shown some symptoms of Covid- 19,” an official said

Currently, the government is not doing tests on secondary contacts, but many samples were collected as an exception. “Looking at the urgency and spread of cases, authorities have started operating a government quarantine centre in Rajendra Nagar area for the district. Over the past few days, government closed all the quarantine centres which are outside government hospitals,” said a top source.

The district has witnessed about 10 deaths, which is a cause of concern for officials. 

Many cases from the district are being reported as secret socialising, which has not stopped despite government advocating against any gathering. 

On Thursday, another 8 people tested positive from Pahadi Shareef as they were in contact with people who tested positive because of a super spreader in the area. Apart from these, a medical representative and one RMP also tested positive in the district.
