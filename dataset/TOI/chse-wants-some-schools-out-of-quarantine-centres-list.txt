CHSE wants some schools out of quarantine centres’ list
2020-05-28
Bhubaneswar: The Council of Higher Secondary Education (CHSE) has asked district collectors to vacate higher secondary school buildings, which are being used as quarantine centres, as evaluation of Plus II answer sheets is scheduled to start from June 1. 

The CHSE has also suggested to collectors to barricade and sanitise the unutilised portion of the buildings so that it can be used as evaluation centres. As many as 482 junior colleges have been used as quarantine centres and 40 of these are evaluation centres, official sources said.

“We have not asked the district administrations to vacate all evaluation centres but only those where no returnees have been lodged so far. Even if a portion of the same building is provided, then it can be used for proper barricading and sanitisation for evaluation work,” said director of CHSE Amarendra Patnaik. 

However, teachers have resented the proposal to carry out evaluation at centres separated from quarantine centres with the help of barricades. “We are ready for the evaluation work but not at the centres being used as quarantine centres. The government is not providing us any security. In the current Covid-19 situation, most of the positive cases are being detected from quarantine centres. How is the government asking teachers to evaluate copies in the same building,” said Prabitra Mahala, convenor of a teachers’ association.

Beside, some of the papers of the annual Plus II examinations have been postponed due to the lockdown and the fresh dates for the examinations are yet to be announced.
