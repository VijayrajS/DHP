In a separate meeting attended by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev and senior bureaucrats, the LG also reviewed the strategies for containment zones management including proper delineation, strict perimeter control and active surveillance.

The LG office in a statement said the decision form an expert panel was taken in view of rapidly increasing corona-positive cases. “The expert committee will give its suggestions on measures required to ramp up medical infrastructure and adopt best global and national practices,” the statement said and quoted LG as saying that the efforts being made by DDMA were needed to be bolstered by concerted planning, use of latest technology, efficient monitoring and seamless coordination amongst various agencies to overcome the challenge.
