2020-05-31
MANGALURU/UDUPI: People with a history of inter-state travel continued to fuel the Covid-19 graph of erstwhile undivided Dakshina Kannada district northward. A majority of the 27 positive cases that Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts recorded on Saturday, including 14 in Dakshina Kannada, were people with a history of inter-state travel, and 25 of these cases were returnees from Maharashtra. One case in Dakshina Kannada was a contact of another person, and a patient in Udupi had come from Telangana.

Incidentally, this was the scenario in the state as well, with 90 out of 141 positive cases reported during the day being people with a history of inter-state travel. The discharge of 50 patients – five from Dakshina Kannada and 45 from Udupi—brought big relief to the respective district administrations that are battling a huge backlog of swab samples - 5920 in Udupi alone, which could set off a new surge of fresh positive cases in the days ahead. 

With the day’s development, total positive cases in Dakshina Kannada rose to 113, active cases was 68 and total number of patients discharged stood at 44. The district has also recorded six deaths, and one death due to non-Covid reasons. Udupi on the other hand has a total of 127 active cases against 177 positive cases, 50 discharges and has recorded one death so far. The lone contact case in Dakshina Kannada was that of P-2871, a teenager, who came in contact with P-947 and P-2794 is a 2-year-old girl who returned from Telangana to Udupi.

Incidentally, the two coastal districts had recorded a big spike on Thursday, reporting 53 cases collectively. While no case was reported in Dakshina Kannada on Friday, Udupi had recorded 15 cases.
