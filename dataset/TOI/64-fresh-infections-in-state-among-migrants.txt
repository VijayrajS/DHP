2020-05-19
JAIPUR: With migrants arriving in the state in large numbers, the number of positive cases has seen a spike in the last few days. Out of 305 Covid-19 cases reported on Monday, 196 were migrants, which accounts for 64% of the total cases. 

The worst-affected district was Dungarpur where 64 persons tested positive taking the number of infected migrants to 116. 

Bhilwara, which came to light for its ruthless containment model, reported 25 cases on Monday and all of them were migrants. With the new 25 cases, the number of positive cases has risen to 80 cases in Bhilwara. Out of the 80 cases, 42 are migrants. 

Over the past few days, a large number of migrants entered the state from Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat such as Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara. Health department officials claimed that they were keeping a watch on the health of all migrant workers entering the state especially those who travelled from hotspots such as Indore, Surat, Ahmedabad and different parts of Maharashtra including Mumbai. 

In Jalore, out of 25 coronavirus cases, 23 are migrants. All the 10 cases in Rajsamand are migrant workers. 

A health department official said since May 1, they have detected 656 migrants infected with coronavirus. Almost all of them are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. They have been sent to quarantine facilities where they are undergoing treatment. 

The worst affected districts due to migrants who tested positive are Dungarpur (116), Jalore (86), Pali (54) and Rajsamand (49). The health department has stepped up measures for contact tracing of all the migrants reaching different parts of the state. The job is challenging as many of those travelled by buses and they have to search for other co-passengers for testing.
