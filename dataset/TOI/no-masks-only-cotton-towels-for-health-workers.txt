Coronavirus in Kerala: No masks, only cotton towels for health workers
2020-03-24
KOCHI: Use of masks as a precaution against Covid-19 has become common but their unscientific disposal has made waste collectors employed by Kochi corporation jittery. The only protective gear that the corporation has provided them so far are cotton bath towels, which they are supposed to wrap around their face. 

“Everyone is dropping their masks along with plastic waste. Few days ago, the corporation gave us cotton bath towels asking us to cover our face. But not everyone has got them,” said Fasila, a health worker in the circle 17 of the corporation, who had been in the job as a Kudumbashree worker for the past 13 years. 

“We have bought gloves and masks on our own and are using them,” she said.

Mayor Soumini Jain after a special meeting on March 10 had stated that the local body would utilize own funds to provide sanitation workers with protective masks. 

“We are the ones who visit most number of homes, yet we are denied such material,” said Mohanashwin, convener of Ernakulam District Malinya Nirmarjana Thozhilali Union affliated to CITU. The union, which has around 370 members, wants the corporation to provide them with hand wash and sanitizers. 

Corporation health officer Thomas Joshy said they have started providing workers with carbolic soaps, gloves and two pairs of bath towels.
