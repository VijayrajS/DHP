SURAT: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will quarantine an area of one km radius in Rander town from where a 67-year-old man, the second form the same area, had tested positive for Covid-19.

"Besides disinfection activity in and around the area where local transmission is feared in Rander, we are quarantining one km radius as a precautionary measure and it will be a mass quarantine. Red signage will be put up in the area for public notice,'' Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, said. 

The 67- year-old man has no travel history and SMC fears that he may have come in contact with many people in and around Rander. The civic body has already shifted 30 people in his contact to quarantine facility.

Meanwhile, a 29-year-old male from Singanpore having travel history to Dubai tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. He was admitted in the SMIMER Hospital after he developed suspected symptoms of the virus on March 30. He had come in the contact with the Covid-19 positive patient from Ghod Dod Road on March 15. With this, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city touched eight. 

Deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospital), Dr Ashish Naik said, “About 17 close contacts of this patient have been shifted to the quarantine facility at Samras Hostel.”

About seven new suspected cases were admitted in the isolation ward of the NCH and SMIMER on Tuesday. Barring one, none others have travel history. A 37-year-old male from Nanavat had travelled to South Africa and returned on March 19.
