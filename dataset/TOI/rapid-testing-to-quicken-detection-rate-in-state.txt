Rapid testing to quicken detection rate in Goa
2020-04-07
PANAJI: In a step towards speeding detection rate in the battle against Covid-19, the state government on Monday announced that it will start using rapid tests to screen suspects. Those who test positive will then be made to undergo the confirmatory test.


“Health workers will visit suspects and take samples. People need not visit a hospital. Results will be available in an hour,” chief minster Pramod Sawant said.

The rapid testing will be conducted at the North Goa district hospital in Mapusa and sub-district hospital in Ponda, from Wednesday. 

Sawant said that for this purpose the government has tied up with Goa-based company Molbio and procured five machines from it. 

“Not all will be asked to take rapid tests, only those who health workers identify as suspects,” Sawant said.

A Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) ward is being set-up at the Goa Medical College (GMC) for patients coming with respiratory illness. Those admitted to this ward will be made to undergo the rapid test. If any one tests positive, a confirmatory test will be done and, based on the result, the person will be shifted to the ESI hospital at Margao.

Rapid testing will help faster shifting of positive cases to ESI, Sawant said. The confirmatory test takes about 12 hours, he said.

Sawant said two hotels have been requisitioned to quarantine frontline health workers of the GMC and ESI hospital. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said International Centre Goa has been requisitioned for this

The DHS has appealed to those who have returned to India after March 8, and to all who have or have had symptoms to report on the 104 helpline.
