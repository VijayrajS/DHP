The other patient who tested positive late on Friday night is a 23-year-old resident of Habra in North 24 Parganas. The young woman had recently returned from Scotland, where she is pursuing an MBA course. She followed the instruction at the airport and headed straight to the Beliaghata ID Hospital, unlike the first two city patients who had sought hospitalization after several days at their res-pective homes raising a scare of transmission. 

Now under treatment, doctors said her condition is stable. His father, a friend and the family driver have been kept in home isolation.

With rumours doing the rounds that the girl had come to her Habra home on Thursday morning before heading to the hospital, neighbours lock themselves in their homes. On being informed by locals, a medical team accompanied by the police reached her home and sanitized it. 

Health department officials said the girl had gone to the hospital straight from the airport but stood in the queue at the emergency for a couple of hours. “We are now trying to trace all the people who came in contact with her,” they said.
