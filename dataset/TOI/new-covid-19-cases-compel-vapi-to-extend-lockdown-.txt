Surat: Vapi Municipality in Valsad district on Wednesday decided to continue with lockdown guidelines until May 24 despite relaxation in the fourth phase by the state government in the aftermath of detection of seven new Covid-19 cases in the industrial town of late. The decision was made after a meeting chaired by Valsad district collector C R Kharasan. The meeting was attended by Vapi Municipality president Vitthal Patel, Pardi MLA Kanubhai Desai, industrialists and traders among others. "It has been unanimously decided to observe lockdown in the areas falling under the limits of Vapi Municipality until May 24 because of seven new Covid-19 cases in Vapi town in the last one week. On Tuesday, two vegetable vendors tested positive for Covid-19 in Vapi town. These vendors have shops at Vibrant Vegetable Markets and are residents of Satadhar Society in the town,'' Vitthal Patel told TOI. Municipality authorities fear that the vegetable vendors could be ‘super spreaders’ as they may have come into contact with hundreds of people while carrying out business transactions. "This is a precautionary step by us and all traders and businessmen have voluntarily decided to observe lockdown. However, essential services will continue unhindered between 8am and 12pm,'' Patel said. "All shops and commercial establishments in residential and market areas of GIDC, Vapi will voluntarily remain closed for four days from Thursday. However, industrial activities will continue as suggested by lockdown guidelines of the state government,'' Vapi Industries Association informed its members.
