HYDERABAD: As many as 56 IT firm employees from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh returned home on Tuesday from China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of the Coronavirus (Covid-19). The employees were working as trainees with a Chinese company for the past six months.



Upon their return to India, the employees had been put under a 14-day quarantine at the Army camp in Manesar. None of them were detected with the virus and were presented a certificate by the Union home ministry as attestation for the same. “We did not face any problems during our stay at the camp. They cheeked our temperatures daily and tested us the virus twice. We were tested two days ago,” one of the returnees told TOI.

The Chinese company had asked the employees to work from home till the epidemic was under control. They will be returning once the situation improves in China. The employees have received their salaries from the company while they were away. Another two employees, who had been ill and stayed in Wuhan as a result, will be returning during the third evacuation drive by the Indian government.
