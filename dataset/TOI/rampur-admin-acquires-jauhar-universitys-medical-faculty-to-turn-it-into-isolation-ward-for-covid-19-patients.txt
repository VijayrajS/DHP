Speaking with TOI, district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said, “Acting as per the Disaster Management Act, we have acquired the building. The centre will have 100 beds. We have asked the doctors and the other medical staff members, including the nurses, of the district hospital to use the varsity’s medical college building.”

Responding to the matter, vice-chancellor of Jauhar University Sultan Muhammad Khan, said, “We had approached the administration a week ago and asked them to use the medical college building to treat Covid-19 patients. Now, we have received the letter from the office of the sub-divisional magistrate to turn the building to quarantine facility.” 

The university was established in 2006 by the Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust in Rampur. Its chancellor is Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan, who, along with his wife Tazeen Fatima and son Abdullah Azam, is lodged in Sitapur district jail after they had surrendered before the court under the charges of forgery. The varsity was granted university status in 2012.
