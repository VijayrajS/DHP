KOCHI: Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has initiated measures to fight the novel coronavirus. It sanitised stations, trains and premises on Friday.

“We have taken various protective measures to prevent the spread of the virus. All station employees have been made aware of steps to be taken. Our mission is to ensure that every passenger feels safe in a hygienic environment,” said KMRL MD Alkesh Kumar Sharma. 

“We recently launched the ‘Pavan Doot’ bus service from Aluva station to the airport. Close to 400 air passengers are using the service. So we thought it is ideal to go ahead with a sanitisation drive in the buses as well.” he added.

Meanwhile, in the district, 15 persons were placed under surveillance on Friday as part of the Covid-19 alert while thirteen people were removed from the watch list following the completion of the probation period.
