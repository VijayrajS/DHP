2020-06-05
HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday directed the state to furnish the status of Covid-19 a patient from Vanasthalipuram by Friday. 


The bench of chief justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a plea filed by the patient’s wife, seeking the whereabouts of her husband who was admitted in Gandhi hospital on April 30. 

Prior to this, her father-in-law tested positive and succumbed to the disease. 

She, along with her children were quarantined in a government hospital and were later discharged. 

She brought to the notice of the court the multiple statements made by the state and GHMC that her husband too succumbed and that his body had been cremated.

“But we were not given any information,” she said.

She filed this plea as a habeas corpus petition and sought to know the whereabouts of her husband.

“Even in the case of a Covid-19 death, the norms say that the authorities should videograph the cremation and give it to the family. Leave alone videograph, we were not even intimated as to what happened to my husband,” she lamented. 

The high court bench sought information on this by Friday.
