Different lockdown conditions in NIBM Road area
2020-06-03
Pune: The lockdown scenario in NIBM Road is a study in contrast, with different rules being followed in the same area. 

While the rules are strict on some stretches, restrictions are followed more in the breach in some parts.On the stretch along Jyoti restaurant, barricades have been removed and several non-essential shops have started functioning. 

Vijay Shah, a resident of Parmar Park society in the area, said, "All shops, including wine stores and gift shops, have reopened here." But the scene is quite different a few metres away. Near the RIMS International School on NIBM Post Office Road, the lockdown rules are quite stringent. Only essential shops are open right up to Cloud 9 society. 

"The grocery shops are open from 10am to 2pm. Dairy and medical shops are open, too. But nothing else. There have been relaxations in lockdown regulations everywhere, but not here. We hope non-essential shops open their shutters here soon. The rules are followed strictly here. Grocery shopowners do not entertain anyone without mask," said Rahul Kumar, a resident of Orchid Palace society.

Near Nivedita Garden society, off NIBM Road, most non-essential shops have started functioning. Even a beauty parlour has opened shutters, but is attending to clients by appointment only while taking utmost precaution.
