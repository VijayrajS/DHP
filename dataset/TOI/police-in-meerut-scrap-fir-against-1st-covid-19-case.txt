MEERUT: Police in UP’s Meerut have scrapped the FIR registered against the first novel coronavirus patient of the district. The local police said that the case was taken back after it was found that the victim was not aware about him being positive. Earlier, he was being considered as the reason behind the spread of the disease in Meerut as he had come in contact with hundreds within 24 hours.


Ashutosh Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Nauchandi police station, said, “Police have scrapped the FIR against the first coronavirus positive case of Meerut. All of his contacts have tested positive for the disease here. The FIR was cancelled after it was found during investigation that the person in question was not aware about him being positive. In fact, his health deteriorated on March 24 after which he approached the Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College.”

TOI had earlier reported that an FIR was filed against the first coronavirus positive case of Meerut under Epidemic Diseases Act, and section 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code.

“We wanted to give out the message that anybody with symptoms of coronavirus should come forward and not hide it from the authorities. This is the only way that we can help in containing the disease,” said Kumar
