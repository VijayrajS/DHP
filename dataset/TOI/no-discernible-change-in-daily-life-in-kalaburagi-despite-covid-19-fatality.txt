No discernible change in daily life in Kalaburagi despite Covid-19 fatality
2020-03-14
Kalaburagi: Although the first confirmed death in India owing to novel coronavirus or Covid-19, which was reported in Kalaburagi turned the attention of the national media towards the district in North Karnataka, in addition to making headlines across India, this momentous event appears to have little to no impact on the routine activities of the people here.

Notwithstanding the order issued by the district administration closing down all malls, theatres, parks, schools and colleges, people could still be found milling about in crowds at markets, business establishments and temples. Very few people were found wearing masks in Kalaburagi city.

Most small traders and merchants kept their stores open, and did not register a marked dip in their turnover despite the panic over the outbreak of the disease.

The only discernible difference was in the turnout at the Sharanabasaveshwara Mela, a religious fare that is attended by nearly one lakh devotees every year. However, following restrictions clamped down by the district administration – the officials also appealed to the temple authorities to scale down the affair – the ritual was a markedly low-profile affair on Friday. Despite the temple authorities reaching out to the people to avoid coming to the fair, there was a considerable turnout.

Shivalingappa H, one of the devotees who turned up at the Sharanabasaveshwara shrine on Friday, said that he had been coming to the temple for the ritual for the past many years, and did not want to snap the tradition owing to Covid-19. “To me, seeking the Almighty’s blessings is more important than the virus,” he said.

Revanna Siddappa, who lives in a village not very far from Kalaburagi city, said, “I come to the city every day. And it does not look like there is any trouble. But if the situation worsens in the coming days, I will stop coming to the city.”
