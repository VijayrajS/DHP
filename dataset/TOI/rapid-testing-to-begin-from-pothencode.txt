2020-04-04
Thiruvananthapuram: The rapid test for suspected Covid-19 cases will begin in state capital soon. For this, 1,000 testing kits were handed over by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to the district administration on Friday. Rapid tests will be performed among the people in Pothencode region who have been put under high risk category.

Vijayan who handed over the kit to collector K Gopalakrishnan, congratulated Shashi Tharoor for using his MP fund for this and making these kits available for the district administration. “These kits will help the authorities to get the results in two-and-a-half hour. However, we cannot claim it as a final result,” he said.

The blood samples of people here will be taken to check whether there have been any spread of the virus in the panchayat. This is being done since a 69-year-old person from this panchayat was tested positive and he later died in the hospital.. He neither had any travel history nor had he been in the direct contact list o any positives. 

The final procedure on sampling and testing protocol will be decided in the technical committee meeting scheduled to be held on Saturday. The meeting will be chaired by the collector and attended by DMO Dr P P Preetha, health and revenue officials. Rapid test will help find out the presence of virus in blood through a simple testing procedure that will take only 45 minutes for results. 

The first set of the kits reached the state capital from Pune-based Mylabs. This was purchased using the MP fund of Shashi Tharoor. Another set of 2,000 kits will be reaching the district on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, the district administration and the city corporation authorities continued the disinfection activities in the Pothencode panchayat area and also in the city areas like Karimadom Colony and East Fort.
