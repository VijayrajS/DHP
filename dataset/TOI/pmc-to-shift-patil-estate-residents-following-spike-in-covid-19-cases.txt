PMC to shift Patil Estate residents following spike in Covid-19 cases
2020-04-30
PUNE: The civic administration is set to shift residents from every alternate home in the Patil Estate slum to temporary shelters following the spike in Covid-19 cases.


Officials said all high- and low-risk contacts in the slum were being sent to various quarantine facilities. Located close to the College of Engineering, Pune, flyover, the slum has so far registered 130 Covid-19 cases and emerged as one of the hotspots for the contagion in the city. 

The slum pocket comes under the Shivajinagar-Ghole Road civic ward, which has so far seen around 175 positive cases. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said the slum shared 75% of the ward’s Covid-19 load. “The administration is ensuring health check-up of all residents in the slum and counselling them about social distancing,”he said. 

The Patil Estate slum area extends up to Shivajianagar railway station, beyond which the locality is equally congested. The PMC had sealed the area on April 13 after the slum pocket started reporting cases. The slum is located on both sides of the old Pune-Mumbai highway and at a key junction, from where the roads lead to Khadki, Sangamwadi, RTO and the city’s central parts. 

The official said, “The recent spike in cases is because of effective contact tracing and screening of people. We will tell people from families with many members to shift to the shelters. This will be applicable for those living in very small homes.”

Local MLA Siddharth Shirole said. “The administration has deployed additional staffers at the slum and the containment plan is being modified as per the requirements.”
