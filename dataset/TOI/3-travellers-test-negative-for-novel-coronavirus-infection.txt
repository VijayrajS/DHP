PUNE: Throat swab samples of three travellers isolated at Naidu hospital tested negative for novel coronavirus infection on Thursday, allaying fears of the contagion reaching the city.

 
 
“These travellers had recently returned from China and were isolated on Tuesday and Wednesday after they developed minor illness. Their throat swab samples tested negative for the novel coronavirus on Thursday. Earlier, two travellers had tested negative for the disease,” Ramchandra Hankare, chief of the health department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said. 

He said the throat swab samples of the five isolated travellers would be retested at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in the next three days days. “They will be discharged if they test negative again,” Hankare said.

A total of 4,846 passengers returning from China and other affected countries have been screened at the Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport since January 18. Of them, 28 travellers, who are residents of Pune, Mumbai, Pimpri Chinchwad, Kalyan, Vasai, Virar and Nanded, are under the surveillance for the next 28 days.


Three from Kasturba hospital discharged
Three travellers quarantined for suspected coronavirus last week at Kasturba hospital at Chinchpokli in Mumbai were discharged on Thursday after they tested negative for the infection twice. 

Besides, two more individuals with travel history from China were admitted to the hospital on Thursday, taking the count of isolated patients in Mumbai to five. Overall, 11 patients are quarantined across the state, including five from Pune and one from Nanded.

The discharged patients included a 31-year-old woman from Nalasopara, a 36-year-old man from Kalyan and a 65-year-old British national.
