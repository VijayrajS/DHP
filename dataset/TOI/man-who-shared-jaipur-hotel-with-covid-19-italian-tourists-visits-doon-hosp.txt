DEHRADUN: A city resident, who had gone to Jaipur on a business trip and had stayed in the same hotel where Italian tourists were staying, visited Doon Hospital on Friday. Many of these foreign tourists were later diagnosed with coronavirus and the man was apprehensive that he, too, might have caught the disease.


Samples taken from the patient were sent to National Institute of Virology for tests by the health department. Dr Meenakshi Joshi, Dehradun’s chief medical officer, told TOI, “The man claims that he shared hotel space with Italian tourists who were later tested coronavirus-positive. He only had a minor fever, so he was sent back home but with necessary directions. However, as we cannot neglect the chances of coronavirus infection completely, we are not taking any case lightly.”

Meanwhile, the Mindrolling Monastery of the Buddhist community in Clement Town was shut till further notice in view of the coronavirus scare. The monastery will remain shut for a while, announced its officials. Established in 1965, the monastery is thronged by a large number of locals and tourists on a regular basis.
