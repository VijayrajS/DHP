“The commissioner had requested me to do a special video capturing the mood of the state. I have written the song, which has been set to tune by Arjun Janya and sung by Vijay Prakash. It will not feature film actors or celebrities; instead we are looking at celebrating those who are fighting for the welfare of everyone, be it the government, police force, BBMP task force and the many media personnel who are reporting live from the hotspots. I have already shot some portions of the video with the Chief Minister, some cabinet ministers and members of the police force,” says Yogaraj, adding that the song also highlights some prominent philanthropists, like Sudha Murty, for instance.
