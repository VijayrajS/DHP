Another case was reported from Gorwa area of the city. The youth used to stay and work at the same place form where a housekeeping and catering agency operated. Four members of the agency have already tested positive. The agency has contracts of hospitals and other facilities including the warehouse of an online platform providing grocery, vegetables, fruits, grocery and other essential products in the city.

The lesser number of cases reported in the city on Friday were also due to the fact that only 135 tests were conducted since Thursday evening. Most of the new cases are from the old city areas.

Eight patients who were discharged on Friday included three from a Covid Care Centre, four from SSG Hospital and one from a private hospital. 

The death toll due to Covid-19 in the city may have remained at 32, but it has raised several eyebrows.

Sources said that despite such audits being submitted for some cases, the deaths were yet to be declared.
