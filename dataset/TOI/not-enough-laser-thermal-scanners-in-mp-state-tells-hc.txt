2020-03-23
BHOPAL: The state government has admitted in the M P high court that it doesn’t have enough laser thermal scanners and that they are being purchased from wherever they are available. The state government presented a status report on the coronavirus situation before the double bench of Chief Justice A K Mittal and Justice V K Shukla.

The court, which is hearing petitions relating to the coronavirus menace, will next hear the case on March 26.

Sunil Jain, an advocate from Gwalior, who is also among the petitioners, had stated in the court that the state government is ill-equipped to handle the situation arising out of the spread of COVID-19 in the country. It doesn’t have adequate medical facilities to isolate coronavirus-infected persons for treatment, the petition said. Besides, it does not have laser thermal scanners to check people at public places, including government offices, district courts, bus stands and railway stations, it added.

The court, in this context, had asked the state government to present a status report and asked whether it has enough laser thermal scanners.
