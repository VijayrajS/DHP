2020-05-18
Ludhiana: As many as 36 Covid-19 patients were discharged from civil hospital on Sunday after they went on a hunger strike. Some had not even taken dinner on Saturday evening. The protesters included 25 Nanded returnees, who said they had been hospitalised for over 17 days. A 26-year-old resident of Pohir village, Ahmedgarh, said, “We had returned from Hazur Sahib on April 19 and were tested on April 30. On May 1, we tested positive. Many of us have been tested twice and the reports were negative. Those who tested positive should stay back and others should be sent home. We have remained asymptomatic, but were not sent home, according to the new norms.”A 45-year-old woman from Fatehgarh Sahib said, “We faced a lot of problems and became frustrated. Doctors were not discharging us even after 17 days. We went on hunger strike and did not eat anything since morning. They had assured us that we will be sent home after 14 days, but did nothing in that direction. We were not given food on time, accommodation facilities were poor and there was one washroom in a ward full of eight patients. No doctor came to attend symptomatic patients. As we did not require any medication, we should have been sent home.”Civil hospital senior medical officer Dr Geeta Kataria said, “These patients were discharged on Sunday under the new policy. They were not tested before being allowed to go.”
