JAIPUR: A single bench of Rajasthan High Court on Thursday denied bail to a murder accused affected by Covid-19. 

The court said since quarantine and medication facilities are available in jail, there is no need of bail and stated that if he was released, it might affect his relatives and people of his acquaintance. 

The accused through his counsel pleaded in the high court that since he was found to be Covid-19 positive, he should be granted bail. However, the high court denied it.
