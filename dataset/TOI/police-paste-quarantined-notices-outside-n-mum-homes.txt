2020-03-25
NAVI MUMBAI: Navi Mumbai police have pasted notices outside homes of quarantined individuals so that others do not come in contact with them till they complete their isolation period. 

Each notice mentions names of persons who have been home quarantined as well as the telephone number of Navi Mumbai police control room for others to inform them in case the isolated individuals step outside. 

Some photographs of these notices were posted on social media on Tuesday, following which the zonal deputy commissioner of police warned the culprits of stringent legal action. DCP (Zone I) Pankaj Dahane said, “As a pamphlet (notice) mentions the names of quarantined individuals, it should not be circulated on social media. Revealing their identities is illegal and will attract action.”

Meanwhile, a retired government officer from Sanpada complained to the Navi Mumbai police commissioner about a list being circulated on WhatsApp that contains names, addresses and phone numbers of several persons and falsely claims they are Covid-19-positive; it includes his name too. The man said he has abided by a quarantine order after returning from Russia on March 16.
