Lockdown in UP brings some relief to sugar mills, farmers
2020-03-25
BIJNOR: In the wake of the coronavirus scare, UP government has given the nod to relax lockdown norms for sugar mills, distilleries and cane farmers.


Accepting some demands of the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association, UP government has permitted them to procure raw material like sulphur and lime from Rajasthan to process cane into sugar and deliver the products derived from cane to markets.

According to sources, most of the 119 mills in the state had virtually run out of raw material to process 2.5 crore tonnes of yet-to-be harvested standing cane crop. In this context, the sugar association had written to the government, demanding that cane harvesting should continue and labourers be allowed into the fields and sugar mills.

The association pointed out that due to the lockdown, sale of petrol had fallen and so would the sale ethanol. So it sought an increase in the amount of ethanol mixed in petrol from the present 10%. Besides, it would help in preventing accumulation of stocks. In case, the stock is not lifted, the mills would have to shut down their ethanol plants. However, government is yet to take a stand on this matter.

Reacting to governmentâ€™s move, Bijnor district magistrate Ramakant Pandey said mills had been allowed to transport their product and purchase cane at assigned centres and sugar mill gates. Apart from this, labourers would be allowed to harvest the cane and farmers to bring their produce to purchase centres and mill gates.

At the same time, the administration has asked the farmers and labourers to take necessary precautions against the virus while working and transporting cane, raw material, etc. 

According to officials, there are 119 sugar mills here in the state which crush around 70 lakh quintal cane per day. Around 46 lakh farmers supply their produce to these units.
