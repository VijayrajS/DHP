Noida: Four Covid-19 cases with no known source leave doctors guessing
2020-04-13
NOIDA: Health department officials are worried about four patients in the district whose source of infection is still unknown. Their primary and secondary contacts have been quarantined, but the lack of source has prompted officials to raise questions on the possibility of community spreading in the city. 

A 31-year-old shop owner from Ghodi Bacheda village, an 80-year-old woman from a highrise in Noida Extension, a 50-year-old man from Sector 93A and a 67-year-old resident of Sector 50 have tested positive, but they have no recent travel history or any contacts who had gone to a foreign country in the past few weeks. 
Officials said these four patients had travelled to Delhi and might have come in contact with a resident who later tested positive. “We are trying to find the source of their infection. For now, we have put them in the ‘Delhi travellers’ category. For instance, the shop owner from Ghodi Bacheda would regularly visit wholesale markets in Delhi and may have come in contact with an infected person there. At this point, we can’t talk about community spreading since there are only a few cases with an unknown source,” said Dr Devender Varshney from the health department.

GB Nagar, which had sealed 22 hotspots initially, has identified three more after four new cases were reported from these areas in the past two days. The three new areas that have been sealed are Sector 50 and 93A in Noida and Silver City society in Pi 2, Greater Noida. District magistrate Suhas LY said, “All these areas will be sealed till April 14.”
