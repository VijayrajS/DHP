Visakhapatnam: The Eastern Naval Command (ENC) on Saturday stated that no Covid-19 cases have been reported at ENC so far. None of the other commands except Western Naval Command (WNC) in Mumbai — which has reported 26 asymptomatic positive cases among its sailors at INS Angre, one of its shore establishments — has reported any positive cases.

The ENC said it undertook precautionary measures early and any contact with civilian population outside the naval base has been bare minimum. “We started taking precautions at the start of March. Personnel coming from other ports or outside the base were put on a 14-day quarantine and were given clearance to join duty only after they were found healthy. We have not conducted any joint naval exercises since March,” an ENC spokesperson told STOI.

He said everyone wears cloth masks stitched in-house. “For physical fitness, sports or individual level activities are continuing while maintaining social distancing. The ships, submarines, and aircraft cannot be left unmanned and require maintenance. Only the minimum required essential service personnel are on board the ships or at the dockyard,” he added.
