‘Testing protocol under review’
2020-06-08
Ahmedabad: Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health) on Sunday said that they are reviewing the existing protocol for Covid-19 testing and will issue revised guidelines soon.

The state health department faced criticism when the latest rule for Covid-19 testing mandated that a patient must be admitted in a hospital to get his/her testing done. Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) had termed the move as a contempt of court, claiming that the recent Gujarat high court order did not require any such clause.

Talking to media on Sunday, Ravi said the government will publish revised guidelines with modifications.
