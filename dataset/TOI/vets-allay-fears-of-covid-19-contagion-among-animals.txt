Vets allay fears of Covid-19 contagion among animals

VISAKHAPATNAM: Following reports of a tiger testing positive for Covid-19 at the Bronx Zoo in New York, veterinarians in the state have assured pet owners against fears of animals contracting the disease.


“Pet owners just need to follow a few guidelines which are similar to the guidelines prescribed for humans. Don’t allow your pet to go out until and unless it’s very important, wash their paws as much as possible and wash their utensils properly before giving them food or water,” said Raja Gopal, a vet in Visakhapatnam.

Some vets suggest that masks may be used for dogs when their owners take them outside for a walk. “Even if there is a chance of human to animal transfusion, which seems low, a mask would prevent it,” said Raja Gopal.

“There is no instance of pets such as dogs, cats and ornamental fish and even cattle being infected with Covid-19. Normally, coronavirus in animals does not develop into respiratory problems. It creates digestive problems and is curable,” said Rajesh G, a vet in Vizag.

With the lockdown in place, most veterinarians suggest that pet owners keep some generic medicines at home. “For normal times we don’t ask owners to stock medicines. Animals, especially dogs, are adaptive to any situation,” said Makkena Srinu, a vet in Vijayawada.
