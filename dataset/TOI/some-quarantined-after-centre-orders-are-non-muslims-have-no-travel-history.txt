Nagpur: While rounding up and quarantining people as per orders of the home ministry — a fallout of the Tablighi Jamaat meet — the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has found that all are not Muslims. A few have not even toured New Delhi or any other place in the last one month. 

The civic body, with the help of police, has quarantined 104 people in government rest houses in the last two days here. Results of swab samples taken on Wednesday are expected today. 

On Wednesday, the Union government blamed travellers who had attended the Jamaat at a Delhi mosque in February-March for the sudden rise in those testing and dying of Covid-19. 

The Centre had sent a list of names and mobile numbers to state governments which segregated it by districts and then sent it to special branches of the police. The police shared it with the civic bodies. The numbers were identified on the basis of their cell tower location in the are and the period when the Jamaat was held.

The NMC received a list of 68 persons on Tuesday, a copy of which is with TOI. The government note reads: “The need is to trace and quarantine all of them as they are suspected patients. They had come in contact of positive persons of New Delhi.”

The names and address, as registered while the SIMs were purchased, is also mentioned in the list. 

As per the list with NMC, 13 were from rural parts of Nagpur district, two from Pune and one from Yavatmal. The remaining 52 are from city. 

All 52 were traced. Four claimed they had never travelled either to New Delhi or any other place in the last month. Some of the remaining 48 said they had travelled with family members. The NMC quarantined all 54 (48 + 6 members) at the MLA Hostel on Wednesday.

On Wednesday morning, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe in a video release said, “54 who attended the Delhi congregation were traced and quarantined.” In the evening, Mundhe had to change his statement as some of them turned out to be non-Muslims.

A scrutiny of the list of 68 reveals that 37 are non-Muslim names. However, as directed by the Centre, the NMC has quarantined all of them.

TOI spoke to one of the quarantined non-Muslim who is a resident of Civil Lines, a tony locality of Nagpur. “I am a practising Supreme Court lawyer. The SIM card of mobile number mentioned in the list available with the NMC is in the name of my father. When officials came to my house I told them that I am Delhi resident and not my father. So they have quarantined me.”

This lawyer’s office is at the Sunder Nagar Market and residence at Lajpat Nagar in Delhi. “I use the Nizamuddin flyover at least twice a day. I suppose that’s how my number came on the list. I returned to Nagpur on March 18 by air. I had no symptoms in the past and now. Also, its more than 14 days since I returned from New Delhi,” he said.

On Wednesday evening, the NMC received another list of 207 persons from the Centre with directions to trace and quarantine all. Not all are Muslims. A 124 are city residents and the remaining from other parts of the district and state.

The NMC has traced, taken swab samples and quarantined around 50 taking the total to 104. “18 people are untraceable as the numbers are switched off. NMC and police teams are trying to track others,” an NMC official said.

Similarly, the Nagpur Rural Police is tracing people in their jurisdiction. 

As reported by TOI on Thursday, Abdul Bari Patel, the secretary of the Tablighi Markas in Nagpur, only seven members from city attended the international conference in New Delhi. One of them had taken ill and was treated for urinary tract infection and pneumonia. “He was tested for coronavirus and the result was negative,” he said.
