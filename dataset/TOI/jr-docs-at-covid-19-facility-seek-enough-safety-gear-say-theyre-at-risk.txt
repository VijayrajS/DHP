Jr docs at Covid-19 facility seek enough safety gear, say they’re at risk

Agra: Hours after ninth resident of Agra was found Covid-19 positive and was shifted to the isolation facility of S N Medical College, the junior doctors’ association and other medical staff of the college raised demand for personal protection equipment, especially hazmat suits and N95 masks.

According to Dr Bhupendra Singh Chahar, president of junior doctors’ association, “Two teams comprising resident doctors, nursing assistants, ward boys and sanitary workers are simultaneously working at S N Medical College’s Covid-19 facility including one for screening at OPD and the other at the quarantine facility. However, the medical administration has provided personal protection equipment (PPE) only to the quarantine facility team, leaving the other team at OPD vulnerable.”

“In total, 32 PPE, especially hazmat suits, are required in 24 hours – 20 for the quarantine facility and 12 for OPD. But only 12 have been provided to the isolation facility team and none for OPD staff, who screen hundreds of patients every day,” said Dr Chahar.

Hazmat suit, also known as decontamination suit, is a piece of personal protective equipment that consists of an impermeable whole-body garment worn as protection against hazardous materials.

Dr. Chahar added, “We don’t understand when the state administration has provided sufficient funds to buy medical gear, why isn’t college administration buying it? After a lot of persuasion, the college administration provided us 300 N95 masks on Thursday, but our demand for PPE (hazmat suits) is yet to be met.”

College principal Dr G K Aneja refused to comment.

Chief medical officer Dr Mukesh Kumar Vats said, “We are following the government guidelines. There is really no need of PPE for OPD screening. However, on the doctors’ demand, we have given them 50 PPE (hazmat suits).”
