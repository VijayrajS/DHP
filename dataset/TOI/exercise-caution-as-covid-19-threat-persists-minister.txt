Exercise caution as Covid-19 threat persists: Minister
2020-04-14
Thiruvananthapuram: Health minister K K Shailaja urged Keralites to strictly follow the social distancing policy, especially during festival season, as the state is still combating Covid-19 threat. “As we are strictly following quarantine norms, chances are less for a spike in cases. But, caution should continue,” she said.

More people are discharged in state compared to other states. However, it cannot be said that we have reached a safe zone. We have to be more cautious since there is a chance for an increase in the number of cases, she added. 

"Health department is trying to source maximum kits for testing. We want to test people who have the slightest of symptoms. At present, 10 labs are conducting the tests. Though the Centre is providing us the kits, it is insufficient," said the minister. Though there is no concern about the stock of kits, if there is an increase in the number of cases, we will need more kits. Hence we are hoping that things will improve, Shailaja said.

In Kerala, Covid care centres have started functioning. We are providing best available treatment to people and that was the reason why we could discharge more people, including senior citizens. The contact tracing was the best in state, said the minister

Health department received best possible support from the police and local body departments. There is a concern that some cases might have gone unnoticed. Hence, monitoring is continuing in the state. Till date, the success was due to the timely-quarantine of persons who arrived from abroad and tracking those who came in direct contact with patients. 

"The virus spread in other states, especially neighbouring ones, should come down. Then only we can control the spread of the virus in Kerala. Hence, government is waiting for the Centre’s decision on how to relax restrictions imposed as part of the lockdown, she added.
