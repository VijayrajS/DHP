VADODARA: Even as Vadodara city continued to witness a spike in cases of coronavirus, rural areas of Vadodara district have become Covid-free, at least for now.

On Tuesday, a 21-year-old patient got discharged from Parul Sevashram Hospital after her repeat tests came negative.

Vasvi Patel, a resident of nursing quarters of Limda-based hospital, was the last patient from Vadodara rural, who was under treatment.

“We had 11 patients of whom nine recovered while two passed away in the course of their treatment. Currently, there is no patient from Vadodara rural, who is under treatment at any hospital,” said Dr Uday Tilawat, chief district health officer of Vadodara district.

Of the 11 Covid-19 positive cases, two were from nearby Ankodiya village, two from Limda (Waghodiya), three from Dabhoi and one each from Sevasi village, Vasna-Bhayli Road, Padra’s Chokari village and Karjan taluka’s Methi village.

Except the victims from Chokari and Methi villages, all other patients have fully recovered. “A total of 1,046 samples were collected from the rural areas of which 11 had tested positive,” said Tilawat.

On Tuesday, around 59 samples were collected by the health teams, results of which are pending. These included 24 from Vadodara taluka, 15 from Shinor taluka and 10 each from Padra and Dabhoi talukas.

“Based on district collector’s directives, we have started notifying all registered medical practitioners in rural areas as designated Covid consultants,” he said, adding that this will help in providing home-based Covid care if the need arises. There are around 129 private registered medical practitioners in rural areas of the district.
