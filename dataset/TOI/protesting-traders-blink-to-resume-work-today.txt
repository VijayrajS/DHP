2020-02-27
Rajkot: Rajkot market yard will reopen for auction from Thursday. President of the commission agents association, Atul Kamani said, “We have received a message from the chief minister’s office (CMO) asking us to start work from Thursday. The CM has assured us of hearing our grievances after the budget session is over. We will resume work from Thursday.” 

The decision also follows stringent actions taken by the directors and management who locked the office of the association of commission agents and also issued notices to three leaders to surrender their licenses if they do not want to resume normal business in the next three days. 

The market yard committee issued notices to Atul Kamani, Kishor Dunga and Vallabh Pachani. 

Chairman of Rajkot market yard, D K Sakhiya said, “If these people do not want to resume business, new traders are ready to join the market. We cannot harass farmers in this manner.” 

According to sources, traders of the market yard were also divided over the strike as it was getting delayed without any solution in sight to end the stand off. Traders were also losing business as farmers have diverted to other market yards. 

The traders and commission agents have been on strike for the past 10 days demanding solution to mosquito menace in the yard and then withdrawal of police case. After traders clashed with the police on the first day of the strike by pelting stones, a case had been registered against 32 people on charges of rioting.
