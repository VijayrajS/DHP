MADURAI: The Ramanathapuram district administration has placed as many as 151 people, including a former minister under quarantine after they attended the funeral of a 71-year-old man who died of Covid-19.

The man, hailing from Ramanathapuram district had died at the Covid-19 isolation ward of Stanley Hospital in Chennai on April 2. His body was buried in a mosque in Keelakarai in Ramanathapuram on April 3. According to sources, several people, including Ramanathapuram MLA and former IT minister M Manikandan and his father, had attended the funeral as his test results were not known then.

Later, when his test result turned out to be positive, officials from the district administration started to identify those who attended the funeral and asked them to remain in self-quarantine.

Based on a complaint by the village administrative officer, the Keelakarai police registered a case against both sons of the deceased for organising the funeral despite being aware that their father was admitted to the isolation ward. They had also violated the 144 promulgation rules.

They were booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), Section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and Section 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health) of IPC. They were also booked under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and Tamil Nadu Public Health Act.

Speaking to TOI, district collector K Veera Raghava Rao said of the 151 people, 11 are family members of the deceased, while five had performed the rituals during the funeral. All are being closely monitored and swab samples would be taken from them for testing, he added.
