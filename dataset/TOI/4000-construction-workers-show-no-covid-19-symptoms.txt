HYDERABAD: In a heartening development, the 4,000-odd construction workers living at 160 under-construction sites at various places in Greater Hyderabad, have shown no symptoms of coronavirus infection. 

These sites were identified jointly by the labour department, GHMC and revenue officials a fortnight ago. “The special teams of GHMC are monitoring their health condition on a daily basis. So far, there have been no symptoms of coronavirus infection among these workers,” said Gangadhar, deputy commissioner of labour, Hyderabad. The labour department, in consultation with GHMC, is shifting these workers to temporary shelter homes so that they do not have any problems in getting food supplies. The department is also seeking help of NGOs and revenue officials to know the health status of 3.35 lakh migrant workers in the state. There are about 14 lakh construction workers, who are registered with the Labour Welfare Board. 

Meanwhile, CPI and CPM cadres demanded the state government issue directions to labour department to utilise the Labour Welfare Fund and deposit Rs 5,000 each into the accounts of construction workers.
