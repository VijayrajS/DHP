Aurangabad full lockdown extended
2020-05-17
Aurangabad: The Aurangabad city police’s orders of a complete lockdown for three consecutive days starting from Friday was extended by another three days by revenue divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar on Saturday. 

While issuing the orders, Kendrekar directed the district administration, civic body and the Aurangabad city police chief to ensure that the orders are strictly implemented and those unnecessarily stepping out of their homes face action. During the extended lockdown, no markets or other entities are allowed to function. Only pharmacies are exempted. 

Sources said the police authorities too were upset over not being taken into confidence before the orders were issued. “Lockdown is a luxury for the people who have foodgrain in their houses, but for the poor people, it is a punishment,” said a senior police officer, who suggested that there could have been a day’s gap before issuing the fresh lockdown.
