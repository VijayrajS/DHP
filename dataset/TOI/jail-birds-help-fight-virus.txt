Thiruvananthapuram: As the state geared up to fight the spread of Covid-19, the prisons and correctional services department had supported the government by producing two essential safety productsâ€”masks and hand sanitizer.

As many as 2,85,467 masks and 4,468.4 litres of hand sanitizer were manufactured by the prisons and correctional services department till March 31.

Of the masks manufactured by 55 prison units in the state, 22,742 were distributed among members of uniformed forces and members of government department engaged in fighting Covid-19 outbreak, while the remaining 2,62,725 were sold among the public. The prisons department also distributed 2,837.8 litre sanitizer free of cost. 

The prisons were one of the first departments that took the initiative of manufacturing these when the Covid-19 outbreak resulted in immense shortage of these products across the state. 

The prisoners of textile units in Thiruvananthapuram, Viyyur and Kannur central prisons had stopped all the other activities and began producing the face masks from March 13. Later, other prison units too launched mask production. 

The suggestion originally was put forward by social justice department, and after consulting the health department for suggestions and specifications of the masks, the prisons had launched the initiative. The sample for mask production was made available from SAT hospital, and then the department procured the raw material for production. Based on specifications from health department, the inmates of the prisons manufactured the re-usable masks using cotton cloth. In a similar manner, the inmates also ventured into manufacturing hand sanitizers which was in short supply in all the stores across the state. 

The initiatives were lauded from many quarters including the Supreme Court.
