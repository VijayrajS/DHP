Bareilly: The bio-safety laboratory level-3 of the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) here began testing of Covid-19 samples from Thursday. The health department in Bareilly provided the first five human samples. The laboratory was set up in 2011.Till now, the health department had been sending samples to Lucknow for testing. It would take at least 48 hours for the test reports to arrive hereNow, with the IVRI facility, test reports would be available on the same day itself.Officials said the IVRI would test 50 samples a day and may increase it to 150 samples later.RK Singh, director, IVRI, said, “A total of five samples were tested on Thursday and the reports were sent to the chief medical officer (CMO), Bareilly, which is the state nodal office."VK Gupta, joint director, Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnosis (CADRAD) and nodal officer for Covid-19 sample testing at IVRI, said, “The testing of Covid-19 samples began after we received part supply of reagents from the state government and district administration.”Though IVRI on Thursday tested only five samples from Bareilly district, the laboratory here would soon receive samples of suspected cases of novel coronavirus not only from Bareilly but neighbouring districts as well.Sources said state government would soon attach districts with IVRI for testing. Dr Vineet Shukla, CMO, said, “All the five samples tested negative for Covid-19. The testing at IVRI will save time and cost of transportation as we used to send samples to Lucknow by road.”After the spread of novel coronavirus in the country and increasing workload at government laboratories, the Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) permitted IVRI’s laboratory to test human samples for Covid-19. It was decided that state government would provide diagnostic kits and reagents to the institute. The state government attached two microbiologists from the government medical college, Budaun, to IVRI for three months for assisting staff here in sample-testing.Apart from testing human samples for Covid-19 tests, IVRI is one of three institutes identified by the government that would test suspected cases of novel coronavirus among animals.After Bronx zoo in New York reported a case where a human infected a tiger with Covid-19, the government has put zoos, wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves on alert across the country.
