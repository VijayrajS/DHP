Gumla: An 18-year-old migrant, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday night, allegedly violated home quarantine norms for 10 days by playing soccer, gambling and visiting the local haat several times, a panchayat member claimed. District authorities said action will be taken against the youth, if the claim is verified.

The infected youth hailed from Patratoli village of Basua panchayat here. After he was found positive, authorities sent him to a Covid hospital on Friday but locals feared that he could have infected many more.

Amar Oraon, a panchayat member, said, “After the youth returned from Gujarat on his own on May 23, he directly went home instead of getting himself screened. The following day, he went to the district headquarters for a check-up but returned on May 26 from a quarantine centre on the pretext of getting clothes from home.”

Gumla DC Shashi Ranjan said the youth was advised home quarantine. “He was home quarantined while his samples were sent for testing. If he had violated home quarantine norms, we will certainly take action after verification,” Ranjan said.

He added that samples of 16 others with whom he had come in direct contact have tested negative. “We are in the process of sanitising 68 houses in the locality and a survey of suspects are on,” the DC added. So far, 27 Covid-19 cases have surfaced from Gumla of which 10 have recovered.
