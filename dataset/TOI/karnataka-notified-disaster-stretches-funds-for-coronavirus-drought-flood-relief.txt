BENGALURU: The Centre’s decision to declare Covid-19 a ‘notified disaster’ means the state government must use the State Disaster Response Fund to fight it.

This may result in Karnataka falling short of funds for flood victims of North Karnataka and natural disasters in the upcoming fiscal. The 2019 floods that hit 22 districts of Karnataka caused a damage of Rs 34,000 crore. With the Centre releasing only Rs 1,870 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and Rs 300 crore from SDRF, the funds were insufficient.

 
 
The 15th Finance Commission recommended an SDRF of Rs 1,054 crore for Karnataka for 2020-21, of which the Centre’s share is Rs 791 crore.

With norms suggesting only 80 per cent can be utilised for handling natural calamities (20 per cent as mitigation fund), the state may spend up to Rs 640 crore on operations to contain Covid-19, including setting up quarantine camps and special treatment for patients. This may impact ongoing rehabilitation works for last year’s floods victims.

According to Veeresh Sobaradmath, president, Raitha Sena, only 30 per cent of 1.25 lakh households have got financial assistance for house repairs and a proposal to shift 100 villages is on paper.

The executive committee on natural disaster management will meet on Monday. “While adequate funds are available for both flood relief and Covid-19, we’ll approach the Centre for more funds if needed,” said chief secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar.

However, questions are being raised on why National Health Mission funds are not utilised to fight the pandemic. The Centre has allocated Rs 69,234 crore for NHM, of which Rs 34,115 crore has been marked for states.

“The NHM funds are substantial and the need to use SDRF may not arise. If needed, we’ll seek additional funds under NHM and not SDRF,” said medical education minister K Sudhakar.
