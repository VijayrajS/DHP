AHMEDABAD: A 3.5-year-old girl from Saraspur area of Ahmedabad city was the youngest among the 14 victims of Covid-19 reported on Saturday within city municipal limits. She succumbed to the disease at SVP hospital on Saturday. Eight of the 14 victims whose deaths were reported on Saturday had no co-morbidities. Except for a 30-year-old man from Jamalpur rest of the victims were all aged above 40 years. 

In western Ahmedabad, an 81-year-old man from Naranpura railway crossing area had succumbed to the disease. Of the 14 victims, six had spent only three to five days in hospital. 

One 65-year-old man who had no co-morbidities had only spent a day at Sola civil hospital. Sources claim that the victim had come at a critical state to the hospital. 

“People still consider reporting the disease as a last resort. Till then, they try to treat the disease at home or prefer to go to the general physician instead of testing early,” said a Sola civil hospital doctor. Most of the victims belonged to Bapunagar, India colony, Saraspur Rakhial, Jamalpur, Vatva, Indrapuri, Danilimda and Shahpur. 

Among the co-morbities that were reported were hypertension, diabetes, asthma and kidney disease.
