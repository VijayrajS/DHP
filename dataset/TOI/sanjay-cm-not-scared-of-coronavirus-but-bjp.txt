Addressing BJP cadre at state party office, Sanjay declared a war against TRS government, saying he would be a nightmare for the regime and KCR in the next three years.

He announced that he would visit every corner of the state. “I will do walkathons and rath yatra too. I will visit every mandal and district in the state,” he added. 

Sanjay said that he was not scared of anyone, jail and lathis would not be enough to punish BJP activists henceforth. He dared CM to accompany him to Delhi. “I will get funds for the state. Does he have the courage? He (KCR) is levelling false allegations against the Centre,” he added.

Sanjay said CM was not interested in controlling coronavirus. “He is only interested in getting funds related to coronavirus measures from the Centre. He claims in the assembly that paracetamol can treat coronavirus, but his intention is only getting funds.” he added.
