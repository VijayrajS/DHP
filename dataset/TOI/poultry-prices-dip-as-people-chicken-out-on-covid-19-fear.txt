HYDERABAD: Days after health minister Eatala Rajender said poultry industry suffered Rs 1,000 crore loss due to virus scare and urged people to not worry about eating chicken, prices continue to plummet. On Saturday, price of skinless broiler chicken dropped to Rs 50 per kg. Just five days ago — on March 10 — the rate was Rs 100.

There has been no let-up in the trend of falling prices, which started in February. Chicken rate in first week of March stood at Rs 120. Before the rumours about the virus spreading through consumption of chicken started, the price ranged between Rs 180 and Rs 200 per kg. 

Poultry association members said price of live bird ranged between Rs 12 and Rs 17 per kg on Saturday. “The loss is mounting steeply and we are not sure when the business will be back on track,” said Chakradhar Rao, president of Indian Poultry Equipment Manufacturers Association.

President of Telangana Poultry Federation Errabelli Pradeep Kumar Rao said poultry farmers were the worst affected. “We left no stone unturned to fight the rumours spreading on social media regarding consumption of chicken. We have even a organised chicken mela in Hyderabad with minister KT Rama Rao taking a bite of chicken piece. But, our efforts have gone in vain,” he said.

When STOI contacted owners of chicken retail stores, they said consumers stopped eating chicken owing to the virus fear. “They strongly believe in rumours about coronavirus being spread through chicken. They do not want to take any chance,” said a staffer at a supermarket in Panjagutta.
