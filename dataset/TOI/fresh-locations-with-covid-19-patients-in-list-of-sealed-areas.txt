2020-06-03
Pune: The civic body on Tuesday made major changes to the list of containment clusters in the city by adding 28 new localities — mostly in Hadapasar, Parvati, Satara Road, Shivajinagar and Kothrud — and excluding 27 not recording any Covid-19 cases over the past 15 days.The number of containment clusters in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits is 66 now — one more than 65, declared on May 19. Only essential shops will remain open in these areas from 9am to 2pm.The changes in sealed areas are in tune with Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad’s statement on Monday that 1,450 fresh cases were reported from areas outside the previous containment zones.Kothrud, relatively free from the virus concern, now has three containment clusters. Shivajinagar is also emerging as an area of concern. Gaikwad told TOI on Tuesday, “The civic administration reviewed the areas and positive cases reported over the last fortnight. New areas have been added as many cases have come up there.”According to the PMC order on Tuesday, the first phase of unlock will start on June 3, the second on June 5 and the third on June 8. In the first phase, private and municipal gardens will be opened from 5am to 7pm. In the second phase, all marketplaces barring malls and commercial complexes will be opened following the odd and even system. Places like Mahatma Phule Mandai, Hong Kong lane and Tulsibaug will remain open from 9am to 5pm. The use of trial rooms has been prohibited. In the third, private offices can function with 10% staff.On Tuesday, the PMC reduced the mandatory distance between two hawkers from 10m to 5m. The usage of masks, hand sanitizer and gloves will be mandatory.
