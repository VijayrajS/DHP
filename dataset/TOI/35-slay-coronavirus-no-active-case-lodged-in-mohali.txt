MOHALI: As many as 35 Covid-19 patients were discharged in a single day on Friday, the highest so far in a development that prompted civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh to announce that Mohali has no active case now. 

As many as 95 of the 105 total cases in the district have recovered. Three patients had died. The civil surgeon said the remaining seven active cases, while being from Mohali, are under isolation at Patiala (2), Ludhiana (3) and Ropar (2). Discharged patients belong to different parts of the district. Out of these, the civil surgeon said 22 are Sikh pilgrims who had returned from Hazoor Sahib, Nanded, Maharashtra, nine are from Jawaharpur and four from Nayagaon. 

The civil surgeon said that according to the revised discharge guidelines that were issued by the Punjab health department, Covid-19 patients who display no symptoms of the disease for 10 days of admission to a Covid care facility can be discharged from a hospital. 

The recovered patients thanked the doctors and other staff. Besides quality treatment, they said their needs of food and drink were also taken care of. They appealed to people not to be scared of the illness and take good diet and precautions. 

The civil surgeon also appealed to people not to leave their homes and go out only in case of urgent need. He asked them to visit hospitals in case of serious problems only. Instead of going to hospitals, he said they could call on the health department's helpline number 104 for expert advice. He also asked people to wash their hands frequently and maintain distance from each other. District epidemiologist Dr Renu Singh and Dr Harmandeep Kaur were also present on the occasion.
