Coronavirus: How to make a mask?
2020-04-06
The outbreak of coronavirus across the globe has led to a shortage of face masks and sanitizers. If you are looking for a mask and can't get it in the market, you can always make one at home. 

Here's a step-by-step guide to make masks at home that are washable as well as reusable. 

 


Things to keep in mind:


 A homemade mask should have multiple layers of fabric that can be machine or hand washed without getting damaged
 Thicker fabric is better as it can offer greater protection â€” a heavy cotton T-shirt, for example, can also be cut into a mask
 You must ensure that the fabric is washed well in boiling water for 5 minutes and dried well, before you make the mask. Adding salt to this water is recommended
 If you are using a bandanna or handkerchief, fold it over twice or thrice before wearing
 Just wearing the mask is not important, it is also important how you wear it. Ensure that the masks fits around your mouth and nose and there is no gap between your face and mask. When wearing the mask, the side facing you should show pleats downwards. Never-ever reverse the mask for reuse
 
It is critical to emphasize that aside from wearing masks, maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.
