NAGPUR: The detection of a Covid-19 positive patient from another locality has necessitated the need for an immediate containment drive there. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), however, has postponed the diagnosis of 12 passengers who were in bogies of the trains in which the Khamla businessman and manager (both of whom tested positive) travelled between Nagpur and New Delhi.


The NMC had planned to do testing of all 12 passengers — who are residents of the city — and adjacent towns like Narkhed, Kamptee etc on Sunday at GMCH.

“We are in regular contact with these 12 persons. They do not have any symptoms. In case any of them exhibits some symptoms, we will get them tested,” Dr Bhavna Sonkusre, NMC additional medical officer (health) told TOI.

In all, 64 persons were in bogies of the two trains. The remaining 52 are from different districts of Vidarbha and other states. The NMC had alerted collectors and chief secretaries of respective districts and states.
