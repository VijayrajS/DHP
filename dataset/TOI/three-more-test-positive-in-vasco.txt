VASCO: Three persons from the port town, including a priest, tested Covid positive on Friday.

The priest resides in the same premises along with the priest who had tested positive on Thursday, while the other two patients are members of a church body.

While eight people who were in contact with the priest had been tested on Thursday at the sub district hospital at Chicalim, swabs of 14 others were sent for testing on Friday. So far, four people have tested negative. The test results of two councillors who had been in contact with the priest were also negative.

The results of 30 samples belonging to 68 staffers of the Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) were reported negative on Friday. Thirty samples had earlier also tested negative. The MMC staffers had undergone testing after a woman who serves them tea had been found positive.

Meanwhile, the vegetable and fruit markets in Vasco will reopen from Saturday. However, the MMC chairperson has warned that if a rush is witnessed in market then he will take help from the police to regulate the crowd. The vendors had extended support to the call given by MMC chief Nandadeep Raut for a voluntary lockdown.
