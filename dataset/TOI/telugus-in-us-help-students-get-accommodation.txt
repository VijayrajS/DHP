HYDERABAD: With restrictions being imposed across US, the Telugu Association of North America (TANA) has helped 24 students find accommodation after their universities asked them to leave campus accommodation. These include students from Ohio, Atlanta and California.


Ashok Kolla, chairman TEAM Square of the Telugu Association of North America (TANA), said, “The stranded students have been put up in motels run by Indians free of cost. Also, a few Indian families have come forward to take them in.”

Telugu-origin Rao Maddukkuri, whose son, Akhil is in the third year of his undergraduate course at Stanford University said the officials had advised international students to leave, but those who could not were being allowed to stay on.
