Aurangabad: Two days after a tiger tested positive for Covid-19 at Bronx the zoo in New York, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) took note and got the Siddharth Garden zoo staff and tigers screened for the respiratory disease on Tuesday.

According to National Veterinary Services Laboratories, the New York incident is the first known case of Covid-19 transmission from humans to a non-domesticated animal.

Earlier, researchers from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China had found that cats are also susceptible to contracting coronavirus, but could not establish if humans could get infected from the felines.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele on Tuesday said that in order to ensure that such transmission does not take place at the AMC-run zoo, the screening of all the officials and workers was carried out by AMC’s health department.

“None of the staff was found with any symptoms, travel history or contact with any Covid-19 positive patient,” Ghodele said.

The AMC, under the supervision of zoo director Bhagwat Naikwade, also called a veterinarian (Neeti Singh) to check the health of the tigers. “There are 10 tigers at the zoo and their body temperature, diet and breathing were found to be normal,” Ghodele said.

“However, the veterinarian has instructed the staff to ensure that proper precautions are taken while feeding the animals. The staff has been asked to wear gloves, gumboots and masks while feeding or going close to the animals,” he added.

The mayor also appealed to the citizens to not believe or spread rumours. “The civic administration, district collector and the divisional commissioner along with the health machinery are taking all precautions to manage and contain the spread of the virus,” he said.
