PATNA: Bihar’s migrant workers, who have returned to the state amid the Covid lockdown, have accounted for an alarming 72% of the cases recorded in the past 20 days. 


The number of patients with novel coronavirus symptoms has doubled to 2,166 in just one week. The figure was 1,000 on May 15.

According to information shared on Friday by the Bihar Health Society, so far 1,184 migrants have tested positive for the virus since May 3.

Bihar reported its first three coronavirus cases on March 22. Thereafter, the state reported a steady increase in the numbers which touched 400 on April 29. On May 3, the state reported 517 coronavirus cases.

However, the number shot up by 1,649 between May 3 and May 22 with the returning migrant workers testing positive for the virus. So far, 333 migrant workers from Delhi, 293 from Maharashtra and 212 from Gujarat have tested positive.

With large number of migrants testing positive for Covid-19, the state health department has now classified the regions from where they are coming back into three categories. Delhi, Gujarat and Maharsahtra have been kept in category ‘A’, others with lesser cases in category ‘B’ and those with minimum or no cases in category ‘C’.

The state has 2,344 beds in three dedicated hospitals for the treatment of coronavirus cases. Apart from these, there are 7,769 beds in care centres and health centres dedicated to Covid patients. An official said the state has capacity to accommodate 15,000 patients as of now. “If the need arises, quarantine centres will also be used for the purpose. Since most positive cases are asymptomatic, they do not need to be admitted in hospitals,” the official added.
