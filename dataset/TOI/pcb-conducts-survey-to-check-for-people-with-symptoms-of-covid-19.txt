2020-03-24
PUNE: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) on Monday launched a door-to-door survey to identify suspected coronavirus patients in its limit.


It has formed eight teams. Each team comprises a nurse, a counsellor and a doctor. They will visit the populated areas of the cantonment. 

“We get a list of foreign visitors from the district administration daily. Our teams visit those families and check their health. People with symptoms are immediately put under home quarantine. So far, about 20 people are in home quarantine and their health is being monitored daily by our health teams,” chief executive officer Amit Kumar told TOI. 

Surveyors will collect information from each family member and submit it to the district administration daily. 

"The survey of bungalow areas has been completed. No patient was found in the drive," resident medical officer VD Gaikwad of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital said. 

The health department is fumigating the cantonment areas and has started an awareness drive. On Monday, the Cantonment police station and the board officials closed down shops, including bakeries, across the cantonment as a precautionary measure to contain the virus. 

On Monday, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market and vegetable markets in Ghorpadi and Kumbhar Bawdi were open to the public. These establishments were closed on Saturday and Sunday. 

Residents, activists and board members felt these places should open only twice or thrice a week considering the prevailing situation in the city.
