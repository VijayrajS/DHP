She even performed an operation a couple of days ago and the patient had developed coronalike symptoms.

As the news was received by authorities, a team from health department went to the nursing home. They vacated rest of the admitted patients, barring the one who was operated along with both the doctors.

“We have sealed the entire premises and put both the doctors and the patient under quarantine. We have also asked the nursing staff to go under self-quarantine. We have also sent the blood samples of all the three for investigation,” the CMO said.
