Jaisalmer: Around the time when cases of Covid-19 started increasing in the country, a 17-member group of Tablighi Jamaat arrived here from Delhi on March 17 and took part in programmes held at a few mosques. The group had arrived in the district on February 26 before heading to Jaisalmer three weeks later. The group went to Pokhran on March 19. Though no case of coronavirus has been reported here, the visit of this group has alerted the local intelligence officials, security agencies and the district administration. Jaisalmer SP Kiran Kang confirmed that the group came from Delhi in mid-March. “They went to various areas of Sadar police station. We are trying to find out the places they visited. We have received information about them going to Pokhran from Jaisalmer,” Kang said on Tuesday.According to official sources, the group had started a 40-day tour to various parts of the country and was in Jaisalmer on March 17 during which they visited few religious places and mosques and took part in programmes in which dozens of people were present. Sources said when CID and other intelligence agencies got information about the group going to different places in the city without permission, they objected to it following which the group left for Pokhran the next day. Reportedly, the group stayed in Pokhran and took part in some programmes and when security agencies got information, they were asked to leave Pokhran as well. After this, their last local movement was found at a few places in Jodhpur division. Sources said till now, there is no information about them, but intelligence and security agencies are trying to trace the members. Since the virus shows symptoms after a few days, therefore local administration and security agencies are worried and are trying to collect more details.
