2020-05-23
MUMBAI: Maharashtra reported 2,940 Covid-19 cases on Friday, its highest addition in a day so far and the highest jump for any state, taking the total in the state to 44,582. 

 


 This is the sixth day in a row the state has added over 2,000 cases. Maharashtra also reported 63 deaths, taking the Covid-19 toll so far to 1,517. 

Health minister Rajesh Tope admitted that cases were increasing and said the focus was on reducing deaths. "We have issued orders to make available 80% of beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients and have capped treatment rates. We have invoked five Acts under which action can be taken if this order is not followed. I urge private hospitals to follow the norms issued by the state government," Tope said. 

The city's toll breached the 900 mark even as cases continued to rise by over a thousand for the sixth consecutive day. On Friday, 1,751 cases - the highest single-day rise - were registered. The only silver lining was that it recorded 27 deaths as against 41 on the two preceding days, taking the toll to 909.
