PharmD pupils offer help for non-Covid cases
2020-04-01
Aurangabad: The students and graduates of the six-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) course have sent a letter to the state and the central health ministries seeking permission to provide healthcare to those patients suffering from ailments other than Covid-19. 

The health machinery of the country is under immense pressure, compelling the doctors and physicians to work day in and day out for the prevention and management of the pandemic. 

In letters emailed to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and state public health minister Rajesh Tope on March 28, National Doctor of Pharmacy Association’s president Ramprasad Nagare has stated that while all health machinery is focussed on Covid-19, questions arise on the care given to patients suffering from other ailments. 

“In the rural and underdeveloped communities and in areas plagued by shortage of physicians, pharmacists may be the only healthcare provider who is immediately accessible to patients. Empowering clinical pharmacists to play a bigger role in ambulatory care and emergency triage could allow physicians to focus on the more acutely ill,” stated Nagare in the letters.

“There are 42,700 students in different states enrolled in the programme and 29,700 PharmD qualified persons across India,” he said.
