Curbs eased, govt eyes aggressive Covid-19 testing
2020-05-28
NEW DELHI: At a time when the country is gradually exiting the national lock down and there is still no treatment or vaccination for Covid-19, the government has decided to go for aggressive testing to check for any wider spread of the disease and gather more information on locality specific characteristics, official sources said.


Officials indicated multiple strategies for detection and implementation of physical distancing measures will be key components going forward with the health ministry, empowered committees, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the national task force on the disease working on how the testing net should be cast wider.

An important part of the thinking in government centres around ensuring testing facilities are available and accessible across the country, even in remote areas which are of late witnessing increased influx of migrant workers and may see more Covid-19 cases.

At present, India has a testing capacity of over 1.4 lakh samples per day but the Council is working to ramp it up to two lakh daily. Till Wednesday, India had tested over 32.42 lakh samples with 1,16,041 samples tested in last 24 hours.

“We have told states to ramp up testing as much as possible. Testing is a key tool to ensure cases are detected early and referred for clinical management. This will not only help reduce deaths but also enable early contact tracing and check a wider spread,” a senior official in the health ministry said. The government has already begun a serological survey of low and high risk individuals and is keeping a close tab on incidence of patients with respiratory problems in hospitals.

The government has also asked private labs to step up testing and the ICMR has removed the Rs 4,500 price cap allowing states to negotiate prices with private labs to lower them further. “The idea is to make tests more accessible and affordable through private labs. So far, testing in the private sector has not picked up much,” another official said.

According to officials, increased testing in last few weeks have shown detection of more cases even as fatality rate has remained under control and recovery rate is growing and is now 42.4%. The fatality rate is 2.86% whereas the world average is 6.36%.

“Testing also provides insights into the spread of the disease and its evolving and locality specific characteristics. As countries phase-out lock downs and restart their respective economies, testing seems to be the most powerful measure to ensure safety of the citizens in a post-lockdown world,” says Kriti Kapur, a health fellow at ORF.

Kapur said given the large population base, India’s test per million population remains very low, even as with increased testing, India has also witnessed an increase in the percentage of positive infections pointing to a larger asymptomatic spread.
