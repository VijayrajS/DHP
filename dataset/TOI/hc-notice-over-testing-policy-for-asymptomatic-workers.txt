Gujarat high court notice over testing policy for asymptomatic workers
2020-06-10
AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued notice to the state government in response to a petition filed by the Indian Medical Association, challenging the policy of requiring prior approval from the government authority to test asymptomatic frontline health workers for Covid-19.


The policy has been questioned seeking RT-PCR tests for doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, pharmacists and other supporting staff of medical colleges, hospitals, clinics and working in containment or micro-containment zones. On June 2, the state government amended its policy and made prior approval from the medical authority mandatory for asymptomatic persons who want to get Covid-19 tests done, not in accord with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. Later, the government also introduced hospitalization as a pre-requisite for Covid-19 testing.

A bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice N V Anjaria issued notice to the state government and ICMR and sought their responses by June 19 to the association’s petition to scrap the June 2 government policy for frontline healthcare workers. The association’s advocate, Mitul Shelat submitted that not testing a doctor or frontline health workers without government approval could prove detrimental to the health of the doctor as well as patients. For proper functioning of a doctor in this time of pandemic, it is necessary for him and for others to know about his Covid-19 status.

When Shelat pressed for urgency in the matter, the bench permitted him to mention it before the chief justice for early hearing. The bench of the chief justice and Justice J B Pardiwala while hearing the suo motu PIL on Covid-19 and the lockdown had posed a pertinent question to the state government and sought its reply on June 19 on whether it is an Indian citizen’s fundamental right to get himself tested for Covid-19 or for any diagnosis. This question was asked when the state government insisted that it did not intend to deviate from ICMR guidelines restricting the testing of asymptomatic persons.

Health workers are at higher risk of catching the infection. With the testing policy in place today, more than 200 doctors have been infected with Covid-19 and a few of them even succumbed to it. A very high number of nurses and paramedics are also infected with the virus, making them super spreaders. The insistence on quashing the testing policy for health workers is to minimize the risk to health workers and other persons.
