Andhra Pradesh: N Chandrababu Naidu takes ‘essential services’ route to skip home quarantine
2020-05-28
AMARAVATI: TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu’s decision to skip home quarantine advisory issued by the government is creating ripples in political circles.


Naidu attended Mahanadu programme in Mangalagiri on Wednesday. Naidu, who was stranded in Hyderabad for about two months, reached home in Undavalli only two days ago.

“Naidu has clearly violated the guidelines stipulated in the pass. We are looking into the issue,” a cabinet minister told TOI, who does not wish to be quoted.

Naidu and Lokesh should have stayed at home at least for one-week as per the revised guidelines of the Centre on Covid-19 management as they have travelled from other state. The state government has been sending all those coming from other states either to institutional quarantine or paid quarantine. The government is granting home quarantine facility in health emergency and special cases.

Sources said that Naidu had secured travel pass from Telangana police under ‘stranded persons’ category and applied for pass from the AP police under ‘essential services’ category apparently to skip the quarantine rules.

“While all the stranded people have to apply through Spandana portal, we are issuing special passes to two categories--health emergencies and essential services. Naidu got the pass under the essential services category despite knowing that he doesn’t belongs to it,” confirmed a police official.

Sources said that mandatory Covid-19 screening was not conducted on Naidu and Lokesh while entering the state from Hyderabad keeping in view of the sensitiveness of the issue. “We have requested Naidu to follow the Covid-19 guidelines,” DGP Gautham Sawang told TOI.
