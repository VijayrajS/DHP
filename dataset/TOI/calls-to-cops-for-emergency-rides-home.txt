Lockdown in Noida: Calls to cops for emergency rides home
2020-03-28
NOIDA: With the lockdown in place, women — particularly those residing alone in paying guest (PG) facilities — are dialling 112 or taking to Twitter to seek help from police for emergency commute.


Pragya, an IT professional, was left alone in the Grih Pravesh housing society in Sector 77 after both her roommates left home. She reached out to the Noida police, seeking their help to reach Rajasthan border from where she could travel to Jaipur, her hometown, to visit her sick mother.

Sector 49 station officer Dharmendra Sharma told TOI that the police dropped her to the Rajasthan border in Gurgaon.

However, an engineer couple from Nagina, who are stuck in Noida’s Sector 12, are yet to get any help. They took to Twitter to seek help to return to their native place to be with their breastfeeding baby girl.

“I went to my hometown Nagina last week with my breastfeeding child. My wife and I returned to Noida to get the laptops from our offices to work from home. All of a sudden, the lockdown was imposed and we are both have stuck here. My daughter needs us. Please help us to get back,” Vishal Verma, the girl’s father, wrote, tagging Noida police commissioner, Dial 112, Noida police, UP Police and UP CM.

His wife, Vaishnavi, tweeted: “Please help us to get back to our daughter. My daughter is crying for me and I'm helpless at this time.”

On the other hand, the elderly too have been dialing 112 in case they need essential items in emergency. A woman in her seventies who stays alone in Beta II area called up the emergency number to inform that she was staying alone.

Beta II station officer Sujeet Upadhayay said that medicines were provided to the woman by the police as her relatives are in Gurugram.
