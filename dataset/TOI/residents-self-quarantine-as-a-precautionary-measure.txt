DEHRADUN: Residents of Shivalik Luxury Apartment situated at Raipur road have self-quarantined themselves as a precautionary measure against coronavirus and are trying their best to avoid visitors. The flat owners alleged that a garbage pile outside their apartment is a health hazard and its removal is all the more crucial in view of the Covid-19 threat.


Talking to TOI, Colonel P Goyal, a resident, said, “The space outside the apartments was left for provision of road widening as per the MDDA guidelines. We didn’t expect that people from the vicinity would start dumping garbage here. We had recently requested the mayor, Sunil Uniyal Gama, to resolve our problem, after which the area was partially cleaned.”

In the past, the flat owners had also installed barbed wires to deter people from dumping garbage but soon the wires and the pillars were stolen. VV Bhatt, a resident, said, “The garbage pile has been there unattended for long. With no choice, we have decided to keep ourselves inside our homes to avoid any possible infection. We just hope the DMC removes this dump in the wake of Covid-19 spread.”

To add to the woes of the residents, the site of the garbage dump has been encroached by illegally parked vehicles. Kishan Pal, sanitation inspector in the area, said, “We had recently cleaned the dump outside the apartment. Since the higher officials at the DMC are monitoring the cleaning drive, the site will be cleaned again.”
