2020-03-23
Thiruvananthapuram: There is uncertainty over the death of a 58-year-old Poovar man, who had recently returned from UAE. On Sunday, doctors at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital collected swab samples from the body and sent them for testing for coronavirus infection. The man had died on Saturday afternoon after he collapsed at his residence. He was under self-isolation at home.

MCH superintendent M S Sharmad said the test is being carried out as he had returned from a Covid-19-affected region. If the test returns negative, the body of the deceased will be handed over to the family for funeral. But, if the result is positive, hospital authorities will cremate the body following protocols.

According to police, the deceased reportedly fell from the staircase, injuring his forehead, at around 3.30pm on Saturday. Though he was rushed to the primary health centre at Vizhinjam, doctors declared him dead on arrival.

Cops are still unclear whether the deceased fell from the staircase owing to illness or as the result of a mishap. Though the body was shifted to MCH mortuary for postmortem, health department authorities put off the examination and are awaiting the test result.

Police said that as per their inquiry, the deceased had not displayed any symptoms of infection on arrival and was sent home from the airport after initial screening. He was also advised to go into self-isolation at home, which he followed.
