Telangana: Imams and muezzins not paid since beginning of lockdown
2020-05-21
HYDERABAD: With no congregational prayers in the last two months and thus no weekly or monthly contributions by devotees, managements of mosques are struggling for funds. Ramzan is the period when mosques get additional donations which are passed on to Imams, muezzins and other staff. Several Imams and Muezzins have also complained of non-receipt of monthly financial aid from the state.


A survey covering about 100 mosques located in middle income and low-income group localities in the city revealed that Imams and muezzins lead a hand-to-mouth existence and the lockdown has only aggravated their condition. Many have not been paid salaries for the past two months. “Imams and muezzins are a financially vulnerable group. With mosques closed, all traditional forms of fund raising have completely dried up,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, managing trustee of Helping Hand Foundation, which conducted the survey.

Askari said the staff of mosques located in rural areas are the worst affected as they have little access to the devout, who make Zakat and Sadaqa donations in Ramzan. The average salary of Imam, mostly Hafiz, responsible for conducting five obligatory prayers and leading Friday prayers, is in the range of Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000. Muezzin, who assists the Imam in making Azan five times a day and responsible for cleaning and maintenance of the mosque, is paid between Rs 5,000 and Rs 8000.
