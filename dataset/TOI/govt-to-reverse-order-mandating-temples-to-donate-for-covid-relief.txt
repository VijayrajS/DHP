Govt to reverse order mandating temples to donate for Covid relief
2020-05-05
Chennai: Bowing to public opposition, the Tamil Nadu government has dropped its April 24 circular asking 47 big temples in the state to contribute their ‘surplus funds’ to chief minister’s relief fund for Covid-19 relief measures.

The state government informed the Madras high court on Monday that it decided to withdraw the circular mandating temples managed by the Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department to contribute substantial amount from their surplus fund to the chief minister relief fund.

The submission came after a PIL filed by R R Gopaljee, publisher of Tamil daily Dinamalar, came up for hearing before a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana.

“The circular is likely to be withdrawn and the department is not insisting on any such contribution from temples,” HR&CE department’s counsel M Karthikeyan, said to the bench.

Recording the submission, the judges said: “Therefore, the matter is adjourned to May 8 and on that day, Karthikeyan may produce the relevant order passed by the commissioner of the department in this regard withdrawing the circular. In the meanwhile, the department shall not act upon the circular, against the temples included in the said circular.”

According to Gopaljee, the HR&CE commissioner had illegally issued a circular directing the temples in the categories specified to mandatorily contribute substantial amount from their surplus fund to the chief minister public relief fund. “The commissioner has no authority to issue such a circular and mandate compulsory contribution. Temples have been closed for two months and there is no flow of revenue,” he said.
