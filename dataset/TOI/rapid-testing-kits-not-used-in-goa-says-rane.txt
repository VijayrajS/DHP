PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Wednesday said no rapid test kits have been used in the state of Goa.

“Not a single rapid testing kit has been used from the government of India. They’re sealed and in the possession of the government and haven’t been used at all because we already had our testing kits at the virology lab. There is already a government order for a lakh of kits,” Rane told mediapersons on Wednesday.

The government is also procuring a new machine which will allow 1,500-2,000 Covid tests to be conducted in a day at the virology lab, he said, adding that ventilators are also being procured in various phases.

The state government has ordered 1,500 thermal guns, of which 1,000 have already arrived and are being distributed by various secretaries, he said.

As far as the Covid-19 community survey is concerned, the standard protocol is being decided by the health secretary, based on which people will be tested, Rane said.

A smart kiosk is being installed at Mormugao Port Trust to intensify testing facilities for seafarers before they exit the port.

Rane said 12 kiosks are being set up in hotspots in the state where swab samples will be tested. “Industries have started. Swabs have to be taken. We have to lean to live within Covid-19, but within certain parameters,” the health minister said.

The kiosk is equipped with temperature guns, replaceable gloves, sanitising dispenser and sample drop- box (ice box) and will permit spot testing.
