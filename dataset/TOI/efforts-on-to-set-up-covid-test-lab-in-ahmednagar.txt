Nashik: Ahmednagar district guardian minister Hassan Mushrif said he has requested the state government to set up a Covid-19 testing laboratory in the district.

Addressing the media at Ahmednagar district headquarters on Thursday, Mushrif said if a lab becomes operational, the swab test reports would be available to the administration faster.

“The entire government machinery has done well to control the spread of the infection in the district. People in the district too must be complimented for extending support by remaining indoors during the lockdown,” added the guardian minister.

Mushrif said if any migrant worker returns to the district from any other part of the country, he would be quarantined for 14 days.

District officials said his tests after treatment were negative. With this recovery, a total of 26 patients have recovered and 16 are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
