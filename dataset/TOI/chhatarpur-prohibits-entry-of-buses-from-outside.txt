BHOPAL: Following reports of four positive cases of coronavirus in Jabalpur, the collector of Chhatarpur has prohibited the entry of passenger buses from Jabalpur, Delhi and the neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh. Sheelendra Singh, the district collector, issued the orders in this regard.

There are three suspected cases of coronavirus infection in the district and all of them have been quarantined in the district hospital at Chhatarpur. Incidentally, a large number of people travel from Chhatarpur to Jabalpur, about 240 kilometres away for a variety of reasons, including cases related to the high court.

Also, a large number of labourers from different districts of Bundelkhand region migrate on a regular basis not only to Delhi, but also to the bigger cities of the neighbouring UP for work. Many of them are now returning home after lockdown in cities such as Agra and Delhi, district administration sources said.

Meanwhile, there are three suspected cases of Covid-19 in Chhatarpur, one of them returned from Germany, the other from Dubai, while the third suspected carrier is a labourer by profession.

“Those who had returned from abroad were quarantined for 14 days and their test reports were found to be negative. All of them have been discharged,” said civil surgeon Dr R S Tripathi. He said that a labourer from Hinauta village is still undergoing treatment at the hospital.

“After he was seen sneezing at a farm field while cutting crops, the villagers beat him up and he was rushed to the hospital. He was sneezing because of inhaling some crop residues, but the villagers insisted that he was suffering from coronavirus,” Dr Tripathi added. “Though he was quarantined, he will be discharged tomorrow”, he said.
