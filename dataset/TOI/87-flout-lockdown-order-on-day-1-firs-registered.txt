LUCKNOW: After violation of lockdown orders were reported in the city on Monday, district authorities announced measures to restrict movement of people from Tuesday.


No pillion riders will be allowed on two-wheelers and people attending offices have been asked to go straight to their workplace from home and vice versa. Moreover, if a person is moving out for medical emergency, he should carry relevant papers to explain his stand.
