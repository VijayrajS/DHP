GREATER NOIDA: Migrant workers in the city, who have spent 14 days in quarantine, are being sent to their native villages in buses, said officials on Friday.


Out of the 521 migrant workers who were staying in the 15 shelter homes, 256 have already been sent to their native villages. The latest group comprising 95 workers were sent to various parts of Uttar Pradesh from Jewar on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. 

The buses, provided by the State Road Transport Corporation, are being used to ferry the workers to the district headquarters. The decision was taken following Uttar Pradesh government’s directive to identify migrants who are from the State and make arrangements to send them home after proper screening.

The buses have been roped in to transport the workers to Moradabad, Amroha, Bareilly, Sambhal, Aligarh, Budaon, Rampur, Deoria, Kushinagar and Gorakhpur in the early hours, said officials.

The local sub-divisional magistrate gives a letter to the bus driver and conductor and passes to the workers. The letter stays valid for 24 hours.

The staff at the shelter homes are told to ensure that the migrant worker has spent at least 14 days there and have no symptoms.

Tehsildar of Jewar sub-division, Durgesh Singh, said each worker is provided with 10kg rice, 10kg flour, 2kg pulses, 2kg chickpea, 1 litre oil, turmeric powder, salt and other basic spices in a bag. “The idea is to ensure they do not venture out till May 3,” added Singh.

A list containing the names of migrants, who are sent home, is shared with senior officials in Lucknow for further coordination. The authorities also roped in local policemen to escort the worker safely to their homes.
