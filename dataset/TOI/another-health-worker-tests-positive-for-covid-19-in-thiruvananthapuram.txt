THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : An ASHA worker tested positive for Covid-19 infection in Thiruvanahtapuram on Sunday. She is the third staffer from the health department to have contracted the virus. 


The 51-year-old woman, who is attached with a primary health centre Amachal and is a resident of Ettiruthy has been an active field worker in surveillance of homes where people have been kept under isolation in the district. 

She said that she had no clue about the source of infection. She was active with field work and her swab was collected on June 11. She is also the first health worker to be tested positive as part of sentinel surveillance being done for health care workers in the district.

An ambulance driver employed at Navaikulam primary health centre was tested positive for the infection on May 25. 

A nursing assistant at Medical college was tested positive on June 9. The epidemiolgical investigation team has been unable to detect source of infection in previous two cases. 

It is being cited that the ambulance driver may have contracted infection while transporting expatriates. However, this also raises another concern regarding breach of prevention protocol. 

In the case of nursing assistant, a series of violations were reported in testing and admission protocol as she was sent back home after collecting her swab at a medical college. Her father and her husband are now being treated for Covid 19. 

The ambulance driver had reported mild symptoms while the nursing assistant had shown clear symptoms before she was tested and confirmed with Covid 19. 

The ASHA worker said that she had taken special precaution even during her field work. 

``I took care of my grand kids at home hence I was always cautious. I have no idea as to how I got infected,'' she said.
