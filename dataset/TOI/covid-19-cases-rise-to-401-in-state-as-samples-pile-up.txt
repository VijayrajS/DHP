DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand reported 44 new cases on Tuesday, 13 of them passengers of the Mumbai-Haridwar Shramik Special Express. With this, the tally of Covid-19 cases reached 401 in the state.

According to the health department, three people were found positive in Dehradun, while Nainital (the district with the most coronavirus cases so far) reported 10 cases on May 26. Haridwar reported six new cases, among them a government hospital nurse and a 9-year-old child. Apart from these, six new cases were reported from Tehri, two from Udham Singh Nagar, three from Almora and as many as 14 from Pithoragarh. On Tuesday, the coronavirus recovery rate dropped to 16 per cent, with 329 active cases in the state.

Meanwhile, the state is grappling with the problem of Covid-19 test samples piling up. Samples collected as far back as May 16 haven’t been tested yet. 

Even as three out of four Covid-19 laboratories in Uttarakhand are conducting pool tests, reports of 3,500 samples are awaited in the state as of Tuesday. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh, Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) and Susheela Tiwari Medical College in Haldwani are conducting pool testing .

Harish Thapliyal, the PRO of AIIMS Rishikesh said , “We have around 1,200 samples pending from May 20 to 24 and are deep freezing the rest of the samples given \after that. Scarcity of kits was one of the prime reasons behind slow testing.” 

Dr Pankaj Pandey of the health and family welfare department said that the reason for delay in arrival of reports was because more sampling is being done.

“We are doing our best to deliver test results faster. We also plan to allow some private labs in the city, which have proper facilities, to conduct Covid-19 tests,” Pandey added.
