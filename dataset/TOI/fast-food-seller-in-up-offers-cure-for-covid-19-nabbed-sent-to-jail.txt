Yadav claimed the medicine was made 27 years ago and can destroy any form of virus, let alone novel coronavirus. He runs a small shop of fast food near a college. The video is simply aimed at drawing attention. We have arrested him,” the SP said.Yadav also said that his entire family was consuming the medicine for the last six years and the disease cannot even “touch anyone of them”.
