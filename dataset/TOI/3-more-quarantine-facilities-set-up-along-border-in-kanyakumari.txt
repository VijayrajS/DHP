Kanyakumari: The Kanyakumari district administration has stepped up screening of vehicles entering Tamil Nadu from Kerala and has also established three new quarantine facilities close to the border as part of Covid-19 precautionary measures.

Speaking to TOI on Friday, Kanyakumari collector Prashant M Wadnere said the administration may consider the option of closing the border similar to Coimbatore, in case of emergency.

Apart from intensifying screening to 100%, they have also identified three colleges close to the border as temporary quarantine facilities for mass admission of suspects who enter the state. 

Meanwhile, commuters between the two states through Kanyakumari district have come down drastically. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation that used to operate 47 buses between Kanyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram has reduced it to around 25 buses per day. “Occupancy in TNSTC and KSRTC (Kerala) buses is only around 50%,” the collector said.

The district administration has also asked guests to avoid weddings that take place till March 31. “We have given this instruction as the possibility of the infection spreading on a large scale is high in a bigger crowd,” he said.

Religious institutions in the district were also asked to avoid prayers or gatherings till March 31. Churches in Kanyakumari district started circulating messages to their members that regular services on Sundays and in the weeks during the Lent season will not take place till the end of this month.
