VADODARA: A two-year-old girl from Bodeli, who was the second person to test positive for coronavirus in Chhota Udepur district, was discharged from GMERS Medical College and Hospital in Gotri on Tuesday.

Aayesha Khatri had contracted the virus from her 60-year-old grandfather who too was discharged from the same hospital last week. During treatment, Khatri was tested a couple of times and her reports were negative due to which she was discharged after 13 days. However, her mother, who was taking care of her, too tested positive and is still undergoing treatment at the hospital. The girl was sent back home with her father.

“We are happy that after my father, my daughter has won the fight against coronavirus. We are now waiting for my wife to get discharged,” said the girl’s father, Ahmedullah.

Doctors at the hospital said that Aayesha had very few symptoms of the dreaded virus and she was treated as per the protocols which yielded results. Until now, five patients, including the little girl, have been discharged by the hospital. Four other patients including her grandfather were above 50 years of age. Doctors said that all patients who have been discharged so far were of high risk due to their age and also two patients had diabetes and kidney-related ailments. 

Chhota Udepur district has now five active cases, four of which are from Bodeli and one from Chhota Udepur town. Except for the Aayesha’s mother, the other patients from Bodeli are undergoing treatment at isolation ward in Chhota Udepur while the patient from Chhota Udepur town is undergoing treatment at a private hospital on Waghodia Road in Vadodara.
