2020-04-18
KOLKATA: A private hospital at Mollar Gate under Maheshtala Municipality has sent 38 staffers, including doctors and nurses, to quarantine after a patient who was admitted in the hospital on April 10 tested positive to Covid-19. While the patient was sent to MR Bangur, the hospital has not shifted other patients and is waiting for the health department order.


“We sent him to M R Bangur on April 12. On April 15, we came to know that he was Covid-positive and decided to stop all activities. None was allowed to enter or leave the hospital,” a source said. The patient is stated to be stable.

The 350-bed facility is a joint venture of Maheshtala Municipality and a private group. “We cannot close it without making an alternative arrangement. The staffers who came in contact with the patient have been sent to quarantine. A sanitisation process is underway,” Maheshtala Municipality chairman Dulal Das said.
