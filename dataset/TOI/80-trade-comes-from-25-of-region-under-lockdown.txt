‘80% trade comes from 25% of region under lockdown’
2020-05-04
Ahmedabad: Instead of 40, it will now be a 54-day lockdown for Ahmedabad, as the state government has clearly spelled out that no new relaxation will be extended to the four major cities in addition to Gandhinagar and Bhavnagar in the coming two weeks. While it does leave people both scared and frustrated at the same time, it will certainly weigh down heavily on the retailers. Estimates by Gujarat Traders’ Federation (GTF) suggest that 80% of wholesale and retail trade comes from 25% of the state’s region which is under a lockdown.“Retailers were already reeling under a demand slowdown even before the Covid-19 pandemic was announced. No relaxation for retail trade in major urban centres will only add to the woes of traders, with small retailers getting worst affected,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, GTF. “The government must review its decision and allow gradual opening of trade in areas outside containment zones. We had sent a representation last week to the government, suggesting allowing opening of stores selling non-essential items for two days in a week on a rotational basis and then relax further by reviewing the situation,” Tanna further added.Industry players are also of the opinion that retail should be allowed to resume in accordance with the guidelines of the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).
