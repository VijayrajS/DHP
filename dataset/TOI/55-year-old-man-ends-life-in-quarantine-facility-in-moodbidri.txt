Mangaluru: A 55-year-old man who was kept under institutional quarantine at a school in Kadandale in Moodbidri was found dead on Thursday.

The deceased along with seven family members had returned to district from Maharashtra on May 20, said Mangaluru sub-division assistant commissioner Madan Mohan.

Authorities surmise that the person may have committed suicide due to personal issues. However, as a precautionary measure, his swabs have been collected and sent for testing. A call on carrying out his final rites will be decided once the reports come in, said police.

Two other family members who had returned with them from Maharashtra had alighted in Udupi and had reported to institutional quarantine facility there, said the assistant commissioner, adding that the family of the deceased chose Kadandale since it was closer to their home.

The official added that the deceased had lost his job in a hotel in Mumbai and was believed to be facing family issues. He is survived by three unmarried daughters. Financial uncertainty too may have forced him to take the extreme step, the official said. “However, we want to rule out any foul play in his death though reasons for the death may be apparent and so an unnatural death report has been registered,” he said.

The body has been shifted to mortuary at district Wenlock Hospital for an autopsy. 

The official who appraised district in charge minister Kota Shrinivas Poojary of the situation said the minister has spoken to CM B S Yediyurappa and sought financial compensation for the distraught family. 

The administration has also taken steps to shift the family members of the deceased to an alternate quarantine facility as per their request, said Madan Mohan.
