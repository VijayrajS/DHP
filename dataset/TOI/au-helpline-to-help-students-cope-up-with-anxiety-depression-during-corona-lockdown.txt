2020-04-09
Prayagraj: Allahabad University (AU) has launched a helpline for its students dealing with mental health issues like anxiety and depression during the lockdown enforced to curb novel coornavirus cases. 

The helpline was launched following directives from the University Grants Commission (UGC), which has directed universities across the country to come up with measures to help students deal with these testing times. 

UGC secretary (letter number F. No. 1-1/2020 (secy) dated April 5) wrote to varsities on the subject of the mental health and wellbeing of students during and after Covid-19 outbreak. 

“Following the directives of the UGC, we have formed a helpline for students reeling under mental health problems,” said AU registrar NK Shukla. 

The AU team running the helpline will comprise dean (students welfare) KP Singh, chief proctor RK Upadhyaya, Dr SK Agarwal of the university’s health centre and, other senior teachers from departments of phycology and Centre of behavioural and cognitive sciences (CBCS). 

“Through the helpline, we will regularly monitor students via phone calls, emails, digital and social media platforms. We will spread information about Covid-19, help groups of students headed by hostel wardens/ senior faculty members so as to provide immediate necessary help,” said Shukla.

The helpline would also facilitate sharing of the several video links on AU’s website aimed at helping the students handle the stress. 

“As these students are not able to head out or meet their friends, they are left to their own devices and might experience mental health problems like anxiety and depression. The helpline can help students in overcoming some of those problems,” said Bhoomika Kar of AU’s CBCS.
