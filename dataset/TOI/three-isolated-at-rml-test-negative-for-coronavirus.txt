NEW DELHI: All three patients quarantined at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital have tested negative for novel coronavirus (nCoV) and were discharged on Thursday. 

“Their samples were sent for testing to NIV Pune and have tested negative,” said an Union health ministry official. The three men had self-reported at the Centre-run hospital designated to deal with such cases on Monday with complaints of respiratory trouble and fever.

Priya Abraham, director, National Institute of Virology, Pune, said, “Till now, 49 samples have been tested of which one has tested positive.” She added that the positive sample belonged to a student from Kerala who was studying in Wuhan. 

With China struggling to contain the fast-spreading novel coronavirus, the Union health ministry had on Wednesday urged Indians to refrain from travelling to China. The advisory further urged all those travelling to China to monitor their health closely. A 24x7 helpline number (011-23978046) to redress any queries related to the respiratory infection has been set up. The ministry has also made four more laboratories functional, other than the NIV-Pune, for testing samples.

Several states, including Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan have kept some people with travel history to China under observation after they showed novel coronavirus-like symptoms. Meanwhile, scientists said they have been able to map the symptoms among 99 patients diagnosed with the infection in China. 

According to a new analysis published in The Lancet, most patients were treated with anti-virals (75 ), antibiotics (70), and oxygen therapy (75), and had a good prognosis. However, 17 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 11 of whom died of multiple organ failure.
