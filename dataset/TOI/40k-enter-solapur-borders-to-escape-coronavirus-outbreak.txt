KOLHAPUR: The Solapur district administration has launched a massive drive to educate the people on possible coronavirus threats in view of the large scale of people arriving from major cities. 


So far, the district has not reported any positive case except for few people, who have been directed to undergo home quarantine.

Many people, who had shifted to major cities in Maharashtra and Karnataka for employment, returned after the fear of coronavirus gripped the people across the nation. 

Just before the nationwide shutdown, a large number of vehicles carrying commuters entered Solapur district. Officials from district collectorate said that they have recorded around 40,000 names of people entering the district in the last few days. 

According to the officials, around 20,000 people came from Pune followed by 12,000 from Mumbai. Only after the country-wide shutdown three-days back that the arrival of people has been reduced as the district borders have been sealed by the district administration. 

Officials said that people are returning to their villages, which fall under the drought-prone areas. Those areas don’t even have basic facilities along with a lack of employment. 

In Sangol taluka, which has perennial drought conditions, around 5,000 people have arrived in the past few days. As many as 1500 people in Sangola have been advised home quarantine. 

In rural parts, the village level committees have been formed to monitor the movement of the guests and to ensure whether people are following government guidelines. The committees are using public address systems or traditional ‘dawandi’ to alert the people about government decisions. 

In Solapur city, the municipal corporation has put temporary 130 washbasins where people can wash the hands. The civic body has made online submission of the registration, which is mandatory for the guests. Around 100 people have registered so far.
