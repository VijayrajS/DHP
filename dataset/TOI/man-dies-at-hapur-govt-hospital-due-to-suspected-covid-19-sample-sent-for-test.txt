MEERUT: A 55-year-old man, quarantined at a government hospital in UP’s Hapur along with his wife and two daughters, died on Sunday, with doctors saying that he was suffering from respiratory ailment.


No test was conducted on the quarantined family to know if they were carrying the Covid-19 infection. It was only after the death of the man that the hospital authorities took the samples and sent it for testing. “We have sent his sample to Meerut lab to confirm whether he was Covid-19 positive or not. He was suffering from respiratory issues,” said Aditi Singh, Hapur’s district magistrate (DM). 

“Autopsy will be performed if his report is negative. His wife and two daughters are also kept in quarantine facility at same medical college,” DM Singh added.

The patient was a resident of Hapur’s Dholana village which has been branded as one of the hotspots for novel coronavirus infection. The disease spread there from a man who returned after attending Tablighi Jamaat at Delhi’s Nizamuddin.

Hapur has reported 41 novel coronavirus positive cases so far. 

More than 8,000 people are under quarantine while 576 are under isolation.
