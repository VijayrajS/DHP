NEW DELHI: Doctors need to take precautions to prevent getting infected by Covid-19 at not just designated health facilities, but also other centres. One such example is the doctor who contracted novel coronavirus from a 38-year-old woman who had visited him at a mohalla clinic in northeast Delhi about a fortnight ago.

The doctor, who was admitted to GTB Hospital initially, had to be shifted to Safdarjung Hospital on Monday night after he complained of breathing difficulty. “He was kept in the ICU. Once his condition stabilised, he was shifted to the isolation room,” Dr Harish Gupta, his colleague and president of Delhi Medical Association, told TOI. Gupta added that the doctor’s wife and his daughter have also tested positive for Covid-19 and their swab samples have been sent for re-confirmation. “They are in a stable condition,” he said.

Meanwhile, Delhi government is scanning the names of all patients that the doctor saw at the mohalla clinic after coming in contact with the 38-year-old women. Government data shows five of Delhi’s 30 novel coronavirus cases so far, excluding the woman, are linked to her.

District health officials said that 74 people living in her neighbourhood are under surveillance. “When the woman tested positive for Covid-19, we rushed to her residence to ask her family for names and addresses of people who had visited them since March 10, the day she returned from Dubai,” an official said.

The official added, “The family members weren’t very cooperative, so we had to seek the help of local police to get information. We also used the footage from CCTV cameras to identify people who needed to be put under surveillance.”

The woman’s brother and mother live in northeast Delhi’s Jahangirpuri. The people they came in contact with are also being screened, sources said.
