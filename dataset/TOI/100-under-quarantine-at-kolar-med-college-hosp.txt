100 under quarantine at Kolar med college hosp
2020-04-02
Bhopal: About 100 people are under quarantine in a private medical college in Kolar and many more are under home isolation and quarantine in other facilities across the state capital. The idea of quarantine is to prevent spread and break the chain of spread of COVID-19, said Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Sudhir Dheriya.

Dheriya in a recent video posted on social media, showed him going home from work after five days.

It is a similar story for almost all health workers and health department officials and employees across Madhya Pradesh, leading the fight against COVID-19. They urge people to stay home as they treat and care for those at risk or with COVID-19.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Lydia Bourouiba in a ground-breaking paper ‘Potential Implications for Reducing Transmission of COVID-19’ highlights best approaches for source control to potentially improve protection of front-line workers and prevent disease from spreading to the most vulnerable members of the population. He writes, “There is a need to understand the biophysics of host-to-host respiratory disease transmission accounting for in-host physiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiological spread of disease,” according to Dr Bourouiba.

WHO, CDC classification systems employ various arbitrary droplet diameter cut offs, from 5 to 10 μm, to categorize host-to-host transmission as droplets or aerosol routes. The rapid international spread ofCOVID-19 suggests that using arbitrary droplet size cut offs may not accurately reflect what actually occurs with respiratory emissions, possibly contributing to the ineffectiveness of some procedures used to limit the spread of respiratory disease, warns the study.

The need for quarantine:

Current understanding of host-to-host transmission in respiratory infectious diseases are predicated on a model of developed in the 1930s

2020 China report suggests coronavirus 2 virus particles could be found in the ventilation systems in hosp rooms of COVID patients

Given various combinations of an individual patient’s physiology and environmental conditions droplets of all sizes can travel 23 to 27 feet (7-8 m)

Latest WHO recommendations for COVID-19, advises healthcare workers to maintain a 3-feet (1-m)6 distance away from a patient or suspect

Currently used surgical and N95 masks are not tested for these potential characteristics of respiratory emissions
