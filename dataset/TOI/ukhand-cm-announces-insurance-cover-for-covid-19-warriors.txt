Uttarakhand CM announces insurance cover for ‘Covid-19 Warriors’
2020-03-26
DEHRADUN: Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Wednesday declared that an insurance cover would be provided to all the ‘Covid-19 warriors’, including health officers, mediapersons, police personnel, doctors and medical staff, who were carrying out their duty during the ongoing crisis even at the risk of their own health. The modalities of the insurance cover that would be extended was still being worked out, a source in the CM’s office said.


The CM made the announcement during the assembly session convened on Wednesday in which the state’s Rs 53,526-crore budget for financial year 2020-21 was passed. The budget had been tabled in the assembly session held at Gairsain earlier this month. In wake of the coronavirus scare, the day’s proceedings were restricted to less than an hour, following which Speaker Prem Chand Agarwal adjourned the House sine die. 

Addressing the House, CM Rawat said, “Around 2,082 people from China and other Covid-19-affected countries have come to Uttarakhand. Of this, 628 people have completed a quarantine period of 28 days and 1,323 are undergoing quarantine. Remaining 131 people have left the state.” 

He assured the House that adequate arrangements have been made for quarantine and isolation of patients and suspects, and the task force that has been constituted for the purpose, is monitoring the situation closely. 

Leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh said that the Congress party supports the state government in its effort against Covid-19 “but the only concern is that district and health officers do not receive calls.” “If they cannot receive calls, they should depute someone for the purpose so that if there is any case or an emergency, prompt action can be taken.”
