HC declines to interfere in plea for pre-flight Covid test
2020-05-21
Kochi: Kerala high court has declined to interfere in the demand for conducting test to detect Covid-19 on returning expatriates before they board the flight from a foreign country.

A division bench comprising justices Anu Sivaraman and M R Anitha said on Wednesday that interference is not warranted now and that the central government will revise its standard operating protocol (SOP) in a timely manner, noting the requests made by state governments.

The court considered a petition (WP-C No. 9804/2020) filed by C R Neelakandan seeking administration of RT-PCR test prior to boarding. The petitioner pointed out that Kerala chief minister has written to the central government on the need for testing the expatriates prior to boarding the flight.

Noting that the SOP was framed by the central government in due consultation with medical experts, the court said concerns expressed by individual state governments are to be addressed by the central government. The court further said it has no doubt that a proper procedure will be put in place and revised in a time-bound manner by the central government after considering the situation prevalent, suggestions by state governments, expert medical advice, and relevant data. 

“We are of the opinion that an interference through a writ of mandamus is not warranted at this stage. Suffice it to say that concerns expressed by the state government will also be considered by the central government while formulating and revising standard operating protocols in respect of the required testing as well. In the absence of any further material, it may not be proper for this court to issue the directions as sought for by the petitioner,” the judgment stated. While closing the petition, the court observed that the concerns raised by the state government will also be duly considered by the central government.

The chief minister’s letter had stated that the consequence of not conducting the Covid-19 test prior to boarding will result in people who are carriers of infection traveling along with others, leading to spread of infection when they reach their homes, the counsel said, adding that several passengers are suspected to have consumed analgesics and tablets to reduce body temperature, thus escaping detection.

Central government counsel (CGC) Suvin R Menon had submitted that pre-embarkation checks are conducted by the officials of the foreign airport in tune with the norms in vogue at the particular airport. The CGC had also submitted that the Supreme Court stayed Orissa high court’s interim order that allowed only those migrant workers who tested negative for Covid-19 to re-enter the state and has observed that the guidelines brought in by the central government afford sufficient protection.
