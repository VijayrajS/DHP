Testing times ahead with stores fast running out of provisions in Pune
2020-03-28
PUNE: Shelves and aisles across multiple grocery stores and super markets in the city have run dry amid lack of fresh supply in the wake of the 21-day nationwide lockdown triggered by the Covid-19 spread.


Wanowrie resident Sakshi Jain said, “I had stepped out to buy some groceries on Friday. The fruit section of the grocery shop I visited was shut. Vegetables were available but were of poor quality. Coffee powder wasn’t available either. I tried to visit other stores as well but the entire market, including grocery stores, is shut at Jagtap Chowk.”

Similar was the case on Satara Road. “Several food products are not available in the Satara Road area. Even to get milk, one needs to step out either very early in the morning or late in the evening,” Purva Sankhla, a resident of Satara Road, rued. 

NIBM Road, Kondhwa and their surrounding areas are among the worst affected, with shelves at most shops almost bare. Residents from the area said there was a shortage of milk powder, butter, cooking oil, biscuits, pulses and grains. 

According to the owner of Chandradeep Stores, Ramesh Rathod, noodles, tetrapak milk, packaged frozen chicken, dry snacks, flour, honey, disinfectants and other cleaning agents have almost disappeared from shop shelves in several parts of the city. “Many brands selling these products have warehouses in Pune, but the stock is not reaching shops due to logistical issues and staff crunch,” he said.

Distributor of FMCG products Sham Mundada said, “Stocks of several items across the city have started depleting. We are still trying to figure a way to resume operations.”
