HYDERABAD: In a crucial review meeting on Monday, chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao will announce new steps to check the spread of coronavirus in Greater Hyderabad, even as an employee at the chief ministerâ€™s office (CMO) tested positive for the virus.

The employee working in CMO in Metro Rail Bhavan at Rasoolpura tested positive after his son returned from Mumbai a few days ago. Following this, senior officers have stopped coming to CMO in Metro Rail Bhavan and are working from home or other offices in the city. The entire building is being sanitized.

The meeting by the CM will be held at Pragathi Bhavan from 4.30 pm onwards and will discuss measures taken for the containment of the coronavirus, implementation of the lockdown and other related issues.

The number of coronavirus positive cases and deaths have been only increasing in the city and the sources say that the meeting would in all likelihood discuss the possibility of extending lockdown in Greater Hyderabad. A number of health care staffers, including doctors, testing positive has only worsened to the situation. 

The meeting will discuss all issues pertaining to covid-19 and decisions will be taken accordingly, an official said. Health Minister Eatala Rajender and senior officials will participate in the meeting.

Sources say the meeting would entail officials discussing the possibility of extending lockdown in Greater Hyderabad due to surge in Covid-19 cases
