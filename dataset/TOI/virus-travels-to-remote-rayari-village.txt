2020-05-28
PUNE: A family of four, including two girls aged 6 and 2 years, from Rayari village in Bhor taluka, has been quarantined in a hospital in Pune city after their swab samples on Tuesday showed they had developed Covid-19. 


The father had visited Market Yard a few days ago and was the first to develop nCoV symptoms. 

Rayari is in the hilly terrain near the backwaters of Nira-Devghar dam, about 90km from Pune. One has to cross the Nira river twice and a couple of ghats to reach the village. 

A Bhor police officer said after returning from Pune and falling ill, the man approached the local primary health centre and was sent to the government hospital. Swab samples of the family were collected and they were told to shift to a quarantine facility the same day, the officer added. It is not known how the man contracted the virus. 

Eight persons have tested positive in Bhor. Neighbouring Velhe has 18 infected persons.
