Associations ask hospitals to take in Covid cases
2020-05-21
Ahmedabad: After several meetings with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) over issues ranging from per patient costs to the facilities provided to hospitals, Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) and Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) appealed to its members to start admission of Covid-19 positive patients ‘without waiting for formalities like signing of MoUs’.

In an appeal by Dr Mona Desai, president of AMA, on Wednesday, doctors were asked to admit patients referred by the government and AMC as part of their wider social responsibility.

Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said that the members have decided to start admitting patients considering the continued rise in the mortality rate.

“Many patients have been transferred to these private hospitals from Civil Hospital Medicity and SVP Hospitals. All patients whose treatment costs will be paid by AMC as per the government circular, will be sent to the private hospitals by the nodal medical officer of AMC,” said Dr Gadhvi. “There will be no direct admission of patients whose treatment costs are being borne by AMC/state government.”

AHNA also raised the issue of high costs and quality of triple-layer and N95 masks available in the city. In a letter to FDCA commissioner Dr H G Koshia, the association said that suppliers have jacked up prices by 300% to 400%. “AHNA also asked that N95 masks and three-ply surgical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers treating Covid patients. They should not be sold to the public,” the letter said.
