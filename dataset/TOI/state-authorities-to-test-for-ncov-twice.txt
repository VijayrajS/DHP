2020-01-30
HYDERABAD: The Centre on Wednesday instructed state health authorities to run tests for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) twice, with the second within 48 hours of the first test, even in case of a sample turning out to be negative in the first case. The new guidelines were conveyed at a video conference held. 


Two samples, which had been tested negative earlier, will have to be tested again. “The test result may not be 100% accurate which his why a second confirmatory test is to be run as per the order,” said a highly-placed source.

Meanwhile, state health authorities are making preparations to test for the virus at the ICMR laboratory in Gandhi Medical College within 10 days, hoping that testing kits will be sent by the Centre at the earliest. Currently, samples are being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, by courier and it takes at least 24 hours to get the results. 

So far, 10 people from across the state is admitted to the Fever Hospital for suspected infection. Of them, five have no symptoms (two tested negative) and samples from five others are being testing at NIV. The five patients, who were kept at the isolation ward of the Fever Hospital, had come to the country from Hong Kong last week.
