Trichy: Pudukottai Government Medical College Hospital started testing Covid-19 samples after health minister C Vijaya Baskar inaugurated the facility on Sunday.Real-time polymerase chain reaction laboratory, popularly known as RT-PCR lab, which can test 300 samples a day, was set up at a cost of Rs 52 lakh. So far, samples from Pudukottai were sent to Trichy or Tiruvarur for testing resulting in delays. The facility was ready for operations a few days ago, but it was awaiting approval from Indian council for Medical Research (ICMR) New Delhi. The government Pudukkottai Medical College received RT PCR machine on April 8. “The college has created necessary infrastructure, trained medical and paramedical staff, procured ancillary equipment and reagent kits and a test run was also completed,” said medical college dean, A L Meenakshi Sundaram.So far, 973 samples have been sent for testing from Pudukottai. While 942 samples tested negative, one has been tested positive. We are awaiting results of 30 samples and these samples will be tested in Pudukottai, he said.The lab will be run round-the-clock with five microbiologists and six lab technicians. The number of samples is expected to be less in Pudukottai as we have less number of contacts tracing as there was only one positive case. So far, samples were collected from people with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Now samples of pregnant woman in the district are also being taken. This is to ensure safety of doctors, said the dean.
