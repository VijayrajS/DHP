GMR Kamalanga project sale to JSW hits Covid roadblock
2020-05-22
Hyderabad; Just over three months after GMR group announced that it would be selling its 1050MW (3x350 MW) Kamalanga power project in Odisha to Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group for Rs 5321 crore, the deal has hit a Covid-19 roadblock.

GMR group was to divest its entire stake in the Odisha-based power project that supplies electricity to states like Odisha, Bihar and Haryana under long-term power purchase agreements.

GMR Infrastructure Ltd said in a regulatory filing to the bourses on Thursday that the divestment of GMR Energy Limited’s entire stake in GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd to JSW Energy Ltd has been “put on hold due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown”.

GMR said the deal would be “revisited once the situation normalizes”. “Even in these hard times, with demand falling across India, the pithead plant of GMR Kamalanga Energy Limited is fully operational,” GMR Infra said in the regulatory filing.

“The government announcing series of reforms along with Rs 90,000 crore package to discoms for easing liquidity is a step in the right direction for power sector,” it added in the filing.

The Kamalanga project was one the 36 identified stressed power assets undergoing debt resolution. Had it gone through, the deal would have helped GMR Infrastructure prune its debt. TNN
