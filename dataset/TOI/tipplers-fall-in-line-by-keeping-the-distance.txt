2020-03-20
KOCHI: Tipplers queuing up at Bevco outlets are being asked to keep a distance of 1m from each other as a precaution against Covid-19. Marking lines were drawn before the outlets of Beverages (M&M) Corporation Ltd, to demarcate the position of customers but many seemed unaware of the new restrictions.

“There is not much rush these days. We have also taken the help of a security guard to ensure guidelines are followed,” said a counter clerk at an outlet in Kaloor. Queue positions were marked using yellow paint on the cemented floor before the store, but three customers were seen standing close one behind the other.

Bevco outlets have asked customers to wear masks, wash hands and use handkerchiefs while coughing and sneezing. It has also advised people to choose hours when the rush is less for buying liquor and avoid crowding before shops after purchase.

“We are asking customers to wash their hands before entering the store. Staffers are using masks and gloves as precaution,” said an employee at Consumerfed outlet in Kadavanthra.

Bevco sells liquor worth around Rs 40 crore every day and is one of the key revenue sources of the cash-strapped government.
