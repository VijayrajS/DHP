2020-03-18
Kolhapur: Sangli district administration has formed a taluka-level special committee to monitor movement and treatment of people who have been advised home quarantine.

Sangli district collector Abhijit Chowdhary, in a press statement, said that tehsildar will be the ex-officio president of the committee while a police inspector, block development officer and chief officer of the concerned local self-body would be the members.

The committee has been asked to visit houses of those people who have been asked to remain under home quarantine and ensure that they are following the guidelines issued by the government.

The committee will also warn the people of using force if they come to know about people not following the guidelines. “If the individual concerned is found not following advisory even after issuing of warning, police would forcefully take him to a government hospital,” sources said.

The committee will carry out the activity on a day-to-day basis and submit a report to the district collector. The committee will also get regular update from local tour operators about people who are travelling and have returned to their homes, and will decide the future course of action. People travelling or returning from the foreign countries will be under scanner of the committee.

“The committee has been empowered to take on the spot decision considering the situation prevailing at that time,” Chowdhary said.

Meanwhile, district collectors of Sangli and Satara have appealed to the citizens to refrain from coming to government offices and use the online services for any work.

Local authorities have been asked to ensure that only vegetables and fruits are sold in weekly markets. They have also been asked to ensure safe distance between two vendors during the weekly-markets.
