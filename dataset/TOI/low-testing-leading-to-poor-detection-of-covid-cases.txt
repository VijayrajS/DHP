Kolhapur: Only one Covid-19 case was reported in Kolhapur district for the second consecutive day on Thursday. The patient is from Hatkanangale taluka, who recently travelled from Mumbai. 

The number of active cases have come down to 94 after 22 patients were discharged from hospitals on Thursday. Of the 696 positive cases registered in kolhapur district, 594 people have been discharged. The number of Covid-19 cases surged after May 3 as a large number of people travelled to Kolhapur district and those who came from red zones were put in quarantine till the testing was done.

The fact that only few cases are being reported in the last two days has been attributed to the low number of throat swab samples tested on Wednesday. “Currently, we are focussing on the symptomatic patients who are put in the isolation facilities. We will soon start testing the asymptomatic cases. The testings will be ramped now as most of the patients have been discharged and there is minimal strain on the health staff,” said a senior health official.

The official further said that the discharged patients have been asked to be in home-isolation for a week. The discharged patients have been given multivitamin tablets and been asked to strictly follow the diet suggested by the doctors.
