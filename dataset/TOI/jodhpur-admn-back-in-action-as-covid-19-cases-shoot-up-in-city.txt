Jodhpur administration back in action as Covid-19 cases shoot up in city
2020-05-31
JODHPUR: With 40 Covid-19 positive cases reported from Pratap Nagar area on Friday, city police got back in action and spruced up lockdown measures in the locality by re-establishing barricades and blocking the roads and streets on Saturday.

The city recorded a sharp spike in cases this week. In the past six days, there have been 287 positive cases, most of which were reported from just one locality, Pratap Nagar. The area has reported over 200 cases and counting, which is attributable to the leniency of the administration.

DCP (West) Priti Chandra, who reached Pratap Nagar with her officers, warned the residents of the locality of serious action against those, who did not abide by the lockdown protocol.

“We will not tolerate this now. We will take strict action, if needed. We do not want to be so harsh, but people must understand the seriousness of the issue,” she said.

This leniency has also led to reporting of positive cases from Bakra Mandi, which reported 13 cases on Friday. People of this locality were hardly complying with the lockdown protocol and assembled in groups occasionally.

With relaxation in lockdown, people started coming out of their houses in droves and queuing up at the commercial outlets and the negligence exercised by both sides has led to surfacing of positive cases.

On Friday, two employees of a departmental store were reported positive besides two employees of Saras Dairy, who were engaged in milk distribution.

On Saturday, staff of some famous eateries and dairy shops in Sardarpura area also reported positive.

Even with the spike in cases, people have been constantly protesting against police for putting up barricades in sensitive areas. Recently some areas had also seen protests by people for keeping their areas under curfew zone for a long period forcing police to retreat.
