Andhra Pradesh stares at Rs 6,000 crore/month revenue loss due to lockdown
2020-04-18
HYDERABAD: The novel coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have impacted Andhra Pradesh adversely with the state losing revenues to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore per month in the form of direct taxes. Notwithstanding the direct tax revenue loss, the indirect tax revenue loss is much bigger and yet to be quantified, say government sources. 

AP finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said the loss suffered during the lockdown would be hard to recoup. He told TOI, “Like any other state, AP’s state GST collection is almost zero. VAT on excise and petrol sales is negligible. Indirect tax revenue losses will be much bigger. Industries and private institutions are the worst hit as productivity has come to a grinding halt.”



Expressing concern over the magnitude of revenue loss, senior government officials said AP gets revenue of Rs 165 crore per day, which has now dipped to Rs 3 crore a day. “The government itself is selling liquor through its outlets. Thanks to the lockdown, the outlets are all shut and excise revenue has taken a hit. Petrol bunks are not fully functional. With restrictions on traffic movement, fuel sales have plummeted,” said a senior official.

Officials said apart from the revenue loss, the government has additional expenses to meet. “The government allocates Rs 1,300 crore on Rs 1,000 cash scheme for each poor person. Plus, we incur an additional Rs 1,400 crore bill to provide essential items to white ration card holders in the state,” an official said. As per the records, AP has 1.47 crore white ration card holders. “This is a big financial burden,” he said.

Meanwhile, former financial advisor to former CM Chandrababu Naidu, Kutumba Rao, wondered why AP is not raising money through bonds. “Telangana recently raised Rs 2,000 crore by auctioning bonds at RBI. Why can’t AP government do it to overcome the fund crisis?” he sought to know.
