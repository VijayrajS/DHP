PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has spent Rs 2 crore on various measures to check coronavirus spread in a fortnight.


Besides awareness drives and door-to-door survey, the funds were spent on procuring sanitizers, masks and medical equipment, among others, civic officials said. “The PMC’s efforts to mitigate the spread intensified after the first positive case was reported from the city on March 8. Thereafter, the infrastructure and other works to fight the contagion were completed on a war footing,” a senior civic official said.

Anjali Sabane, assistant medical officer of health at PMC, said the funds would also be used for the development of health infrastructure, such as setting up intensive care unit at Naidu hospital. The procured material was being used for civic officials as well as common public.

The health department had put forth four proposals worth Rs 1.27 crore, which were promptly approved by the standing committee as well as the general body of the PMC in a fortnight. Besides, solid waste management and anti-encroachment departments, among others, have also used funds for anti-coronavirus measures.

“The standing committee has decided to take up and approve these proposals on priority,” Hemant Rasane, standing committee chairman, said. 

Mayor Murulidhar Mohol said the general body was displaying cohesiveness while considering these proposals for approval. “The situation caused due to coronavirus in the city is unprecedented. The corporators from all political parties have supported all the measures to deal with the problem. The projects and proposals were approved without any voice of dissent,” he said.

“Senior civic officials, including additional commissioner and commissioner, have special powers to carry out procurement in larger public interest,” a senior official of municipal secretary department of PMC said.
