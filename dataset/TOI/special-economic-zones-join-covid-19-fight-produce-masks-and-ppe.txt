HYDERABAD: Brandix India at Atchutapuram special economic zone (SEZ) in Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh has joined the fight against Covid-19. Around 2.4 crore surgical masks and three core surgical gowns will be made at the facility. Similarly, three crore three-layer non-woven surgical masks will be made at Shinetech Apparel at VSEZ Duvvada to meet the demands of AP government. 


Despite lockdown, Visakhapatnam SEZ has ensured 370 units were operational in AP and Telangana, and all essential industries (Pharma) and IT units were kept functional with minimal staff. VSEZ, which has jurisdiction over AP and Telangana, has achieved exports to the tune of 96,886 crore in the 2019-20 fiscal, while it was 72,963 crore last year. 

VSEZ development commissioner A Rama Mohan Reddy said that SEZ units, especially IT/IT enabled services, and pharma, helped achieve the milestone. VSEZ with 489 operational units, spread over 58 SEZs in three states, has achieved 32.79% growth in exports compared to last year. It was also highest among the seven zones of the country, despite global economic recession. 

"During the 2019-20 fiscal, 3.79 lakhs jobs were geneated compared to 3.39 lakh in the 2018-19 fiscal, which was also a growth of nearly 12 %. Despite all odds, during the last fiscal year, we had issued approvals to 95 new units with an investment of 8,631 crore and estimated export potential to the tune of 59,111 cr and projected employment generation of 69,077 jobs , in the next five years," he added. 

During the ongoing lockdown period, 46 pharma units, two food-based units (coffee) and 322 IT/ITeS units are operational on minimum personnel basis in shifts and work from home for IT units. "Though coronavirus will have an impact on production sector exports, it will have little impact on the services sector," he added.
