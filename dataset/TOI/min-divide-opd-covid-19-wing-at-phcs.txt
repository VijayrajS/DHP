HYDERABAD: Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender on Thursday said the outpatient department (OPD) at primary health centres (PHCs) should be separated from the wing which caters to those who exhibit Covid-19 symptoms.

Addressing Asha workers and ANMs in a video conference, he said all those migrants who are coming to the villages should be identified and checked before keeping them in home quarantine. He said transportation would be provided to health workers at the ground level if they have problems in reaching the PHCs. Advising the staff to focus on seasonal diseases that can spread in the coming months, he said a house-to-house survey would be done to check for symptoms of fever among villagers.
