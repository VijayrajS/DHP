2020-04-26
RUDRAPUR: Confusion prevailed in Gadarpur town of Udham Singh Nagar district after Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Friday night permitted the opening of some essential shops from Saturday. Traders and shoppers, assuming all lockdown guidelines had been lifted, rushed to the market. Police and administrative officials, caught by surprise, reached the market and requested all shopkeepers to close their shops and wait for a state government directive on the matter. 

The head of Gadarpur Traders’ Union Pankaj Sethia said, “I discussed the MHA order (on shops being allowed to open) with the sub-divisional magistrate, who told me that only a few shops will be allowed to open. But as the message did rounds on the social media and news outlets, traders, being unaware of the terms and conditions, opened their shops first thing on Saturday morning.” 

“The message was misinterpret by shopkeepers,” said Jaswinder Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Gadarpur police station. 

“As soon as the shops were opened, scores of people rushed to the market to buy commodities. We received information and I reached the market with police personnel to have people maintain social distancing and avoid chaos. We talked to the traders and after 3 hours, the market was once again shut down,” Singh added.

“We were not expecting any such situation as markets are usually closed in Gadarpur on Saturday,” said tehsildar Bhuwan Chandra Arya. “We told the traders that they have to adhere to the lockdown guidelines and pull down the shutters till the state government issues an advisory, which will be forwarded to them by the district administration,” Arya said.
