NOIDA: Health department officials have said that a group of foreigners that arrived in the city on March 6 pose no threat to local residents. A total of 42 foreigners were visiting the city for a tour organised at the behest of the ministry of textiles. 


The group visited textile production centres and units in Agra before travelling towards Jaipur. On March 6, they had reached the city from Jaipur and since then they have been staying at a hotel in Sector 31.

 According to the itinerary, the group would leave the city on March 28. 

 "They arrived in the country on February 1. None of them showed any symptoms associated with coronavirus. Individuals doubtful of carrying the virus need to spend 15 days in isolation. Their observation period was over long back," chief medical officer Anurag Bhargava said. 

However, after learning about cases being detected in Jaipur and the presence of Italian tourists, six from the group insisted on getting tested.

Their samples were collected at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida on Sunday but nothing was found and they were dropped back to the hotel later.

Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, said: "Nothing unusual was detected. There is no need to panic. We have sufficient detection kits and isolation wards at the health facilities in Noida." Most members of the team are from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Afghanistan.

Till Monday evening, no coronavirus cases had been reported from Gautam Budh Nagar district. 

 Bhargava said that he has been coordinating with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Delhi on a regular basis. "Nothing alarming has been brought to my notice and there is no need to be worried," Bhargava said.
