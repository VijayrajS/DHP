No lockdown for packaging material for essential goods
2020-04-04
Mumbai: The state government issued a clarification on Friday to ensure availability of packaging material for essential goods and for smooth functioning of production units which cannot be closed, such as steel and rubber.

An earlier government order had exempted these industries from the lockdown, stated the government’s earlier order. But they were still facing difficulties due to confusion and strict conditions imposed by the local administration. Officials said although industries involved in providing essential services were allowed to operate, their support and allied industries were unable to do so.

A senior office said, “For instance, industries involved in the production of medicine and food material will not be able to deliver in the coming days if they do not find packaging material. Similarly, there are some industries that cannot be shut because once they are, they will take a few months to become operational again, like steel and rubber industries. The government is allowing them to operate.”

On Friday, Ajoy Mehta, chief secretary of Maharashtra, issued a clarification to the previous lockdown circular on March 25. It stated: “All the necessary packaging units required for industrial units of 8(A) are allowed to operate.” It stated local authorities must ensure uninterrupted supply chain. (With Bhavika Jain)
