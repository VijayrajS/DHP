HUBBALLI: A youth from Bellatti village in Shirahatti taluk of Gadag district has offered himself for medical trials to find a cure for Covid-19 infection.

In a video, Veeresh Kuravatti, 22, has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept his offer and allow the researchers to conduct trials on him.

Veeresh, who is studying diploma (civil engineering) in Narasapur in the district, told STOI that Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in the country, and also claiming lives. “Many researchers are struggling to find a vaccine to treat Covid patients,” he said, adding that he got inspired from a person from Uttar Pradesh, who too has made a similar offer to the PM.

“I have decided to undergo experiments in the interest of the country, and help the government find medicines to control the virus. I have also sent a letter to the PM to accept my request. I’m waiting for a reply from the PMO. If I don’t get it, I shall tweet a reminder,” he said, and clarified that he is not doing this for publicity. “I seriously want to help researchers,” he added. 

Veeresh said he will also meet the Gadag DC and discuss the matter at the government level. 

However, Veeresh said his mother Suma Kuravatti, an anganwadi worker, is opposing his decision. “But I’m firm on this,” he added.
