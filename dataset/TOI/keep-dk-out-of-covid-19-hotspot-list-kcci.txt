Keep DK out of Covid-19 hotspot list: KCCI
2020-04-12
Mangaluru: Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry has urged additional chief secretary to state government in-charge of health and family welfare services, Jawaid Akhtar, to exclude Dakshina Kannada from the Covid-19 hotspot or red zone list. In a letter to Akhtar, Isaac Vas, KCCI president, said with no fresh Covid-19 cases reported in the district in the last six days, and five of the 12 positive cases getting cured and discharged, Dakshina Kannada should not be on the list.

Giving credit for effectively controlling the spread of Covid-19 to the district administration, and the people of the district for their cooperation, Isaac said stakeholders have maintained social distancing and used masks and hand sanitisers to good effect. The lockdown has effectively controlled the spread of Covid-19, but people of the district are facing hardship due to not having work to earn money, and consequently food has become scarce.

Dakshina Kannada reported a total 12 Covid-19 cases, including four from Kasaragod, one from Bhatkal, two from Bantwal and one each from Mangaluru (Thokkottu), Belthangady, Sullia and Puttur. Cases from Kasaragod and Bhatkal were from people with a travel history abroad. Of the 12 cases reported, five have recovered completely, and have been discharged. Others are showing signs of recovery. None of the Covid-19 patients in the district was admitted to the ICU or put on a ventilator, he said.
