Tax dept expects collections to drop due to virus impact

Panaji: A spiralling economy triggered due to the Covid-19 scare, especially the slump in Goa’s tourism sector, will lead to lower income tax and corporate tax collections in Goa, chief I-T commissioner B V Gopinath said here on Friday.

Gopinath, who held an awareness programme on the Centre’s ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’ scheme, said the closure of mining operations had already led to a dip in I-T collections and if the tourism sector also suffered because of coronavirus, income in the hands of taxpayers would come down.

“It looks like there is an issue of foreign tourist arrivals because of coronavirus. I suppose it will have an impact on income and subsequently, tax collection,” Gopinath said.

The I-T officer said that year-on-year tax collection from Goa has shown marginal growth. “The mining closure has affected tax collections. They have dipped in comparison to the period when mining was on in the state,” Gopinath said.

Among the private sector, pharma companies are the highest taxpayers in Goa, followed by the hospitality industry.

The ‘Vivad Se Vishwas’ scheme for direct taxpayers was launched by the I-T department to end litigation and allows taxpayers to pay only their dues and get a waiver on interest. However, a number of grey areas remain.

Five Goa government agencies feature among the several tax disputes pending in the state. Gopinath said the I-T department has raised a demand for nearly Rs 2 crore in total from the five public sector undertakings.

“We met the chief secretary to tell him that the state government PSUs can avail of the scheme, too,” Gopinath said.
