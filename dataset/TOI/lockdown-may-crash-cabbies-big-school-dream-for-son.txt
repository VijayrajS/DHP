Lockdown may crash cabbie’s ‘big school’ dream for son
2020-05-13
Nagpur: Each time the lockdown gets extended, cab driver Rahul Sharma sees his dream of providing “big school education” to his son crashing. Without any income since mid-March, Sharma is terrified at even the thought of his son being kicked out of a big brand CBSE school where the annual fee is almost Rs50,000.

“I worked day and night, went on lot of outstation trips to make extra money. All of this I did to ensure that unlike me, my six year-old son should get every opportunity possible to study in a big school,” said Sharma who purchased his cab in 2015.

His son Satvik could not secure a seat under free RTE quota but that did not deter Sharma. “I want him to study in the best possible environment and do something big in his life. I hope he becomes a big shot engineer, makes the best of the opportunity we are trying to provide him,” said the 34 year-old Sharma.

But the lockdown has turned Sharma’s life upside down, as he is sole earning member of the family. Hours upon hours of daily driving was helping the family of five adults and two children survive. “My sister has also moved back and she, my wife and father don’t have any source of income. Mother used to do odd stitching jobs from home but that also stopped since March,” said Sharma.

He fears the extended lockdown more than the virus itself. “Savings are almost finished and if this keeps on extending, I cannot survive this financial crisis as it is beyond me. Groceries, utility bills, car insurance etc will pile up to hefty amount very soon. We have heard cab aggregators will give preference to company-owned vehicles thus leaving most of us in the lurch,” said Sharma.

Even if he manages to pay up those bills, a big question mark still remains on how he will arrange for the school fee.
