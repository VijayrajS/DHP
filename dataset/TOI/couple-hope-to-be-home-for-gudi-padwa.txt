PUNE: The final test to verify the status of the first Covid-19 positive couple and their daughter from the city is now awaited. The family is hopeful that they will be home for Gudi Padwa on Wednesday. 

The couple said they are hoping to spend the Marathi new year at home. “I want to eat home cooked food now. I want to cook at home and there cannot be a better day than Gudi Padwa,” the wife said.

She said they were absolutely fine now and have no health complaints. “Our test results are awaited, and I wish to be home to celebrate the festival,” she told TOI.

The couple and their daughter have been off medication since 4-5 days after they showed good signs of improvement and there were no health complaints. All three are spending the mandatory protocol period at the hospital as laid down by the Union ministry of health for Covid-19.

“I feel that the day is very close when we will soon be out of hospital. We are feeling good, our swabs were taken on Monday morning for testing. We are confident that the results will be favourable and we will be discharged soon,” the wife added.

Doctors, who visited them in the morning, have told the family that once the reports are out, and all goes well, they will be informed a day in advance before the discharge. 

Public health expert Sanjeev Wavare, in-charge of Naidu hospital, said, “On March 9, two positive coronavirus cases were admitted. Their samples were sent to NIV today, the 14th day. These samples tested negative for the virus. We will send the second samples on Tuesday. If they also test negative, we will discharge them as per the protocol.”
