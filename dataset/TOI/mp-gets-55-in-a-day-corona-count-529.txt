2020-04-12
INDORE/BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh recorded 55 new cases on Saturday – the Covid-19 curve shooting up after being flat for two days. The state’s corona count is now 529, and with one more death in Indore during the day, MP’s toll has touched 40.

The bulk of the cases, again, were from Indore. Thirty-two new positive reports took its count to 281 – over half of the state’s number. The Indore administration’s report showed 17 more cases (total count 298), but these didn’t reflect in the state bulletin.

Bhopal had a comparatively better day after a weeklong scare, recording a dozen cases. The capital’s count is 131.

The Bhopal district administration on Saturday restricted movement on 43 roads, and ordered that areas around the homes of all 131 patients will be declared containment areas. Bhopal now has a whopping 131 localities as containment zones, and Indore 82.

Bhopal collector Tarun Pithode appealed to citizens to maintain a record of all the people they have met since the lockdown and also those they will be meeting from hereon.

Ratlam and Mandsaur were put on the Covid-19 map with their first cases, but hearteningly, several districts – including Ujjain, Khargone, Barwani, Kahndwa and Dhar – didn’t see any rise in their figures.

While one patient each recovered in Jabalpur and Bhopal, three patients were discharged from Ujjain. The number of patients who have recovered rose to 38 on Saturday.
