AURANGABAD: If the Covid-19 analysis report prepared by the civic administration is to be believed, the city is only second to Mumbai in per million Covid-19 testing. Authorities said that the rise in the number of cases was a result of increased testing. 


As per the data shared by municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, there was a surge in the number of new cases emerging from Aurangabad from April 27.

However, 42 Covid-19 positive cases were detected on April 27. 24, 10 and 47 cases were detected on April 28, 29 and 30 respectively. 

Pandey shared a graph that compared the positive cases with the tested samples. The graph analysing Covid-19 data of the city from March 15 to April 30 shows a direct relation between testing and positive cases. The lab reports received from GMCH of Covid-19 testing had risen by upto 900 a day on April 27.
