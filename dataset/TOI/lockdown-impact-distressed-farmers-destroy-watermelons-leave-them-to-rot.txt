Lockdown impact: Distressed farmers destroy watermelons, leave them to rot

HUBBALLI: Driven to despair by the consequences of coronavirus outbreak, watermelon growers in Hesaruru and surrounding villages in Mundargi taluk of Gadag district have destroyed their crops to save themselves from incurring further losses.


With no takers for their produce in the market due to lockdown, farmers on Sunday ploughed their watermelon fields with tractors uprooting the plants.

Speaking to TOI, Vishwanth Gaddad, a farmer in Hesaruru village said, “I had grown watermelon on four acres of land, investing Rs 88,000. A few days before the lockdown, some traders visited my field and agreed to buy watermelons for Rs 10,000 to 12,000 per tonne. We were expecting to get good returns this time as temperature is soaring high. But all our hopes have been dashed after the announcement for lockdown,” he said.

“Soon after the announcement, traders called to say that they won’t buy watermelons as markets have been shut down. We waited for a couple more days, but no one came to buy the melons. Finally, we had no option but to destroy the crops. Before doing that we allowed people to take as many melons as they could. Some farmers in the neighbouring villages too destroyed their crops in the same way,” he added.

“Only 20% of farmers who had done harvesting before the lockdown managed to sell their produce, while rest of us are now in great loss,” said another farmer.

In a neighbouring village, where watermelons grown on about 30 acres of land have been left to rot or destroyed by distressed farmers, said villagers.
