2020-04-04
Visakhapatnam: Responding to rumours on social media that since railway ticket bookings have resumed for dates after April 15, the lockdown will end the day before, the Railways on Friday issued a clarification saying that bookings had not stopped except for the lockdown period.

Speaking to TOI, G Suneel Kumar, senior divisional commercial manager, Waltair division of ECoR, said that advanced reservation period for tickets is 120 days and ticket bookings for April 15 and beyond began much before the lockdown was announced.

“Ticket bookings opening from April 15 does not mean that the lockdown will end on April 14. If the Centre extends the period further, the Railways can cancel reservations made from April 15,” Kumar said.

Meanwhile, the district administration too responded to the rumours about the lockdown period. “People should not believe rumours circulating through social media and unauthorised sources,” an official said.
