Hubballi: The carcass of a laggar falcon with a radio telemetry device tagged to its leg was found on a farm in Vambatnal in Vijayapura district on Sunday evening, creating panic among residents of the village and nearby areas. Already scared by the Covid-19 pandemic as Vijayapura is one of the worst hit districts in North Karnataka, residents feared that the carcass could be a mischievous attempt to spread the virus in their village.

The villagers believed the carcass was that of an eagle until forest department rushed to the spot and confirmed it to be a laggar falcon. Ashok Patil, deputy conservator of forest, Vijayapura, said the bird did not carry any virus. “We found the dead bird with radio telemetry transmitter and antenna tied to one of its legs. A team of veterinary officials visited the spot and confirmed the bird died three days back of natural causes. It didn’t carry any virus,” he said.

Dileep Yambatnal, a farmer, said the villagers are relieved after the forest department’s confirmation.

Patil said the battery-operated device fitted to the bird is manufactured in the USA and had no camera attached to it. “We also found a metallic tag. I’m personally investigating the matter and we have registered a case under the Wildlife Act and seized the transmitter and tag,” Patil said.

Patil said the issue has been brought to the notice of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Chennai, and Bombay Natural History Society for further investigation. “We are trying to find the purpose of using the transmitter,” he said.

Patil said these birds are usually used for study purpose in the USA and sporting activities in the Gulf countries. In India, the use of birds for sport and tagging devices to them is banned, he said.

Laggar falcons are found in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
