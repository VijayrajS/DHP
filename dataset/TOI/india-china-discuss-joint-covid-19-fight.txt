NEW DELHI: Amid the growing Covid-19 threat, India and China on Tuesday discussed cooperation to jointly fight the pandemic which has killed more than 17,000 worldwide. 


Foreign minister S Jaishankar tweeted that he and his counterpart Wang Yi discussed working together and agreed to build further on bilateral efforts. The two also spoke about the upcoming G20 summit. India had earlier sent a planeload of relief supplies to coronavirus-hit Hubei province as a mark of solidarity with China.

Chinese ambassador to India Sun Weidong on Twitter said the two ministers expressed sympathy and solidarity with India in its fight against Covid-19 and that China was ready to share its experience, provide assistance within its capacity and “open its channel for procurement to India”. 

He tweeted that Wang said in his conversation with Jaishankar that “it’s not acceptable and detrimental to international cooperation to label the 
virus and stigmatise China, hope India opposes such narrow mindset”.
