AMARAVATI: Deputy chief minister (health) Alla Nani on Wednesday said the state government has readied a comprehensive plan to contain Covid-19 in Krishna, Guntur and Kurnool districts.

He said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed them to initiate more measures to handle the situation and control the virus spread.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday after the meeting of Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19, Nani said the district collectors have been directed to take over as many private hospitals as possible to provide treatment to Covid-19 patients in the three districts.

He said that special teams have been deputed to trace and track the sources of the cases in the districts. 

“The government is fully geared up to tackle the situation in Krishna, Guntur and Kurnool districts where a high number of positive cases are being reported. We are confident of handling the crisis,” said Nani.

He said that they would provide best possible treatment to all the positive cases and see that all of them returned home safely.

Agriculture minister Kannababu criticized former CM Chandrababu Naidu for politicizing Covid-19 operations in the state. He said that Naidu is making baseless allegations on raithu bharosa beneficiaries. He said that the government would release raithu bharosa amounts to the farmers on May 15 and cover all eligible farmers.
