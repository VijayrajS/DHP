2020-03-29
RAJKOT: Two persons including a married woman committed suicide in Jamnagar on Saturday, allegedly driven by fears over the nationwide lockdown imposed by the central government to contain novel coronavirus spread. 


The first case was reported from Gokulnagar locality of Jamnagar, where a 21-year-old carpenter, identified as Kaushik Mandera, hanged himself from the ceiling fan in his house on Saturday morning.

“Mandera used to work as a carpenter in Rajkot. After the outbreak of coronavirus, Mandera had returned to his native Jamnagar, where after the lockdown he was forced to stay indoors. In his suicide note, Mandera said that as he was sick and tired of being confined to his house and therefore decided to end his life,” said R R Verma, investigating officer, Jamnagar C-division police station.

In the second case reported from Dared GIDC adjoining Jamnagar city, a 20-year-old woman, identified as Neha Kathiriya, hanged to death from the ceiling of her house on Friday evening.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Kathiriya was extremely upset after her brother-in-law told her husband over phone from Surat that he along with his family members were coming to their house to stay. They told her husband that due to the lockdown there was no work in Surat.

“Kathiriya feared that her brother-in-law and his family members from Surat might have been infected with Covid-19 and she lodged a strong protest with her husband Piyush. However, he did not accept her demand and said he would welcome the relatives. This drove Kathiriya to take the drastic step,” said H B Pandav, assistant sub-inspector with Jamnagar Panchkoshi B-division police station.
