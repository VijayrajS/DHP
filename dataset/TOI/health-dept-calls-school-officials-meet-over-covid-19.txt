2020-02-19
Thrissur: The district health department convened an emergency meeting of headmasters of schools in Thrissur at the district collectorate on Tuesday to allay concerns over the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) scare.

Disaster management deputy collector M C Rejil presided over the meeting. Over 40 school officials, Arogya Keralam district programme manager T V Satheeshan, Ardram assistant Nodal officer N S Rana and mass media officer P A Haritha Devi were part of the meeting. DMO K J Reena gave a brief description about the disease.

To allay the fears, teachers and PTA officials will be counselled; PHCs near the schools should provide assistance to the awareness campaign, said officials. “The school authorities should provide support to the kids who return to school after home quarantine. The officials should not isolate the kids from other students of the school,” officials said. 

Last week, the district administration and health officials disclosed that one school and a college in the district had shown reluctance to take back students who had returned after the coronavirus quarantine period.
