Andhra Pradesh: Members pull out savings to feed poor during lockdown
2020-05-02
VIJAYAWADA: Members of the transgender community have taken out their savings for the cause of filling empty stomachs in the state during the ongoing lockdown.


“Though we saved some money for future, the difficulty of migrant workers and street children due to the lockdown has become unbearable for us. We can’t sit idle and decided to spend our savings to provide meals to the needy,” said Hasini Manikala, a member of the transgender community.

“We started feeding the needy in Kadapa district and later we started in Kurnool, Chittoor and Anantapur districts and our community members in Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and few other districts of Andhra Pradesh have launched the distribution of food. We have been feeding over 3,000 to 4,000 people in a day for the past two weeks,” said Manikala, who formed the Hasini Association, which has over 1,300 transgenders as its members.

“Since migrant workers are not in a position to prepare food, we have been preparing steamed vegetable rice, egg curry, mixed vegetable curry and distributing the food packets, including curd and banana,” said Tonny, a transgender man.

Commending the efforts of the community during the crisis, police said members of the transgender community wear masks and are following social distancing while distributing food.
