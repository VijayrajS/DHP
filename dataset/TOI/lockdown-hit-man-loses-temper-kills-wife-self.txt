2020-04-11
RAJKOT: Frayed tempers are the worst nightmare stressing many a household across the globe leading to severe instances of domestic violence. A similar breakdown resulted in the murder-suicide of a 60-year-old man who allegedly strangled his wife before committing suicide in Jamnagar city on Thursday night.


Police said the accused, Mohan Rathod (60), allegedly strangled his wife Rami (57), using a rope at his residence in Hanuman Tekari area of Jamnagar. After this, he went into another room and ended his life by hanging himself to death from the ceiling fan. Before committing suicide, Rathod wrote on the wall that he had taken both the drastic steps.

Rathod was booked on the complaint by his elder son Hasmukh (27), who said that he had gone to stay with his sister after his father thrashed him on Wednesday. Upon his return on Friday morning, he found the door of the house locked from inside.


Rathod was responsible for his son’s divorce

He gained access into the house by jumping from the gallery of an adjoining house and found his father hanging in his room, while in the other room his mother was lying dead. Rathod was engaged in labour work at construction sites. “In his complaint, Hasmukh said that his father was extremely ill-tempered, who frequently picked up quarrels with his family members. Unable to tolerate the father-in-law’s nature, even Hasmukh’s wife had divorced him. 

The man would often beat his wife Rami, Hasmukh and his younger son Ramesh (22),” said MJ Jalu, inspector, Jamnagar police. “The lockdown had only aggravated Rathod's agitated mental state, alleged Hasmukh in his complaint. Hasmukh said that Rathod must have murdered his wife in a fit of rage and then committed suicide out of guilt,” added Jalu.
