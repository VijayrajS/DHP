Police fanned out on various roads across the city and put up barricades. At least half a dozen police personnel were deployed near major junctions. TOI spotted motorists had a tough time passing through the barricades as the police advised them to turn back. 

At many places, traffic police stopped the motorists for long time as ‘punishment’ for violating the prohibitory orders. Among the violators were even some policemen , confirmed deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Vikram Sali.
