Uncertainty shrouds Indo-China trade through Lipulekh due to Covid-19
2020-04-11
Pithoragarh:The outbreak of novel coronavirus has cast clouds of uncertainty over the annual Indo-China border trade through Lipukekh pass. 

Due to the on-going lockdown, traders have not been able to make arrangements for the border trade. 

Khermsnand Bhatt, assistant trade officer, told TOI, “Some activities relating to the Indo-China border trade, conducted under supervision of Union ministry of external affairs, started in the first week of this month but we haven’t received any official communication regarding it.”

Rajendra Singh Raypa, a trader, told TOI, “We haven’t started preparations for the annual border trade as we don’t know whether it will happen this year or not. Due to coronavirus pandemic, we haven’t even purchased our stock yet. Traders are likely to suffer massive losses this year.”

Another local trader told TOI that livelihood of several families depend on this border trade and the government must make sure that it is conducted smoothly. 

“Last year, 265 trade passes were issued. As many as 69 traders and 196 helpers took part in the annual trade. India exported goods worth Rs 33 lakh and imported goods worth Rs 1.25 crore. In 2019, this border trade started from the first week of June and culminated on October 31,” Bhatt added.

Notably, the annual trade through Lipukekh pass is going on since 1992 following an agreement between India and China. For this trade, Indian traders go to Taklakot mart in China and Chinese traders come to Gunji mart in India.
