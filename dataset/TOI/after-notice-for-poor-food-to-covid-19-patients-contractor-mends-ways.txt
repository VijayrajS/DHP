After notice for poor food to Covid-19 patients, contractor mends ways
2020-05-24
BAREILLY: Two days after, Bareilly's chief medical officer (CMO) served a notice on a contractor for supplying low quality food to patients under treatment at the community health centre in Bithri Chainpur, designated as Covid-19 level one hospital, the meals have improved. Patients themselves vouched for getting better food.

Vineet Shukla, CMO, said the contractor was to provide a proper "thali" for lunch and dinner but he was supplying only vegetables with some chapatis. 

According to officials, the contractor was supplying bread without butter for breakfast while pulses and rice were missing from lunch and dinner. 

The matter came to the fore after a few patients complained about poor food during a telephonic conversation with a state minister.

Dr Shukla said, “Though no special contract was made for Covid-19 patients, the contractor has to supply breakfast, lunch and dinner according to the contract terms of the Janni Suraksha Yojana (JSY). 

However, as the quality of food supplied here was not up to the mark, we have served notice on the contractor, who has since improved quality of food. Besides, we have started providing fruits and milk through other sources to the patients.”
