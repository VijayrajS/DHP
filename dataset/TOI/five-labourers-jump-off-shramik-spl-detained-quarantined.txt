BAREILLY: Exposing their life to serious danger, five labourers returning home from Punjab on Sitapur-bound Shramik Special jumped off when the train entered Roza railway station in Shahjahanpur district on Sunday. They were, however, detained by GRP in-charge Vinod Tiwari and his team, and taken to a quarantine centre. Their samples would be sent for Covid-19 tests. Luckily, no one sustained any injury.

The Shramik Special carrying the migrant labourers from Ludhiana to Sitapur had slowed down while changing tracks as it was closing in on the railway station. This allowed the men from Allahaganj area of Shahjahanpur to jump off.

One of the labourers said, “We had already spent a long time on the train. And it would have taken us another three hours to reach Sitapur and then would have reached Shahjahanpur by evening. So, we decided to jump off the train.”

GRP in-charge Tiwari told TOI, “We stay on alert whenever any special train passes by. There is always a possibility that a passenger may jump off. It happened in the past as well. Five labourers jumped off the running train on Sunday and tried to flee, but we stopped them. They were all carrying valid tickets and no FIR has been registered against them. They were handed over to SHO of Roza police station.”

SHO Ashok Pal said, “All the labourers were working at woollen factories in Ludhiana. Since they were coming from another state, we have sent them to quarantine centre.”

A similar incident was reported at Roza railway station on May 8.
