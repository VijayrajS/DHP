2020-03-23
Jaipur: The 80 community centres across the city are being prepared to be upgraded into quarantine wards in case of an emergency. Jaipur Municipal Corporation, which was asked to identify structures which can be used as quarantine wards, is now cleaning up and disinfecting the community centres.

At present, the city has two centres for quarantine – RUHS and SMS Hospital. There more than 600 beds in both the places. 

JMC additional commissioner Arun Garg confirmed that the community centres would be used in case of emergency. “We are keeping them on stand-by in case the number of people suffering from coronavirus increase. We have looked into the arrangements that need to be made – lights, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities. Extra precautions have been maintained to keep the things in control and keep these buildings ready on short notice,” said Garg. 

Many of the 80 community centres lack toilet facilities and some are not in proper shape. There have been complaints of lack of hygiene and sanitation in the centres as well. 

An official said these centres are usually located in residential areas where people may object to keeping the patients over there. “Almost all the community centres are situated in the centre of colonies and we fear that people may object of using them as isolation wards. However, in case of emergency, these are the only options for us. They will be properly covered and packed from all the sides for to prevent spreading of the virus,” said a JMC official. 

The civic body has started disinfecting many areas in the city including the community centres. At present, 30 teams are busy disinfecting public places for which the JMC had procured 1% sodium hydrochloride solution. Most of the malaria staff of JMC is busy in disinfection work.
