MADURAI: With Covid-19 pandemic in limelight, for World Asthma Day, observed on May 5 every year, there is a need for more awareness and prevention of asthma.

According to studies, in India, around 18 million cases of asthma are reported every year. Asthma is a condition in which a person’s airways become inflamed, narrow and swollen and produce extra mucus, which makes it difficult to breathe. Asthma can be minor or in some cases, it may lead to a life-threatening attack. “Nearly half the outpatients that pulmonologists see are generally asthma patients. Asthma may cause difficulty in breathing, chest pain, cough and wheezing. The condition is primarily episodic and mainly is triggered by exposure to allergens like dust, smoke, pollen or certain kind of chemicals,” said Dr P Prem Ananth, a consultant interventional pulmonologist.

According to doctors, asthma cases have declined amid lockdown because of less exposure to allergens. “Generally cases are less in summers and now with lockdown in place, pollution is less. People are naturally not exposed to as much dust or smoke from traffic by not going outdoors,” added Dr. Ananth. Most asthma patients also tend to have family history of asthma or allergies of some kind, he added.

“A major difference in symptoms between asthma and Covid-19 is fever and body pain. Asthma patients need to be extra careful about Covid-19 as any co-morbid illness means an increased risk,” explained Dr Ananth.
