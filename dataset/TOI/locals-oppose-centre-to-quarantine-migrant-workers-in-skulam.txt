Rajam (Srikakulam): Tension prevailed at Dolapeta in Srikakulam district on Friday when police resorted to lathi charge to disperse people who were opposing a quarantine facility in their area. Several people, including a few women, received minor injuries in the police action.

The district administration had arranged a quarantine centre to house about 200 migrant labourers who were brought there in four buses from Ravulapalem in East Godavari district on Friday morning. District officials said around 10,000 migrant labourers are likely to reach the district in the next week. 

“We can’t send them directly to their villages even though the preliminary screening was done at Ravulapalem before they boarded the buses. Here we will conduct a proper screening and keep them for a few days in quarantine. This is a procedure and we have to follow it,” said a district official.

When the buses reached Dolapeta on Friday morning, locals, including several women, protested and blocked the road. They did not allow the labourers into the government school that has been converted into a quarantine centre. They stopped the buses and kept arguing with the officials who tried to persuade them for almost three hours.

District SP Ammireddy said the police faced stiff opposition from locals. “Locals fear the migrant labourers may spread the virus. But none of them have tested positive for Covid-19, and they do not need to fear,” he said.
