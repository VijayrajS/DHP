Robot to serve drugs and food to coronavirus patients in SMS hospital
2020-03-26
JAIPUR: A robot was brought to Sawai Man Singh Hospital for providing medicine and food to the Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment here on Wednesday.



A private firm has provided the robot to the SMS Hospital on voluntary basis to help the nursing staff and doctors to maintain distance from the Covid-19 patients.

“The work of providing medicines and food, which is done by nursing staff and doctors at the hospital, will be done by a robot for Covid-19 patients. However, to check its efficiency first, we are going to have a demo. If the robot is found useful and does the work efficiently, we will use it to provide medicines and food to Covid-19 patients,” said Dr D S Meena, superintendent, SMS Hospital. Dr Meena said there are higher chances of doctors getting infected from the virus, so it is always a wise idea not to get in touch with the Covid-19 patients frequently; in that case, this robot is useful.

The robot is designed in such a way that it has a tray which is useful for carrying food and medicine from one place to another. Nursing staff were happy to see the robot moving on its own and carrying objects along with it.

However, at the corona out-patient department, patients kept pouring in on Wednesday. The hospital OPD registered 403 influenza-like illness patients, among those 40 are suspected Covid-19 patients.
