Helpline to help kids cope with lockdown trauma
2020-05-19
Mysuru: The biggest victims of the pandemic are children with several side-effects on their physical and psychological well-being, say experts.

Fearing that children may need more counselling due to increased cases of child abuse, anxiety, trafficking and lockdown trauma, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KCPCR) has launched a dedicated helpline.

Under the new arrangement, the state has been divided into 7 divisions which will be taken care of by the commission members, coordinators and district child protection officers. The first lockdown saw Child Helpline 1098 flooded with complaints on child marriages in villages. 

KCPCR chairman Antony Sebastian, says the commission is expecting to see a spike in cases of violation of child rights in the post lockdown scenario. "From child trafficking, to child marriages, child labourers, school drop out, children are likely to face a lot of emotional issues. The financial setback to parents is sure to affect children too. To ensure that children will not face any problems due to Covid-19 related challenges, we launched this helpline. Once the complaint is registered our members, coordinators and officials from various government departmenst will extend necessary help to the children," he explained.

Children who need help and public can contact 080 47181177 which operates with IVR support from 10 am to 5pm.

According to child rights activist G Nagasihma Rao, the lockdown period saw the helpline flooded with complaints. "This helpline has been launched in convergence with various government departments and so is bound to be effective," he said.
