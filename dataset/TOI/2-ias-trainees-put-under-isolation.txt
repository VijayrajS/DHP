DEHRADUN: Two IAS trainees of Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA), one of whom had met the IFS trainee officer who was later found to be Covid-19 positive on Sunday, have been isolated by the institution. Director of LBSNAA Sanjeev Chopra told TOI that the institute is taking all precautionary measures.


DEHRADUN"The two IAS trainees, who were roommates, are under self-isolation in a hostel room, which is not being used by anyone else. One of them had visited IGNFA over the weekend. They will have remote access to academic sessions within their rooms. Thus far, neither of the two has shown any symptoms of the disease," Chopra said.
