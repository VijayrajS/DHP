Bagalkot: Health minister Sreeramulu assured that there will be no issue in providing the necessary medical equipment and supplies for the Covid-19 pandemic. He chaired a meeting of district level officials in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic at the DC’s office conference hall on Wednesday. He said,“Not a single positive case has been found in the district so far. Action will be taken if anyone tests positive for Covid-19 in the future.” Bagalkot city MLA Veeranna Charantimath said that a demand has been made for necessary medical supplies and equipment to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. They should be dispatched immediately, he said. 

Charantimath said that each district should have a testing centre for Covid-19, instead of sending swabs to Bengaluru. “There is not a single laboratory in North Karnataka where a person can get tested for Covid-19. Even though the government made an announcement about setting up a laboratory at Hubballi and Belgavi, but they are yet to be opened.” 

After the meeting, Sreeramulu visited the district hospital and inspected the special wards set up for Covid-19 patients.
