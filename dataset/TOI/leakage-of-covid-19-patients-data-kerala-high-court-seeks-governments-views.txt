2020-05-06
KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Tuesday asked the state government to respond to a petition highlighting the alleged leakage of data of Covid-19 patients at Kasaragod.

A division bench comprising justices Shaji P Chaly and Ashok Menon sought the government’s views during the admission hearing on a petition filed by Himdad P Aboobacker of Kasaragod.

It was alleged in the petition that data of Covid-19 patients, who availed treatment, had leaked and that no action was taken despite filing a complaint to the district medical officer.

The patients had furnished their names and addresses only at the government general hospital, where they availed treatment but when they returned home after treatment, they were contacted by a private firm in Bengaluru over phone seeking details, the petition said.

Leakage of data of patients violate their right to privacy and a probe is required into the leakage of data, the petitioner had contended. During the hearing, the court asked whether the petitioner was a Covid-19 patient. The petitioner’s counsel responded that though his client was not a patient, his phone number was given when he took patients to the hospital. Asking the government to respond to the petition, the court has scheduled further hearing on May 11.
