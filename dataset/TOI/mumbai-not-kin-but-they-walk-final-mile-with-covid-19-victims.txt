Mumbai: Not kin, but they walk final mile with Covid-19 victims
2020-05-27
MUMBAI: A Muslim family from the western suburbs recently refused to claim the body of a 63-year-old family member who died of Covid-19 due to fear of contracting the virus. That same week, a Gujarati family from Central Mumbai was reluctant to perform the last rites of their family member, a 56-year-old Covid victim. 


The task force of the Raza Academy not only claimed the bodies on behalf of the families, but also buried and cremated the deceased according to their religious practices. In the past month and a half, task force volunteers have buried/cremated 448 Covid victims, including over 50 Hindus.

BMC has granted permission to the task force, an initiative of Raza Academy, Juma Masjeed Trust, and guardian minister Aslam Shaikh, to facilitate the last rites of Covid victims.

"In the initial days of the pandemic in March, we noticed people were not ready to claim or cremate/bury the dead due to fear. Hence, we proposed taking over the responsibility. The BMC appointed a task force comprising three members to coordinate the task," said Sabir Nirban, a builder, who is part of the task force along with Suheb Khatib and Irfan Shaikh.

Soon after, the BMC asked the task force if they would handle the last rites of Hindu victims, and they agreed. The nearly 70-member team of volunteers comprises businessmen, builder, traders and wholesalers. All the expenses are borne by them too. The task force has put up their numbers in major hospitals. As soon as they get a call, a five-member team responds within an hour. While three members reach the hospital to claim the body, two others reach the cemetery to make arrangements for the burial. Each of them has PPE kits, sanitizers etc.

"The entire team was fasting throughout the month of Ramzan, yet they continued to work. Even on Eid, they buried 14 bodies of Muslims and cremated seven Hindu victims," said Shaikh.
