Lucknow: Nine more railway cops tested positive for novel coronavirus infection on Sunday, while 65 Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel were quarantined, taking the total number of those in quarantine to 125, more than 50% of the total strength of security personnel deployed at Charbagh railway station.

Total 13 persons were diagnosed with Covid-19, of which eight were GRP personnel and one Railway Protection Force (RPF) jawan. Besides, two family members of a constable, found infected earlier, also tested positive as did the daughter of a deceased Covid-19 patient in Barood Khana, Golaganj as well as a man in Jankipuram.

Total 16 GRP and two RPF personnel deployed at railway station to oversee security, crowd control and ensuring social distancing, screening of migrants arriving in Shramik Special trains, have been found to be infected so far. Of 240 GRP jawans posted at GRP Charbagh, 60 have been quarantined over the past four days while 65 were put in isolation on Sunday, leaving the police station with just 115 personnel, less than half of its total strength.

Superintendent of Police, GRP, Saumitra Yadav said, “As a precautionary measure, all the constables living in barracks have been sent to quarantine.” When asked about impending manpower crisis, additional director general of police, railways, Sanjay Singhal said, “The frequency of Shramik Special trains has come down now, hence we can manage with present strength of jawans.”

“And in case an emergency arises, we have put GRP cops posted in Barabanki and Unnao on the standby,” he added.
