Covid-19 threat: As abhyasikas close down, Maharashtra Public Service Commission students demand postponing of exams
2020-03-17
PUNE: Most students studying for public services examinations have left for their native places as fear of coronavirus led to the closure of study centres or abhyasikas in the city.

The Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) Students Rights Committee, an organisation of MPSC aspirants, said that 70% of the students have left Pune. However, the next major MPSC examination (for the post of tehsildar, among others) is scheduled on April 5, which many students feel should be postponed. Almost all students had opted for Pune as their examination centre.

Kiran Nimbhore, a member of the MPSC Students Rights organisation, said, “There is a fear among students as most of them who prepare for the MPSC exam stay in cramped spaces. We either eat at the mess or order tiffin services and generally from morning till late at night most of us are at libraries or study centres. With many libraries/reading rooms shut, we don’t have any other place where we can study. Hence, 70% of us have gone home. The remaining are studying here.”

Another MPSC aspirant, Vishva, who was on his way home, said that trouble will start when all students start returning. “There is an examination scheduled on April 5 and that is a crucial examination for the state service. Since most students have opted for Pune as their exam centre, there is going to be overcrowding and more chances of contracting the virus,” he said.

Kishore Choure, coordinator, Maharashtra Abhyasika, said that all business related to students has witnessed a slump. “Most students have left for their homes. It is indeed a big loss for all of us. The students lose out on a good place to study and we lose out on rent. Those who run the mess also lose out on business. But what can be done? This is a necessary precaution we need to take,” said Choure.
