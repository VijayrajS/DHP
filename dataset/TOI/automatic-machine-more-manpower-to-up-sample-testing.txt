Indore: MGM virology has been trying different ways to increase its capacity. The lab began with testing of one sample on March 21 and tested around 320 samples on April 22 with 188 others under process in PCR stage.

The authorities have completed installation of one fully automatic RNA extraction machine and have also trained 10 assistant professors of microbiology department in RNA extraction and using them to reduce testing time.

Both these steps were taken following directions of a four-member NCDC team, which inspected the facility on April 16 on directions of Union government.

Dr Shikha Ghanghoriya, nodal officer in charge of virology lab said, “We are aiming to test anything above 480 samples a day. We are trying to consistently increase the testing capacity. The installation of one fully automated RNA extraction machine is helping us a lot.” 

Now, we can extract RNA of 96 samples at one go within couple of hours, said Ghanghoriya. The 10 assistant professors of microbiology department are also helping us in RNA extraction on two manual machines, said Ghanghoriya.

Dean Dr Jyoti Bindal had earlier said, “For three four days after April 17, the installation process of automatic RNA extraction machine and precautionary quarantining of staff members of lab affected testing capacity.” But, now we are back to normal and focusing on increasing testing, added Bindal.
