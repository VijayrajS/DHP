VISAKHAPATNAM: The state had introduced the telemedicine programme to continue providing healthcare facilities to patients even during pandemics, said Dr D Raghunatha Rao, founder director of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital & Research Centre.


Sharing his views about YSR Telemedicine here on Wednesday, Dr Rao said that the guidelines were framed with the sole purpose of enabling registered medical practitioners to treat patients with non-coronavirus ailments. 

“The programme aims to ensure uninterrupted medical consultation to every single patient along with provision of home delivery of drugs for all common ailments and to pick up any patient with symptoms that might be indicative of coronavirus infection and quickly get help to the doorstep of the patient,” Dr Rao said.

YSR Arogyasree Trust was given the task of strengthening the programme and it prepared an online application system and roped-in all willing specialists already enrolled under Arogyasree schemes, trained them online to address patients on three shifts a day, from 8 am to 6 pm.

Dr Rao said, “The success of this telemedicine programme is immeasurable. It not only brought succour to distressed patients with various ailments, but also identified how efficiently Covid-19 patients could be identified, screened and cared for.”

“It is a fore runner of how health can now be brought to the doorstep with precision, certainty and at a lower cost for several chronic, lifestyle disorders like diabetes, hypertension, stroke, renal failure, rheumatic disorders, seizures, psychiatric disorder, etc that do not need more than two to three visits to a specialist or hospital in a year,” added Dr Rao.
