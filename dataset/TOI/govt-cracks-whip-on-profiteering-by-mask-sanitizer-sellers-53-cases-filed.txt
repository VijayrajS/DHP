D L Parmar, controller, legal metrology department, said on Wednesday that masks and sanitizers have been brought under the Essential Commodities Act and steps are being taken to regularize supply of masks and sanitizers. “Every medical store, dealer or manufacturer has to publicly display the stock of masks and sanitizers that are available on a daily basis. We have asked all district collectors and our field officers to file daily reports on the action being taken against those who are tampering with MRP of sanitizers and masks,” Parmar said.

The official added that compounding fee of more than Rs 1.50 lakh has been recovered as part of the drive. Despite the drive by the government, hand sanitizers are still not available at a majority of medical stores in the city.
