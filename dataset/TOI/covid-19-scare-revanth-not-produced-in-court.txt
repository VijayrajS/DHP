Covid-19 scare: A Revanth Reddy not produced in court
2020-03-18
HYDERABAD: With the coronavirus fear spreading to courts, Congress MP A Revanth Reddy was not produced before the principal special judge of ACB court in Hyderabad on Tuesday in connection with the vote-for-note scam.


The judge posted the case to April 20. Revanth, one of the prime accused, was caught by ACB sleuths in May 2015. He was arrested in another case and sent to judicial remand. 

The same was informed to the ACB court which did not insist on his production because the Telangana high court had already instructed all the trial courts to not insist on production of the accused and also to not pass any adverse orders for failing to produce the accused. 

The high court itself has directed the district judiciary to ensure that there are no crowds in the trial courts in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

ACB filed a chargesheet in the case charging Revanth with trying to bribe an independent legislator with Rs 50 lakh to make him vote for a TDP nominee in the 2015 MLC elections. ACB raided the premises where the alleged transaction took place, arrested Revanth and seized the cash. 

ACB is supposed to get this voice sample tested at FSL and get to the source of the seized cash. Whether ACB could do these things in the last five years would be known in the forthcoming hearings of the case.
