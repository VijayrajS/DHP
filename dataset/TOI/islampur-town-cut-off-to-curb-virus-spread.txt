Kolhapur: Sangli district guardian minister Jayant Patil on Saturday ordered that the borders of Islampur town should be sealed to curb the possible spread of novel coronavirus.

Patilâ€™s order comes in the wake 23 positive patients being reported from Islampur and one of their relative from Kolhapur. Patil held a review meeting with the local administration on Saturday.

In the first step, the administration cordoned off the area, where these patients reside. However, later, the entire town was closed off.

Officials said that only one person from one family will be allowed to come to the streets with proper identification card. The person will be allowed to leave home only to purchase essential commodities. Stern action would be taken against those who move around without authentic identity, officials said. 

District collector Abhijit Chowdhary has asked the police to have stringent check of all the vehicles, which were coming in the district despite sealing of the borders. The order has been issued as administration has noticed that large number of people were coming to the district by vehicles, which were involved in transportation of essential commodities. Collector has asked to act against vehicle driver and owner and the people travelling in the vehicle.

Through another order, Chowdhary has ordered industrial establishments to provide all the essentials to the employees, who are from outside Maharashtra, 

This order is also applicable to the cane cutting workers, who have migrated to Sangli district because of crushing season of the sugar mills. The order has been issued to ensure that cane cutting labour do not travel to their native places.
