Ahmedabad: The lockdown situation in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic has not only caused financial stress but also led to mental illness issues. 

A study conducted recently by a team of experts points out that there has been a rise of about 25% in mental illness.

Addiction related problems have also gone up by 18%, while domestic violence has seen a rise of 9.5%. Problems arising due to the matters related to religion are up by 2.1%, it said. 

The study has been carried out by Gujarat Psychological Intervention Helplines (GPIH). It has been formed by a team of 150 members which includes medical college lecturers and professional psychologists. The GPIH runs 10 helplines. Its findings are based on the counselling sessions of 40,350 persons across Gujarat.

On May 7, the GPIH wrote to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani that the mental conditions of people during the lockdown was worrisome. The group of experts has advised the chief minister to think of measures beyond the lockdown to curb Covid-19 pandemic. 

It also suggested that rehabilitation and de-addiction centres be allowed to open to treat patients as the unavailability of tobacco or other addictions during the lockdown can lead to severe physical and mental issues.
