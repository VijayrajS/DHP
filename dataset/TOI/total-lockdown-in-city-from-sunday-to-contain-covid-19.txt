Coimbatore: The state government on Friday announced complete lockdown in the city corporation limit for four days beginning 6 am on Sunday. The move is to control the spread of Covid-19 infection by completely restricting the movement of public.District collector K Rajamani said, “the corporation borders would be completely sealed and no one would be allowed to cross the border for any reason other than medical emergencies. The measures taken in the corporation limit to restrict public movement would be intensified further.” He said his administration would ensure that essential commodities – vegetables, fruits and milk – are made available to the general public. Both markets and mobile vegetable vehicles would be allowed to function for a stipulated time, he said, adding that steps would be taken to ensure that vegetables reach those in the containment zones. “No shops other than medical outlets would be allowed to remain open. If people are found gathering at medical shops for absurd reasons, stern action would be taken both against people and shopkeepers,” he said. All necessary steps would be taken to ensure that food distribution to migrant workers continues without any interruption, he added.Police commissioner Sumit Sharan said as many as 1,200 police personnel would be deployed across the corporation limit and only ambulances and people with medical emergencies would be allowed to travel. The deployed personnel have been directed to verify medical prescriptions in case of doubts and to ensure that people travel only to the nearest medical shops. “If people are coming out deliberately, they would be booked and their vehicles would be seized. If anyone is found to be coming out for the second time, they would be arrested and remanded to judicial custody,” he added.
