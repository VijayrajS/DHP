2020-05-29
MANGALURU/UDUPI: Covid-19 graph of the two coastal districts continued to zoom with Udupi and Dakshina Kannada accounting for 53 of the 115 cases that Karnataka reported on Thursday. Udupi recorded 29 of the 53 new cases with majority of them being people who entered the district from Maharashtra. The case was no different in DK with all 24 cases being people who came from Mumbai.

Minister S Suresh Kumar said the situation was all but expected once the government decided to allow people settled in other states to return. He allayed concerns over community transmission.

Pankaj Pandey, commissioner, department of health and family welfare, said the testing laboratories in two coastal districts are doing their best to handle the swabs they are receiving. There are atleast six ICMR approved laboratories in the two districts and there was a delay in receiving approval for the lab in Manipal which has led to little delay in getting the samples from Udupi tested, he said.

Active cases in Udupi now standing at149 and Dakshina Kannada at 63. Amidst the gloom that galloping positive cases brought, a bright spot was the discharge of 10 patients from Dakshina Kannada district during the day. Total number of patients discharged from the district so far is 39.
