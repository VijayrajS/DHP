SECUNDERABAD: Amid lockdown restrictions, Shyam Kumar, a former member of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) celebrated his birthday party along with a dozen people outside his office. The party was allegedly attended by a local sanitation official and was close to the Trimulgherry police station. 

Photos of the party on social media drew criticism from many. “In spite of Birthday party (being) hosted opp to Trimulgherry PS no action (was) taken by police,” one user tweeted. Tagging the SCB, he said the violation occurred in presence of health inspector BM Tripathi. However, when contacted, Shyam Kumar said: “I made a mistake and this party should not have been hosted in the current situation.” Speaking to TOI, SCB sanitation inspector BM Tripathi said: “Sometimes people give sweets to thank us. Maybe an impromptu celebration was held. How can we prevent this?” Trimulgherry SHO Ravi Kumar said he did not know such a party was held. “We have not received any complaint.”
