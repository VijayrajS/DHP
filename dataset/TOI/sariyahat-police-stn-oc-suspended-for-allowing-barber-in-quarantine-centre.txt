Dumka: Dumka SP Ambar Lakda on Sunday suspended the officer-in-charge of Saraiyahat police station, Sanjay Janak Murti, for dereliction of duty when a barber was allowed to enter a quarantine centre here to shave the head of an inmate, who later tested positive for Covid-19. 

The incident happened in between May 2 and 5, when two migrants, who returned from Gurgaon in Harayana, were lodged at the quarantine centre. 

A local barber was called to the centre to shave the head of one of the migrants, whose father had died. Later, when their test results came on May 5, both tested positive. Lakda said, “The barber’s entry into the quarantine centre was a clear violation of government orders issued in the backdrop of the pandemic and thus, the OC, who was in charge of the centre, has been suspended.”
