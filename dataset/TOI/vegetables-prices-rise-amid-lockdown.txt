2020-03-24
HYDERABAD: The surge in purchases resulted in a hike in vegetable prices across the city with some vendors in Kukatpally charging as high as Rs 100 for a kilo of tomatoes. Consumers forming serpentine queues to buy vegetables was the order of the day on Monday.


Prices of other essential vegetables such as onions, potatoes, beans and bitter gourd also saw an increase. “Prices of vegetables have shot up drastically in Rythu Bazars and retail outlets too. The average price of all vegetables has increased by 3 to 4 folds,” rued a houswife in Kukatpally market. 

Meanwhile, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has asked the authorities to see to it that poorer sections are not affected by the spike in the prices. TNN
