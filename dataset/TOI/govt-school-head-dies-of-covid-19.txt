NEW DELHI: After the death of an English teacher earlier this week, a principal of a Delhi government school in Kalyanpuri died due to Covid-19. The principal was deputed at a meal distribution centre since the anti-coronavirus lockdown began.

Fifty-seven-year-old Ompal Singh was a principal at Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Kalyanpuri. He was admitted to GTB Hospital on June 5. The vice-principal of the school, Shyam Lal, said: “Other members of Singh’s family have also been admitted to hospitals. Today morning, however, his son tested negative so he came and performed the last rites.”

Earlier this week, Shivji Mishra, an English teacher in a government school had succumbed to the disease. He had also been working at a relief centre during the lockdown.

These cases have now left teachers worried and they’ve been demanding that their duty at relief centres be stopped. According to Government School Teachers Association (GSTA), there are around 400 teachers who are in isolation. “We hope that the government will fulfill their promise and provide compensation of Rs 1 crore to these teachers as they died in line of duty,” said Ajay Yadav, the general secretary of GSTA.
