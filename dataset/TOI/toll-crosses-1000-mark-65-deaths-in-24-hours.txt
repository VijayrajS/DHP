NEW DELHI: The death toll due to Covid-19 in Delhi crossed the 1,000-mark on Thursday to reach 1,085. Of the 101 fatalities confirmed by the state health authorities, 65 deaths were confirmed in the last 24 hours.


The total number of cases of Covid-19 mounted to 34,687 with 1,877 new cases — the highest for a single day — being confirmed on Thursday.

Delhi has the maximum Covid-19 cases in the country, after Maharashtra (97,648) and Tamil Nadu (38,716). In terms of fatalities also, the capital ranks third with 1,085 Covid-19 deaths. Maharashtra (3,590) has the highest number of fatalities followed by Gujarat (1,385).

Delhi recorded its first Covid-19 death on March 13 when a 69-year-old woman from Janakpuri succumbed to the disease at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. The second death was reported in the national capital on March 28, the last for the month. With increase in cases, fatalities also continued to increase thereafter. As per government data, 57, 414 and 612 persons were confirmed dead due to Covid-19 in the city in April, May and June respectively.

An official said that more than 80% people who lost their lives due to Covid-19 were above 50-years-old with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease among others. 

“Young are equally at risk to contract the infection. But most of them recover faster. However, there have been many reports of healthy and young people showing disease symptoms all of a sudden and developing severe complications . Some such patients die too but they are rare,” said a doctor at one of the Covid-19 hospitals run by the state government.

Dr Rommel Tickoo, associate director, internal medicine at Max Saket said that people suffering from chronic conditions need to take extra care to prevent the infection. 

As per the government data, 584 Covid-19 patients in Delhi require ICU or ventilator support at present. “At present, we have 584 ICU and ventilator beds. Of them, 266 (45%) are vacant,” said an official. He, however, added that if the infection continues to spread the way it is soon we may fall short of critical care beds. Delhi government, in order to make more space for the seriously ill, on Thursday issued a new discharge policy. It stated that patients with mild symptoms can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and no fever for three days. There will be no need for testing prior to discharge, the government said.

In its order, the health department also said moderate cases can be admitted to Covid health centres that have oxygen support facility. Patients on oxygenation whose fever does not resolve within three days and demand for oxygen therapy continues will be discharged only after resolution of clinical symptoms.
