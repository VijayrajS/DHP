VIJAYAWADA: As the tenure of the lockdown completed one month, Vijayawada police have so far booked 1,874 people for violations within the commissionerate limits. According to official police data, the cops earned a record Rs 3.2 crore in fine amounts at a time when vehicle movements have been curtailed.


Police officials said they had intensified the enforcement against the violators since the Day One. As a case-in-point, they cite that the average collection of traffic fines used to stand somewhere in the region of lakhs and, for the first time, the commissionerate has touched over a crore in revenue.

Overall, 985 cases were booked against 1,032 shops and 248 individuals for violating the lockdown guidelines under 188 of IPC (disobeying order promulgated by a government servant).

Apart from shops, 12 big business establishments and 13 hawkers were booked as well for running their operations. While the lockdown has left the roads almost empty, the cops booked 65,947 vehicles across the city for various violations under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, during the last 32 days. Out of the 65,947 vehicles, 677 were booked for violating the lockdown norms.

The cops said that these violations mostly include people travelling in doubles and triples in the same two-wheeler. The cops also seized 6,125 vehicles for travelling without an appropriate reason during the lockdown.

The cops have been conducting checks and booking cases across more than 50 checks posts within their jurisdictions. “Compared to the initial days, the compliance for lock down has significantly improved now than before. This is primarily because of the identification of more red zones in the city which has created fear among the residents,” said a senior police official.

In rest of the Krishna district, over 2,300 cases have been booked so far under Section 188 of the IPC.
