Making a song and dance about coronavirus and going viral too
2020-03-31
HYDERABAD: A song writer’s midnight stroke of creativity has turned out to be a chartbuster that is being used to create awareness against the spread of novel coronavirus in Telangana. The song ‘Chethuleththi mokkutha’ is currently a hot favourite on social media to drive home the message against the virus.


“It is not about me feeling happy because the song is doing well. The only reason behind composing the song was that I felt socially responsible,” songwriter Ram Miriyala told TOI. 

In addition to the popular song, films stars — Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Sai Dharam Tej and Varun — have also come up with a song ‘We got to fight corona edhemaina.’ 

Several others like Balu Kampally Swaero have also come up with songs to create an awareness on the coronavirus and the precautions to be taken. Some are also rephrasing old filmi dialogues, as Maruthi Ram has done, urging caution. Siddhala Hussain came out with a folk song. Manasa Acharya reworked the lyrics of the famous Mohammed Rafi song ‘Sepaayi o sepaayi’ to spread awareness about covid.

But, 32-year-old Ram Miriyala’s song has stolen the march over others. Ram, has also written a few popular songs for his band ‘ChowRaasta,’ including the hugely popular ‘Oerelipotha mama,’ which garnered more than four millions views. In just four days, ‘Chethuleththi mokkutha’ got 2.4 millions views on YouTube. “It is fulfilling to know that the song is serving its purpose. The focus should entirely be on the song and not me,” Ram, who worked for a radio channel until recently, said.
