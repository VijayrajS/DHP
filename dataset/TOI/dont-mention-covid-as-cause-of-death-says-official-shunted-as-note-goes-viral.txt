Don’t mention Covid as cause of death, says official; shunted as note goes viral
2020-05-01
Hours after a confidential note from his office went viral on social media, Debdas Saha , the medical superintendent and vice-principal (MSVP) of Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) in West Bengal, was transferred on Thursday.

The duty roster for MMCH doctors, signed by Saha, circulating on social media caused much embarrassment to the Bengal government. The three-shift duty roster from April 27 to May 17 released on April 25 mentioned in its footnote an advisory to doctors on writing death certificates. “Cause of death will be the usual cause. No mention of Covid in death certificates of Covi positive cases,” Saha said. The state government transferred Saha to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital as professor anaesthesiology department.
