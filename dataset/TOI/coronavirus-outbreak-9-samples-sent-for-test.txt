BENGALURU: Nine new samples of travellers who had gone to China with symptoms of coronavirus were sent for testing at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases on Sunday. 

The results of over 20 samples sent for testing so far from Bengaluru have been negative. "We received nine new cases of suspected patients who came to the institute with influenza-like symptoms. Since they hadn't visited the affected city of Wuhan, we have sent their samples for testing as per protocol," said RGICD director C Nagaraja.
