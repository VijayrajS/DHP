Chennai: The Madras high court on Monday ordered notice to the Centre and the state government on a PIL seeking a detailed report on the availability of Covid-19 testing facilities in the country, including Tamil Nadu, and to ramp up the testing rapidly.

Admitting the plea moved by former President A P J Abdul Kalam's secretary V Ponraj, a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana directed the governments to file their replies in a week.

According to the petitioner, as per the Viral Research & Diagnostic Laboratories Scheme (VRDLs) formulated by the central government in 2013, VRDLs (Viral Research & Diagnostic Laboratories) has to be established throughout the country. "The scheme entails establishment of 10 regional level labs, 30 state level labs and 120 medical college level labs in the state government medical colleges at Rs 646.83 crore," the petitioner said.

The status of this important scheme is totally in dark and if it was properly executed, our country has no need to depend upon China for purchasing kits, he said.
