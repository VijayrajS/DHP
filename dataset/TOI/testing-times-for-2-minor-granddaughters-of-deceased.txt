2020-04-13
Nagpur: Samples of a sixth-month-old girl and her six-year-old cousin, both granddaughters of city’s first Covid-19 victim, were collected again on Sunday for a retest though they had tested negative the first time. Both are currently with their parents who have tested positive and are in isolation ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).On April 12, TOI reported about the six-year-old who is the child of the victim’s daughter. On Sunday, the plight of sixth-month-old also came to fore. The infant is daughter of the 68-year-old deceased’s son. Her father and mother tested positive last week along with four others among the close contacts of the Satranjipura-based victim.The six-year-old’s mother and two siblings had tested positive and shifted to another ward with her uncle and aunt last week itself. The girl was with her father Shahid Khan (name changed) while seven other relatives too were awaiting results at the GMCH isolation ward.On Sunday, Khan’s worst nightmare came true when he tested positive. He was among the first lot of high risk suspects to be isolated at GMCH last Monday. While results of others came soon, Khan’s test result remained pending for unexplained reasons.Khan’s throat swab samples were sent to Mayo hospital lab along with others, as per doctors. Mayo deputy superintendent Sagar Pande had told TOI that as per his records the suspect's sample marked no. 25 were at GMCH on April 7. On Saturday, GMCH declared 31 samples negative and one inconclusive.Khan's sample was collected by Mayo Hospital on April 6, as per GMCH officials.GMCH doctors said the six-year-old would be handed over to a social worker. They refused to comment on the fate of her six-month-old cousin.A similar complex situation had risen in Akola last Thursday. A three-and-half-month old boy tested positive along with his grandmother, father and 5-year-old elder brother. The infant’s mother is negative. The Akola GMCH, having limited space, has not exactly separated the infant and his mother as of now. The suspects and positive patients there have been separated by a partition, as per officials. “The mother only feeds and then returns to the other side of the isolation ward to limit her contact. Rest of the time the infant is with the grandmother and father,” officials said.But, Khan and his brother-in-law are worried what would happen to the two minors of their family. Most of the immediate family members have already tested positive while others are quarantined and yet to be tested. These minors too have to be placed under quarantine for 14 days.
