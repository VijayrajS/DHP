Pune: Tubelights and bulbs at most homes across the city went out a minute before the clock struck 9 on Sunday night. At 9pm sharp, diyas, candles, torches and flashlights were visible at nearly every home in response to the appeal made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

In Deccan area, families stood on balconies or terraces of their homes around a single diya and were heard chanting Vedic mantras. “We could hear some families singing traditional prayer songs and clapping near our house. Some families stood on the terraces looking around while the younger members of the families could be heard screaming restlessly. We also saw firecrackers going off at a distance,” a resident of Bhandarkar Road said. 

Firecrackers were reportedly set off at numerous areas, including Ahmednagar Road, Old Sangvi, Sinhagad Road, Baner and others. 

Along Sinhagad Road, people used torches and mobile phone flashlights while some walked on the roads shouting their support for the government. The atmosphere at Dhayari Phata was like India had won the cricket World Cup, with gatherings on terraces of buildings and rousing chants of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’, a local resident said.

At Pimple Saudagar, a few firecrackers were heard going off while most people used torchlight and mobile flashlights in equal measure with diyas. Chants of ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Go Corona’ filled the silent airspace throughout the nine minutes.

“Most housing societies in Bhusari Colony and Bavdhan had switched off lights. Many residents decorated their balconies with diyas like they do during Diwali. People were even lighting fire crackers while standing their balconies and shouting ‘Go Corona Go’,” said a local resident.

In several areas, the street lights had also been turned off for 9 minutes.

A number of hotels in the city played with lighting to display lit diyas on the facade of their premises.
