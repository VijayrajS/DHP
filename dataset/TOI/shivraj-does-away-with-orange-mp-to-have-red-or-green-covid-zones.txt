CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan does away with orange; Madhya Pradesh to have red or green Covid-19 zones
2020-05-19
BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Covid-19 map will have just two colour codes – red and green – said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday as he unveiled what lockdown 4.0 will look like in the state.


Code orange is out. In his televised address on Doordarshan, the CM didn’t spell out the criteria for the zones but officials later told TOI that orange may have been dropped because there was too much fluctuation between orange and green as new cases cropped up or old ones got cured, and there wasn’t much difference in the relaxations in these two zones.

“Lockdown-04 will be imposed in a different form and manner. We have to save lives along with the world,” he said.

Indore and Ujjain are the only districts tagged red through and through. In Bhopal, Dewas, Dhar, Jabalpur, Khandwa, Mandsaur, Neemuch and Kukchi, only the municipal areas will be come under red-zone restrictions.

The government’s intent, it seems, is to open up industries and businesses as far as possible to revive the economy, while continuing to fight Covid-19.

“All activities, barring those restricted in all zones, are allowed in green areas. All shops, bazaars and vegetable mandis can open, and government and private offices can operate at 100% capacity,” the CM said, adding a cautionary note that a rise in Covid count can quickly push a green zone into red. “Continue to take precautions so that your green zone remains green,” he said.

CM Chouhan said that it is time to explore “possibility in adversity”, rather than give in to the crisis. “I will soon present to people a draft on how Madhya Pradesh can contribute to the making of an Aatmanirbhar (self-sufficient) India as envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.
