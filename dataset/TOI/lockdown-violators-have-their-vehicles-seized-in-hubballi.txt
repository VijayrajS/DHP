HUBBALLI: Police here have started seizing the vehicles of those venturing out without pressing reasons.


Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) P Krishnakant said 144 vehicles, including cars, were seized on Saturday and the drive continued on Sunday. “Police will be compelled to book cases if they find anyone loitering on the streets,” he said.

“It is a clear message to those who roam unnecessarily on the roads and violate the lockdown orders that police would not hesitate to book case against them. People should understand the gravity of the situation. We have to break the chain of novel coronavirus and it can be achieved by remaining indoors and maintaining social distancing,” said Krishnakant.

Despite repeated requests and caning by police, bike-borne people continue to be spotted on the roads in violation of the Covid-10 lockdown. Police have intensified surveillance following reports that people are venturing out even in the evening.

On Sunday, police personnel met senior citizens to learn about their problems and offered help to them. Krishnakant said police would visit to help senior citizens every day.

In the Old Hubballi area, police requested people who thronged the market in the morning to maintain social distancing.
