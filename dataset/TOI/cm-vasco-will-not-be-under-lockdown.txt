Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said that the state government has decided not to issue lockdown orders for Vasco due to the rise in Covid cases at Mangor hill. 

On Thursday Sawant visited Mangor hill to review the situation after a spike in number of Covid cases. Sawant said people from Vasco were demanding for a total lockdown. “Many had asked for total lockdown of Vasco, but after taking review we came to understand that lockdown is not a solution. Conducting 100% tests at Mangor and keeping people in quarantine, or Covid positive people in hospital is the solution. At present there is no need for a lockdown,” he said. Sawant also said that the decision was taken after discussions with epidemiologists and experts. He also said that there were no cases detected outside Mangor hill.

The chief minister said that the government declared the area as a containment zone and even though the transmission was restricted to two wards, the state tested all people in ward numbers 11 and 17. Sawant also said that around 350 families reside in that area and the deputy collector have been instructed to provide essential commodities for the week. “We have provided free of cost, essential commodities to people at Mangor,” he said. 

He also said that state administration has taken control of the Covid pandemic situation and after finding positive cases in a family at Mangor, an increase in Covid-19 cases was noticed. 

He also said that Goa is the only state testing all people entering the state via road, rail, airways and waterways. Sawant said that all corona positive cases have been treated free of cost at government hospitals and there has been a 100% recovery of cases.
