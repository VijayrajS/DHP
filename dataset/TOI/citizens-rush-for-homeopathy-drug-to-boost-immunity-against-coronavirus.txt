“After my doctor prescribed the drug. I came to the shop to buy the medicin,” Deccan resident Chandrakant Bishnoi said. Housing societies are also distributing the medicine among members residents. 

Citizens’ group Divine Jain Group has so far distributed the medicine among 1 lakh people in the city and nearby villages. “Apart from residential societies, we have given the medicine to the police and employees of the Pune and Pimpri Chnchwad civic bodies. We bought the medicine with donation amounts and are working under the charity commissioner’s guidance,” said Sanket Shah of the group. The Karhade Brahmin Sanghatana has distributed close to 1,500 bottles of the drug among policemen. 

Homeopath Apoorva Deshpande said, “Arsenic Album-30 leads to greater absorption of Vitamin C and boosts immunity. But people should consultdoctors before taking it.”

Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, President Avinash Bhondwe said Arsenic Album-30 was not even considered by many homeopathy doctors to treat Covid-19.“There is no study to prove that the drug helps a person prevent getting infected by Covid-19. The AYUSH ministry had stated in a notification that no medicine should be promoted stating it will treat Covid-19.”
