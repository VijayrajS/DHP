2020-03-22
KANYAKUMARI: Day after chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced restricted movement from neighbouring states to Tamil Nadu till March 31 to curb Covid-19 spread, officials from the health department and the Kaliyakkavilai police in Kanyakumari district faced a tough time stopping vehicles from Kerala entering the state through the checkpost on the border at Kaliyakkavilai on Saturday.


On Friday evening, the chief minister in a statement said that only ambulances and vehicles carrying essential commodities like milk, petrol, diesel, vegetables, medicines and gas cylinders, other goods carriers and light motor vehicles with commuters for unavoidable circumstances such as death will be allowed to enter Tamil Nadu. He also said that only limited movement of buses will be permitted.

But, at the Kaliyakkavilai RTO checkpost, almost all vehicles bearing Kerala registration numbers were allowed. “We had a tough time when we asked all the vehicles with Kerala registration to return. They argued that they are working in bordering areas in Kanyakumari and that they should be allowed after a temperature check,” an official said.

Following heated arguments with commuters from Kerala, officials started checking all the TN and Kerala registration vehicles from Kerala and allowed them to enter after checking their temperature. Of the hundreds of vehicles screened, around 10 to 15 were forced to return to Kerala.

Those with fever symptoms were requested to be under home quarantine and allowed to enter Tamil Nadu. Two passengers who had landed at the Thiruvananthapuram airport from abroad on Saturday morning and were heading to their homes in Tamil Nadu were referred to the GH.

Vehicular movement was limited at the Puliyarai checkpost in Tenkasi district and only goods carriers carrying essential commodities were allowed to cross the border.
