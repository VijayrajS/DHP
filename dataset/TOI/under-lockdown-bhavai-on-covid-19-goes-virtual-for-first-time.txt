Under lockdown, Bhavai on Covid-19 goes virtual for first time

Vadodara: They have been performing Bhavai – Gujarati musical folk play – on social issues since years. And when Coronavirus spread in the state, these two artists from the city decided to write and perform Bhavai to educate Gujaratis about the deadly virus and how to keep themselves safe. But they were in a dilemma as they couldn’t move out of their houses due to lockdown.

So Jayanti Chavda and Kshitij Supekar decided to perform their first-ever virtual Bhavai. “We are facing an unprecedented crisis and the virus has affected everyone in the state. Many people are still not taking the pandemic seriously and flouting lockdown rules. So we decided to make a Bhavai on this crisis,” 35-year-old Chavda told TOI. 

“Bhavai has always been a popular form of medium to spread awareness on social issues and also educate people about contemporary world. People learn quickly with entertainment and music,” Chavda, who works in Gujarati films and teaches drama in a school, added. Chavda and Supekar got together a week ago for making Bhavai called ‘Lockdown ma online Bhavai.’

While Chavda wrote the script and dialogues, Supekar helped him in directing the video as they both performed in it in the roles of Vidushak and Ranglo. “We have performed many Bhavais and plays together, but this is for the first time that we acted in front of just camera without any audience. Chavda shot his part in Bhavai at his home, I was filmed at my place and the film was merged,” Supekar, 43, said. 

“It was a bit odd, but a thrilling experience. The Bhavai will be uploaded on YouTube in next few hours and we hope to reach both urban as well as rural audiences. Perhaps, it would change the way Bhavai is performed in future,” Supekar, who began performing on stage in 2002, added.
