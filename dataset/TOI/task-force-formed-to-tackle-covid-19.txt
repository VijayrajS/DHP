Visakhapatnam: The state tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao has said that the government has been taking the measures to tackle coronavirus and added that a task force was formed in the district to address the issue. He said that, so far, only 16 suspected cases had come to light in the district, of which only one case had tested positive.

Srinivas Rao said that the task force created to monitor the situation in the city comprised joint collector Venugopal Reddy, district medical and health officer (DMHO) S Tirupati Rao and city additional SP rank officer Srinivasa Rao.

The minister urged the people not to panic and assured them that the government authorities have already started taking action. He requested the public to take precautions and not join large gatherings. 

“The patient who tested positive for novel coronavirus came from Mecca on March 12. Authorities are now tracking the co-passengers of that person who also travelled in Kachiguda Express. All the people he came in contact with in the past week, including at the clinic in NAD junction and his neighbours, are also being tracked down,” he said.

Srinivas Rao said that 3 km around the patient’s house has been declared as containment zone. “Around 140 teams are on the job to identify the suspected cases in the area. Each team has an ANM, ward volunteer and ASHA worker,” the state tourism minister said and added that the patient’s wife and daughter are also under quarantine. 

He said 850 persons in the district, including 225 in the city, had come from abroad in the last 15 days.
