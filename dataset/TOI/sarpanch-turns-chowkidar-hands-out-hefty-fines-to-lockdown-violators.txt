Hyderabad: A woman sarpanch in Adilabad district is cracking the whip on violators of lockdown. The sarpanch stands near the village chowki, handing out fines to whoever violates the lockdown. 

“We are worried about the rise in number of people affected with the virus. Instead of blaming others, I have decided to take matters into my own hands. Every day, I stand at the common chowki so that I can catch anyone who violates the lockdown,” said Meenakshi Gadge, sarpanch of Mukhra (K) village.

As a result, fines in Mukhra (K), a remote village in Ichoda mandal, are mounting. This week alone, three persons were fined.

In the first case, villager Tulsi Ram was fined Rs 1,000 for travelling in and out of the village five times without reason. In the second instance, a fine of Rs 500 was imposed on Pradeep and in the third, Rs 500 was imposed on Ravikanth for not wearing a mask while stepping out of home. 

The sarpanch, who has studied till class 10, says it is her duty to protect her village. 

Not just her, she is raising awareness among women on the coronavirus pandemic and importance of social distancing and adhering to the lockdown. 

Inspired by her, many women now help her guard the chowki.

Gadge is not the only woman sarpanch taking the lead in the fight against the corona outbreak. The sarpanch of Madanapuram grama panchayat, Vudutha Akhila Yadav (25), too has been guarding the entry point to her village in Nalgonda.

Photos of her holding a stick on the road to the village, to prevent people circumventing the lockdown, went viral recently.
