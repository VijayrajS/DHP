Kolkata: Twenty-one patients were referred to ID Hospital in Beliaghata on Sunday. While 19 of them could be accommodated in the hospital, three others had to be referred to isolation wards in other hospitals. 

This was for the second time that the state nodal hospital for infectious diseases referred the patients to other hospitals. According to the state health department, 52 patients are in hospital isolation now and more than half of them are admitted to ID Hospital.

The state also bolstered the ID Hospital’s frontline medical team by roping in Yogiraj Ray, an infectious diseases expert and an assistant professor at Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. 

The developments coincided with the state’s first three Covid-19 positive patients — two youths, who had returned from the UK, and a girl, who had come back from Scotland, continued to respond well to the treatment. “Their condition is stable and they were given light diet. They did not complain of any complications or discomfort. Their conditions are being monitored closely,” said a senior official. 

Police on Sunday remained on their toes as complaints poured in that several foreign returnees had flouted home isolation norms. Nearly 1,312 people were advised home isolation on Sunday. The complaints about the norms being flouted came from different parts of the city—Dum Dum to Kasba to Tollygunge. Prosenjit Majumdar, a research scholar and a Garia resident, complained that he was being hounded by local club members and neighbours after he returned from the UK despite following all the norms.
