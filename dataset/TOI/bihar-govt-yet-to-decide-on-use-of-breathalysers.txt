PATNA: While Maharashtra police on Tuesday temporarily stopped the use of breathalyser on roads as a precautionary measure against coronavirus, the state government is yet to take a clear decision on its use in Bihar. The equipment detects alcohol when someone blows into it after taking its nozzle inside the mouth.

Same equipment is used on several people for detecting if he or she had consumed alcohol or not. That has a higher probability of coming into direct contact with the pathogen if any infected person had blown into it.

Since there is prohibition on the use of liquor in Bihar, the equipment is also used to arrest those who are found in an inebriated state. Besides, the stern prohibition law has provision of arresting someone just on positive reading of a breathalyser.

When contacted, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar told TOI over phone that no such specific direction, in terms of yes or no, has been issued to officers regarding the use of breathalysers. “But instructions have been issued to respond according to the present situation,” he said. Kumar said the final call on breathalysers would be taken by the transport department.

When asked on the issue, transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala also avoided a reply and said transport secretary would take a call.

When contacted, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the equipment is mainly used by the police department and not by the transport department. “There is IG (prohibition) in police department to take a call on such issues. Besides, excise commissioner is also there,” he said.

However, Agarwal later said he would speak to the excise department secretary on the issue and check the scenario after which he would be able to tell how the matter would be dealt with.
