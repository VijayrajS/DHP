AGRA: The areas that were marked free of coronavirus earlier have now started reporting fresh cases again. At least five city areas have been marked as containment zones again in the last 13 days. These include Tajganj, Khandari, Kamla Nagar and Gandhi Nagar and Dayalbagh 

Presently, there are 67 active Covid-19 containment zones in the district. Of these, 45 are in the city. Health department teams are screening people living in these areas. 

Each containment zone has a perimeter of 250 metres. The district administration has marked areas around the containment zones in the city as buffer zones to curb the spread of infection. The buffer zones range from 750 metres to upto a kilometre. Businesses are not allowed to operate in the buffer zones. The containment areas are completely sealed to ensure no public movement.

Agra chief medical officer (CMO) Dr RC Pandey said, “In the past few days, new cases have surfaced in the inactive containment zones. This mainly happened due to public movement. To check the spread of infection, containment zones are being closely monitored. Buffer zones have been marked around the containment zone. Our teams are screening residents in all the newly-marked containment and buffer zones. Samples of people suffering from fever and breathing difficulties are being sent for lab testing”.
