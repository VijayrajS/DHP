Prayagraj: Being forced to stay indoors because of the lockdown on Mother’s Day might have dashed their plans, but many in the city made up for it by posting emotional messages on social media on Sunday for their mothers.

Social media users shared their emotions via posts, photographs, songs and poems to thank these special women in their lives.

Anjali, a teacher by profession, took to social media and wrote an emotional post for her mother. She was was not able to visit her mother’s native town in Gujrat due to the lockdown. “Social media is a great tool to share feelings for people like us who could not visit their mothers on this special day,” she said.

Another Prayagraj resident Sanjeev said, “My mother lives Lukcnow. I wrote a post for my mother as I couldn’t visit my her because of the lockdown. I could not be there with her, so I talked to her over a video call.”

“Social media is flooded with users wanting to write about what they feel for their mothers,” said Ravi Kesarwani, another local resident.

Salori resident Ajay Tripathi said, “Everyone wants to make their mother feel special on this day. However, for those who cannot, there is always social media.”

“There are a lot of us who do not live with their parents, which makes it difficult for us to meet them often. While it was not possible for me to visit my mother on this day, social media made it possible for me to connect with my mother,” he added.
