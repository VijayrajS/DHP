MUMBAI: A five-member inter-ministerial central team (IMCT), which is in the city to assess the Covid-19 situation, feels Worli Koliwada can become a model for the rest of the country in containing the virus outbreak.


Lauding the State’s efforts to contain the pandemic, the Central team said the doubling rate of patients in the State has increased. While the doubling rate in the state is now 6.3 days, it is 4.3 days in Mumbai.

Besides Kasturba Hospital and the BMC headquarters, the team, headed by additional secretary, Manoj Joshi, visited G-south ward on Tuesday comprising the slum pockets of Worli Koliwada and Jijamata Nagar, which have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots. The G-south ward has recorded the highest number of cases in the city. As on April 17, it had 389 Covid-19 positive cases. After that, the BMC stopped issuing the ward-wise break-up of positive cases. Significantly, tourism minister, Aaditya Thackeray, represents the Worli assembly constituency.

According to a press release issued by the chief minister’s office (CMO), Joshi said Worli Koliwada can be the best example of a coronavirus-free zone in the country and if the work done in the area is replicated in other containment zones, it will help break the virus chain.

Joshi had a prolonged discussion with CM Uddhav Thackeray, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardesi and police commissioner Parambir Singh on the administration’s preparedness to handle the outbreak.

The team’s focus was on implementation of lockdown measures, supply of essential commodities, adherence to social distancing and quality of health infrastructure. The team asked the civic body to ensure adequate supply of oxygen cylinders and ventilators in BMC- and government-run hospitals.
