Two-year jail for violating pandemic norms in Rajasthan
2020-05-03
JAIPUR: Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the state government on Saturday passed an ordinance amending the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act, 1957 by making disobedience of any regulation or obstruction of any officer from discharging his/her duties as a punishable offence with imprisonment of up to two years.

The ordinance, passed by governor Kalraj Mishra, also empowers the state to restrict emergency services -- including banks, media, healthcare and food, electricity, water and fuel supply -- during any pandemic.




Sources in the government told TOI that the amendment will primarily cover the frontline workers, who are subjected to harassment and violence while dealing with epidemics. The amendment goes beyond individual offenders to cover companies and other establishments accused of any violation.

“Every person, who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence (sic),” reads the ordinance. Explaining the company clause of the ordinance, an official said that during the current coronavirus crisis, several firms have violated state directives of social distancing or no-pay cut.

“Now with this ordinance, it will not be easy for them (companies) to get away with such violations,” said the official.

The ordinance also grants powers to the state to take special measures and make special regulations during pandemic situations.

Now the state can prohibit any act, which it considers sufficient to spread or transmit epidemic diseases from person to person. The ordinance will give no legal escape route to an erring party – individual, company or group (social and religious).
