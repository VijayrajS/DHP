2020-04-08
Mangaluru: Six days after the trial run commenced at the newly set up virology research and diagnostic lab at Wenlock Hospital on April 1, Indian Council for Medical Research has given its nod for testing swabs of people suspected to have contracted coronavirus there. At present, swabs are sent to Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS), 171km away, and it takes HIMS at least 48-hours to submit its report.

District minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari tweeted on Tuesday: “With approval of ICMR/NIV today, Covid-19 (confirmatory) tests will be carried out at Wenlock and reports received in a few hours. This will stop dependency on an external district for reports. I thank the central and state governments for responding to our needs.” 

Dr Y Bharath Shetty, Mangaluru City North MLA, also nodal authority to deal with medical hospitals in Dakshina Kannada, stated in a tweet, “Covid-19 lab starts functioning in Mangaluru. Headed by nodal officer Dr Sharath, microbiologist Dr Madhusudahan E, chief technologist Ashok and 3 more technicians.” Dr Shetty had said recently, that certain changes that ICMR had suggested for running the lab has been attended to.

The virology lab has the PCR kits to conduct an average 80-100 Covid-19 tests per day, he said. “The nod for the diagnostic lab by the authorities is a major boost to the efforts of the district administration, that is working overtime to ensure that the process is expedited to containg the spread of the disease, and reports will now be available in hours,” said Dr Shetty.
