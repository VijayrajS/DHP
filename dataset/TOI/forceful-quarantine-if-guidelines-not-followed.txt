Bareilly: After receiving complaints that a few foreign returnees are flouting the government guidelines of 28-day home quarantine, the health department on Monday warned that they will forcefully put such people in quarantine wards of hospitals with the help of police from Tuesday onwards. At present, 77 people who returned from abroad are under observation in Bareilly district.

Additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “We have been receiving complaints that a few foreign returnees who should be in home quarantine are flouting government guidelines by wandering in the city. We will start forcefully putting them in quarantine ward reserved at hospitals from Tuesday if they fail to follow guidelines. We will take assistance of police.” He added they have been receiving nearly two such complaints in a day.

However, if the person shows symptoms of novel coronavirus during incubation period, we admit him or her to isolation ward and collect samples for testing. If people will flout guidelines of home quarantine, we will take action against them.”
