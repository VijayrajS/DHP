Visakhapatnam: Medical staff at various hospitals have stopped reporting for duty fearing coronavirus (Covid-19) infection following the sudden surge in positive cases and six nurses of a government hospital showing symptoms.

Sources said that over 100 staff working in various hospitals across the city have stopped reporting for duty fearing that they may get infected while treating patients.

Around 40 nurses of a city-based private hospital were also absent from work after a few Covid-19 patients were shifted to that hospital, they said. 

“We are not provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and this makes us vulnerable to the virus. Some of us are still working despite such a situation, but not everyone is willing to do so,” said a government hospital nurse on conditions of anonymity.

District collector V Vinaychand has urged the medical staff to not lose hope and keep treating patients. “We will take every precautionary measure to ensure safety,” he said. 

Head of the isolation committee and joint collector Loteti Siva Sankar told TOI they have contacted the medical staff of two private hospitals with isolation wards as well as transit hospitals – Chest Hospital and ENT Hospital. 

“Our officials have been visiting the isolation wards regularly to ensure proper supply of equipment. We are also providing protective equipment, masks, and sanitisers to the medical staff as well as trying to keep them motivated. We have three more private hospitals ready with isolation wards if needed” the joint collector said.
