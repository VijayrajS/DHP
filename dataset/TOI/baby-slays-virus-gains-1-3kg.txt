CHIKKABALLAPUR: A one-year-old girl, who had tested positive for Covid-19 on May 25, has recovered and was discharged from the designated hospital in Chikkaballapur on Thursday. Doctors said treating the underweight baby with multiple problems was a huge challenge but it is to their credit that the child recovered and gained 1.3kg by the time she was discharged.

District surgeon Dr PV Ramesh said the baby suffered from multiple health problems, including dehydration, malnutrition and anaemia. She weighed around 7.4kg at the time of admission as against the normal requirement of around 10kg.

The child and her parents had tested positive after returning from Mumbai.

Given the baby’s health issues, a team of doctors, including pediatricians Dr Prashanth and Dr Gayathri, held a series of meetings with specialists and began treating her. Dr Manjula, dietician, attended to the baby’s general condition, providing her with iron and vitamin supplements.

R Latha, deputy commissioner, Chikkaballapur said the child was provided with various supplements, including nutrients to last for two months at the time of her discharge. The team of doctors would be in constant contact with the parents to oversee the health of the baby, she added.

The child’s parents too have recovered and were discharged along with her.
