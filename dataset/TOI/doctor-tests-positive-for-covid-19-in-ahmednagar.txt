Nashik: A doctor tested positive for Covid-19 in Ahmednagar city on Tuesday, taking the total number of those infected with the contagion to three in the district.

According to district administration officials, the male doctor who tested positive does not have any history of overseas travel unlike the other two patients, who had travelled to Dubai.

“The doctor, who had cold, cough and fever, was admitted to a private hospital. His swab sample was sent to the Pune-based NIV (National Institute of Virology) and the report came today,” said the officials. 

District health department sources said the doctors, nurses and para medical staff who were in close contact with the patient at the private hospital, would be examined by the district health authorities. 

“Since the patient is a doctor, we are also gathering details of the patients he had examined over a period of time. We are also ascertaining if the doctor came in contact with Covid-19 patients,” the sources said. 

Ahmednagar district collector Rahul Dwivedi reiterated the need for people to remain indoors and avoid any kind of gathering. “Take all precautions advocated by central and state governments to prevent yourselves from being infected by the virus.” 

Ahmednagar is among the 75 districts in the country identified by the Centre with Covid 19 positive cases. The Centre had advocated complete lockdown in these districts even before the PM announced a lockdown of the whole nation during his speech late on Tuesday evening. 

The district administration had already closed down all commercial establishments across Ahmednagar district, barring those selling essential items. 

It has also restricted operations of petrol pumps in the district from 5am to 9am and police have been deployed to prevent movement of people on roads, except those in emergency situations.
