Bareilly: As many as 203 people were booked for violating the lockdown and nearly 3,000 vehicles challaned for plying on the roads without any reason in Bareilly district, so far.

Bareilly SSP Shailesh Pandey said the steps were being taken to ensure people’s safety amid corona pandemic, though no Covid positive case has so far been reported from the district.

The SSP said he was monitoring the situation and sought hourly reports from SHOs. He also warned people breaking the lockdown of strict action.

In Bareilly city, nearly 90 people — mostly youths who were roaming on their bikes unnecessarily — were booked. Nearly 11,000 vehicles were inspected by police and the people who came out of their houses due to emergency reasons were allowed to complete their work.

Pandey told TOI, “WHO has declared Covid-19 as a pandemic, and we have seen its effects in other countries. So, it is our prime duty to ensure the safety of people. We are ensuring all emergency services are made available to people, still many people are coming out on the roads for no reasons and compromising with everyone’s safety. I have instructed all SHOs to detain and book such people. So far, 203 people have been booked under IPC section 188 (contempt of the lawful authority of public servants) and nearly 3,000 vehicles were challaned since the lockdown. The detainees were, however, released after furnishing a personal affidavit.”

“Police are always ready to assist people in need of emergency services. They can always approach us without any hesitation. We are sensitising people that we all have to fight the pandemic together. If someone is spreading rumours or indulging in black-marketing, police can be approached,” added the SSP.
