IMA: Give govt hospitals more testing equipment
2020-04-07
Visakhapatnam: Doctors of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Vizag, have pointed out that given the rapidly increasing Covid-19 cases in the district and state, four PCR (polymerase chain reaction) machines which are available with major private diagnostic labs in the city can be put to use for enhanced testing facilities. 

The IMA is seeking permission from ICMR to shift these machines to Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD) and Gitam Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (GIMSR) for more testing per day. The IMA has also asked the government for separate and secured accommodation for doctors directly dealing with Covid-19 patients.

Speaking to TOI, IMA president Dr PA Ramani said, “Vizag should be prepared for more number of positive cases and suspected cases in the coming days. One of the ways to control the spread is testing of public with cough and cold or even mild fever. It is advisable to be ready with more testing centres and kits right away.”

“Currently we have one virology lab at King George Hospita. Apart from it, there are a few private labs which have PCR machines. We have submitted a representation to ICMR to either allow private labs to conduct tests or borrow the machines,” added Dr Ramani.
