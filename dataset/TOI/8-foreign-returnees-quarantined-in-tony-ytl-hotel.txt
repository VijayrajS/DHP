They were stranded in the respective countries due to the lockdown. They reportedly hail from Digras and Pusad tehsils of Yavatmal district. 

They were flown to India by special planes under Central governmentâ€™s Vande Bharat Mission . As soon as they reached Yavatmal, they were medically examined. Since they have no symptoms of coronavirus, their swab samples were not taken.

If they are not found with the Covid-19 symptoms after the completion of the 14-day quarantine period, they would be allowed to leave.
