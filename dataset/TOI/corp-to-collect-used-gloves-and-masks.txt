2020-03-19
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation will tie up with IMAGE (Indian medical association goes eco-friendly) to collect used masks and gloves. Collection bins will be placed at hand wash kiosks which were set up in places like Thampanoor, Palayam, corporation main office, Kazhakkoottam, Pettah and East Fort.


The collection process is being planned in the wake of unscientific disposal of used masks and gloves in large numbers on streets and drains. Separate bins will be used for the collection of masks and gloves.

The civic body will also constitute a 10-member emergency response team comprising health inspectors in all health circles as part of co-ordinating fumigation and disinfection measures. The corporation will purchase thermal scanners, which will be used in public places in the city. The staff have been asked to conduct regular disinfection measures at various places.

On Wednesday, Kerala government nurses association (KGNA) launched a campaign in Medical College Hospital to educate patients and bystanders on proper usage and disposal of masks. The association has been conducting campaigns in major hospitals. KGNA state committee member Priya Krishnan and district secretary Sushama led the classes.
