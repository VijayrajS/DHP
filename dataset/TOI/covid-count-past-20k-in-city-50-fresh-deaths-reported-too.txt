NEW DELHI: The capital’s Covid-19 count crossed the 20,000 mark to reach 20,834 with 990 more persons testing positive for the viral infection on Monday.

While the first 10,000 cases came in 77 days, from March 2 to May 18, data shows that it took only 14 days for the city to reach the next 10,000 — which is reflective of the speed at which the virus is spreading.

Delhi reported its first Covid-19 death on March 13. The number has now gone up to 523. State health authorities on Monday confirmed 50 more deaths caused due to Covid-19. They, however, clarified that only 12 deaths took place on Sunday while the rest of the numbers came from an assessment of case sheets received from hospitals, which included some fatalities that had taken place earlier.

The state has 11,565 active cases at the moment. Of this, government data shows that 2,748 patients are admitted in various Covid hospitals while the rest are at Covid care centre, Covid health centres or under isolation at home. “Only 261 patients, 2% of the active cases, are requiring ICU and ventilator support,” an official said.

AIIMS has 11 patients who are on ventilator support, followed by Sir Ganga Ram City (7), Safdarjung Hospital (6), Apollo Hospital (5), Max Saket (4) and Maa Durga Charitable Trust (3). RML and Fortis Hospitals have two patients each while LNJP and Sir Ganga Ram have one patient each, who are on ventilator support.

Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday held a meeting with senior officers to review the Covid-19 situation in the capital. Sources said that health minister Satyendar Jain also held a review meeting with officers of health department and medical directors of dedicated Delhi government hospitals for Covid-19.

“A revised order has been issued regarding paid quarantine at designated hotels. An order has been issued to add an additional hotel for accommodation of government officers for Covid-19 treatment,” the state health bulletin said.

With an increase in the number of cases, the number of calls received for CATS ambulance and general queries related to Covid-19 on the government helpline has also gone up. On April 30, for example, CATS control room received 68 calls while 891 calls were received on the helpline. Monday’s (June 1) data shows that 343 calls were received by CATS, while the corresponding figures for calls made on the helpline has gone up to 1,375.
