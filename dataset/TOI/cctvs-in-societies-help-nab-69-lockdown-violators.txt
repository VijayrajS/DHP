VADODARA: If you are hanging out in the common area of your apartment or going out for morning walks near your colony, then be prepared to face action. Police have have now begun scanning CCTV footages of the residential colonies and apartments in different areas to track down people who are flouting lockdown rules. 


“We have been getting lot of complaints against those who are going out for morning walks or hang out in the garden of the apartments. So we are now checking CCTV footages of residential colonies and apartments,” said Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner. 

On Friday, police checked CCTV footages of 44 colonies and apartments and registered FIRs. 

Sixty-nine persons were booked and arrested for flouting the lockdown rules. “Our teams are already monitoring the CCTVs installed on roads. Nobody who breaks the rules will be spared,” Gahlaut told TOI. 

Police said that over 1,000 persons have called up police control room since the lockdown was enforced. Over 60% of these calls were about people hanging out at roadside stalls and grocery shops in groups while about 150 calls were about people playing cricket in the colonies. Most of the calls are made by neighbours who are worried that they may get infected. 

“Our teams keep visiting many residential colonies but people flee from the spot when they see a police vehicle. So, our teams now walk for a distance and catch hold of those who are out on the roads without any valid reason,” Gahlaut added.
