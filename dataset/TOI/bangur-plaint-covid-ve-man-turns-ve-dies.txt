Kolkata: A 68-year-old Amherst Street resident, who had been declared Covid-negative and discharged from MR Bangur Hospital, was admitted to the hospital just 12 hours later and found to be suffering from Covid-19, his son said. The man, Om Prakash Gupta, died in the hospital. The family has urged the health department to probe the matter.

An MRBH official said, “Tests are not conducted in the hospital. We have to depend on the health department. Gupta had been released since we were told that he had tested negative. We were then asked to re-admit him. He died later.” Calls, text and WhatsApp messages to director health services and MRBH superintendent were not answered. 

According to the kin, Gupta was admitted to MRBH on April 22 after he complained of fever, cold and sore throat. On April 25, his son got a call from health department saying Gupta was Covid positive and the family should stay in home quarantine. “We got a call from the hospital on the evening the next day saying that my father was Covid negative. We brought him home on April 26,” said son Rajyabardhan Gupta. “On Monday afternoon we got a call from Swasthya Bhawan saying that my father was positive and that an ambulance was being sent to take him back to hospital,” said Rajyabardhan. On Tuesday morning, Gupta passed away.
