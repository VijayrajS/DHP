BHOPAL: BJP leaders across the state rang bells, clanged cymbals, blew conch shells and clapped hands at their residence at 5pm as part of social distancing to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus as Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested.

Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan observed ‘janata curfew’ and clanged cymbals to send a message of appreciation towards all working professionals — nurses, doctors, cleaners, transport workers, police personnel, journalists and others — who have been helping battle the contagion.

“We should be vigilant and thankful to all those who have been helping us to fight the corona spread. We are sending a message as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Chouhan.

Chouhan, who is also learnt to have spoken to Prime Minister Modi said, “Discussed in detail about the corona spread. The Prime Minister is keeping a vigil on the situation in Madhya Pradesh. He has approved Rs350 crore budget for virus control in the state, which would be utilised by the collectors against fighting the coronavirus spread. I am thankful to him,” he said.

State BJP president V D Sharma, who passed his day doing yoga while observing ‘janata curfew’, blew conch shell as the clock struck 5pm. He also appealed to Governor Lalji Tandon and the acting chief minister Kamal Nath for strict vigil to control coronavirus and said that BJP will extend all possible support and cooperation.

BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra shared a video clip on social media blowing a conch shell, while the former minister Sanjay Pathak shared a video with his family members ringing bells and clanging ‘thalis’ in appreciation towards the corona warriors.

A video shared by former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia showed him clapping with his family members at his Delhi residence. Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar also posted a video with his wife blowing a conch shell.
