Lockdown takes sheen off migrant zari workers’ lives in Hyderabad
2020-05-14
HYDERABAD: It was after two days that 22-year-old Sheik Ashraful finally had a meal on Tuesday when some friends whipped up a hot plate of dal and rice. They say the young man was surviving only on water and some biscuits when they reached his crammed room in Syed Nagar, nestled within the upscale MLA Colony of Banjara Hills.


Sadly, this is the fate of at least a 1,000 zari workers — all of them from Bengal — living in this urban slum. With boutiques in the city closed indefinitely, they have been rendered jobless and penniless. “Since the lockdown started, we have not got any payments. We have been surviving on the help that some kind-hearted individuals or NGOs have been extending to us,” said Hasem Ali, from Uluberia in Bengal’s Howrah district. Most of them are the only earning members of their family.

“I haven’t been able to send any money home for two months now. Even my family is struggling for two square meals,” chipped in Wasim Akram while pointing to a pile of fabric that he hasn’t been paid for embellishing. The empty pockets, he added, are taking a bigger toll on them since landlords have been hounding them for payment. “He has been calling every other day asking us to pay. Where will we get the money,” asked Sheik Imraj. These rooms, with 10 occupants, cost them around Rs 8,000 a month.

Frustrated and emotionally drained, all these workers only want one thing now: to return to the comfort of their loved ones. “But even that is not happening. We have registered with the authorities for the train service but haven’t heard anything from them so far,” said Mosin Gazi..“We have been trying to help them with ration and other essentials. Their situation is quite bad considering their employers have washed their hands off them,” said Partha Pratim Mallik, member of Sporsho, a group that’s involved in relief work.
