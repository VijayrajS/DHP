Hubballi: Five journalists from Hubballi have decided to home-quarantine themselves after they covered an event attended by P-363, a watchman of the Toravi Hakkal graveyard.

The authorities said the five journalists — two each from electronic and print and one from digital media — covered Shab-e-Barat at the graveyard on April 9. Though they have not shown any symptoms of the infection, the journalists decided to self-quarantine. They are doing fine, said the district administration. Doctors at KIMS have collected their samples and the test reports are expected by Tuesday evening.

Fourth positive case in Gadag

Gadag district on Monday reported the fourth Covid-19 case with a 24-year-old man (P-396) from Ranganwadi area being infected. The previous three cases were also reported in the same area.

The district administration has already announced Ranganwadi area as containment area. Essential materials are being supplied at the doorstep of residents as none of them is allowed to step out. Police have heightened vigil, and all entry and exit points have been sealed.

The authorities said P-396 is the secondary contact of P-370 and a neighbour. The chain of infection started from P-166 who died at Gadag Institute of Medical Sciences on April 9. The family of P-396 has eight members and all their swab samples have been sent testing. Efforts are on to trace the secondary contacts of P-396.
