Get more Vitamin D during lockdown, suggest experts
2020-04-23
Visakhapatnam: With people staying indoors due to the lockdown and not exposed to adequate sunlight, doctors and nutritionists have pointed to the risk of Vitamin D deficiency, which in turn leads to calcium deficiency. 

Vitamin D3 is a hormone produced in the skin on exposure to sunlight while Vitamin D balances the body’s immunity and plays a role in lowering depression. Health experts suggest taking Vitamin D and Vitamin D3 supplements to avoid deficiency.

Nutrition consultant and guest faculty at the Andhra University yoga department R Rekha said, “Vitamin D helps in keeping the immune system healthy and balanced. If there is too much stimulation, autoimmune diseases can set in. In case of inadequate immune system activity, infections can occur. Around a decade ago, the National Institute of Health, USA, had warned that low Vitamin D levels are associated with frequent colds and influenza. Research shows that Vitamin D might play an important role in regulating mood and lowering depression.”

“To make up for the non-exposure to sunlight, one can consume Vitamin D3 in its active form like sesame or gingelly seed as powder or as a sweet or by consuming sesame oil or sesame milk,” Rekha advised.

Medical experts say that Vitamin D deficiency has a proven link in escalating incidences of cardiac ailments and heart attacks. It also lowers the efficacy of cholesterol medicines. Absorption of calcium from the intestine to the bones is also hampered. “The deficiency is associated with joint ache, body pain, muscle pains, cramps, fractures, early onset of osteomalacia or softening of bones, chronic fatigue and laziness,” said Dr Ladi Loknadh, professor of orthopaedics at KGH.
