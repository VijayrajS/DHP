Mantri’s house notified as ‘quarantined’
2020-04-08
Malda: The North Dinajpur district administration on Tuesday managed to notify the Raiganj house of Union minister of state Debasree Chaudhuri as home quarantined after twice failing to do so earlier.

Chaudhuri, who is the Raiganj MP, had on Saturday refused to be labelled as such. A group of health workers and, later, the block medical officer of health along with a police team were spurned by her in their attempts to put up the notice on her house wall. She had returned to Kolkata from Delhi on March 23 and reached Raiganj on March 31. On April 2, she took to streets to distribute masks among people. Complaints were lodged against her. 

Though earlier Chaudhuri had claimed a “politically motivated” plot to “defame” her, on Tuesday she said: “I don’t want to comment on this issue”. She had said on Saturday that the notice would create panic among her neighbours. The notice urged people not to visit Chaudhuri’s house during quarantine period from March 31 to April 13.
