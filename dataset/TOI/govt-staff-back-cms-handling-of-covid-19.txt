VISAKHAPATNAM: The Covid-19 crisis has ensured that all government employees do their bit in battling it. 

Speaking to TOI, K R Suryanarayana, president of AP State Government Employees’ Association said the government employees are willing to give their hundred per cent in this hour of need. “Almost 70% of the employees are working either online or on field, if need be, all employees will come forward to work to put an end to this growing menace.”

Clarifying on the issue of their grievances, Suryanarayana said, “We have issues concerning payment of dues and salaries, which need to be addressed. However, with the corona crisis playing out, our priorities have changed and right now we are all focused on dealing with it. This is what all employees are focused on.” Suryanarayana made it clear that all issues have now taken a back seat and added that if need be the lock-down must be extended to the maximum extent so that the crisis can be resolved.

Speaking on future course of action, he said, “Let us pray and hope for the best, nobody should lose confidence. We have drawn up a plan to consolidate all employees’ unions and form a united front. But all this will take time as every state government will take time to recover economically.”

Suryanarayana said that even in terms of equipment and gear, priority was being given to states such as AP.
