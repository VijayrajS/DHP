2020-04-24
PUNE: Police in the city and Pimpri Chinchwad are focusing much on the health of their officers and personnel with three men in uniform so far testing positive for Covid-19.


The Pimpri Chinchwad police have decided to conduct medical tests of their officers and personnel suffering from cough and cold. On the other hand, the Pune police have provided their staffers deployed at various checkpoints with vibration plate machines to stay fit. 

The Pimpri Chinchwad police have tied up with a private hospital at Thergaon where the tests will be conducted by the doctors. The police commissionerate will bear the cost of the tests.

Assistant commissioner of police Pimpri Chinchwad Shridhar Jadhav said, “The focus is on the safety of the entire police team. Keeping this in mind, police commissioner Sandeep Bishnoi has decided to conduct the medical tests on any staffer found suffering from cough and cold. If suggested by the doctors, the Covid-19 test of the police personnel will also be conducted” 

The Pimpri Chinchwad police have also distributed safety kits to the 3,000 police personnel. Each kit comprises face shield, masks, gloves, goggles, sanitizer, vitamin C and zinc tablets.

Personnel of the Pune police deployed at various checkpoints have to stand on the vibration plate machines for 10 minutes a day to remain stress free. “The vibrations stimulate the muscles and improve blood circulation, which ultimately result in relief from stress and joint and back pain,” a senior officer said.

“We have provided two machines each at the five zones. One policeman has been deployed to carry the machine to the check points under three police stations daily,” the officer said.

Constable Dasharath Sonawane, who used the machine, said, “I felt fresh as the machine relieved the physical and mental stress.”
