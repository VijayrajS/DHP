MADURAI: An eight-bed isolation ward for patients infected by coronavirus was inaugurated at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on Wednesday.

Dean of the hospital, Dr J Sangumani, inaugurated the facility at ward number 120 by lighting the traditional lamp and cutting a ribbon. Sangumani said that a team of nine doctors deputed at the ward would work on a rotational basis. The doctors would be given N95 masks and other protective gear. The ward has been prepared to prevent the spread of the disease if any positive case is reported. The number of beds in the ward would be increased if the need arises, he added.

The dean said the disease could be treated if detected early and given proper medical attention. He said there was adequate stock of medicines in the hospital to treat the disease. Washing hands regularly is one way in which the disease could be prevented, he said.

Doctors at the hospital said that the symptoms of the disease included fever, cough, breathlessness, throat pain, body pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. People with these symptoms should visit the hospital for a check-up immediately, they added.
