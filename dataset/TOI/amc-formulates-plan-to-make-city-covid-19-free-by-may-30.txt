Aurangabad: With the number of confirmed Covid-19 positive cases increasing from 53 to 273 over the week, the civic administration has come up with a multi-pronged strategy under its administrator with the aim to eliminate the infection from the city by May 30. Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey presided over a meeting on Sunday to discuss the implementation of the modified Covid-19 control and management strategy. City engineer Sakharam Panzade, municipal officer of health Nita Padalkar, head of task force and legal advisor Aparna Thete and all medical officers and staff nurses were in attendance. In the meeting, it was decided that as against the previous strategy of putting the high-risk and low-risk contacts of the positive cases in Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) quarantine facilities, the throat swab samples of the suspects will be collected from their respective residences. The decision comes in the wake of the allegations made by both suspected and positive Covid-19 patients about poor transportation and accommodation arrangements for the suspected cases. Patients who test positive for Covid-19 will be shifted to the Covid care centres (CCCs) set up at the Social Welfare Hostel at Qile Ark, MGM sports complex, MIT hostel and Emergency Operations Centre at Padampura. The civic body has arranged for the admission and treatment of more than 2,000 asymptomatic patients at its CCCs. “Two medical officers of AMC will supervise the CCCs in 12-hour shifts,” said Pandey. Some hostels in Bamu have also been reserved for use as quarantine facilities.
