HYDERABAD: Health authorities in the state are using the records with pharmacies of people buying drugs for fever and cold to test them for Covid-19.


The state authorities had earlier directed pharmacies and pharmaceutical associations to note down the name, address and contact details of those who buy drugs for fever and flu as many people with symptoms of coronavirus were not getting tested.

“We have taken the records of those people from shops, tracked them and tested their samples. Around 100 people were tested through this process. Their results are awaited,” said a district medical authority, adding that these people had not revealed they weresuffering from fever during the door-to-door survey. 

On the other hand, a few pharmacies have said that they have not received any directions from the authorities. “This was reported in media but we did not get any directives,” a private medical shop owner said on conditions of anonymity. He said that while some Whatsapp groups were created for this purpose, not all the shops were included. 

There are around 4,800 medical shops in Hyderabad. Dolo 650, Paracetamol etc are available over the counter. According to sources, purchase of such medicines is rampant in Secunderabad and SR Nagar.
