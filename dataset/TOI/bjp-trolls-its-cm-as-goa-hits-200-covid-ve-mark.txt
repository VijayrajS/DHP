BJP trolls its CM as Goa hits 200 Covid positive-mark
2020-06-07
PANAJI: Within minutes of the state crossing the 200-mark of Covid-19 positive cases, it was BJP spokesman Dattaprasad Naik who took a potshot at his own government by posting a comment on social media tagging chief minister Pramod Sawant, his party state president Sadanand Tanavade and others: “Double century. Who takes the credit now?”

Naik’s post comes at a time when Sawant has been facing all-round criticism from opposition to the public for a series of missteps.


‘CM alone should not be blamed’
One of these was allowing a woman coming from Mumbai to skip the screening test at the border, who was later tested positive.

Naik also questioned Sawant and his party president over the diversion of construction workers’ funds to sarpanchs and said BJP in Goa never had to face any allegations of scam since 2012.

TOI had front-paged the report where Sawant admitted to lapses and said four sarpanchs had availed funds meant for labourers.

Taking a dig at Sawant and tagging home minister Amit Shah and national organising secretary B L Santosh, Naik said it was the first time since Manohar Parrikar was sworn in as the chief minister in 2012 that BJP had to face allegations of a scam.

“All concerned officers involved in this scheme must be immediately suspended,” he tweeted and followed it up by saying, “all involved from top to bottom must be punished”.

But later speaking to TOI, Naik tried to tone down his rhetoric and said the chief minister alone shouldn’t be blamed, as he was trying his best. “The rest 39 MLAs should also be held responsible,” he said.

Naik, who lost twice to labour minister Jennifer Monserrate from Taleigao constituency, said she should be held responsible for the diversion of construction workers funds.
