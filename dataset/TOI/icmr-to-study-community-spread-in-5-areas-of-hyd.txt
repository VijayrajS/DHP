2020-05-29
HYDERABAD: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will conduct serosurveillance in five areas of Greater Hyderabad to find if there is any community transmission of Covid-19.

Hyderabad is among the 14 hotspot metro cities selected for the sampling to monitor the pattern of Covid-19 transmission and help generate evidence on the role of asymptomatic and mild infections in transmission. Adibatla, Chandanagar, Miyapur, Balapur and Tappachabutra are the areas from where samples from random people will be collected.

A total of 500 samples will be selected. From each family, one person will be selected. Samples from people only above 18 years of age will be collected. “Within the family also, there will be a separate code for selecting the sample. Serum from blood samples will be separated at a medical facility,” the official said.

The serum samples will be sent to National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai, for testing presence of Covid-19 antibodies. The institute will use ELISA test kit developed by National Institute of Virology, Pune. “If there are antibodies, it means there is community spread and immunity being built among the people,” officials said.
