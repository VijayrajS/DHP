LUCKNOW: With the coronavirus scare peaking in the country and district health officials claiming government hospitals are prepared with isolation wards to fight the virus, TOI on Wednesday conducted a reality check of three prominent hospitals in Lucknow.

At King Georgeâ€™s Medical University, health care workers kept sending this reporter from one department building to another with no information or signage on where the isolation ward has been set up. At RML Institute of Medical Sciences, the fivebedded isolation ward could hardly pass any guidelines set for one. When this reporter went to KGMU amid scores of patients, there was no signage or information on the campus for those with flu symptoms.

In search of the isolation ward, the reporter was sent to Gandhi ward from the OPD help desk. Thereafter,to the public relations officer. With no isolation ward yet in sight, the reporter then went to the microbiology department where he was informed that the ward has been set up in the department of infectious diseases. While directions to the ward were missing, the isolation ward at KGMU adhered to guidelines. Authorities, however, need to draw up a plan so that a suspected patient does not wander about amid patients.

At Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), a small room with five beds in the trauma centre is being converted into the isolation ward. Till Wednesday, orthopedic patients had been admitted here. According to the guidelines issued by US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, a coronavirus isolation room should be a single patient room from where air circulated should be exhausted outside or through an efficient filtering system.

At RMLIMS, however, the five beds were close to one another as is with general wards. There were two exhaust windows.
