PUNE: Six more travellers were quarantined at the PMC’s Naidu hospital on Friday after they complained of minor illness. Of these three were discharged after testing negative of the contagion.


The 10 individuals isolated at the facility on Thursday have also tested negative for the contagion.

“The six travellers complained of cold, cough, fever and headache, after which they were quarantined. Their throat swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology for testing. Reports of the three travellers were negative, hence, they were discharged the same day. We will get reports of other three travellers on Saturday,” Sajeev Wavare, assistant medical officer of health of the PMC, said.
