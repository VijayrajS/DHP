GANDHINAGAR: Attempting to allay fear and panic among people over the coronavirus scare, the state government on Tuesday said that there is no need for people to fear, but advised citizens to stay informed and alert about the virus.


Based on the data shared by the government of India, eight persons who travelled from China to India recently – four from Ahmedabad, two from Vadodara and one each from Anand and Junagadh – have been screened. They will be kept under observation for the next 28 days although none have shown any symptoms of coronavirus.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health & family welfare, while addressing media persons said, “Not a single case of coronavirus has been registered in Gujarat or any part of India, so there is no need to panic. The state government is taking all necessary preventive actions and citizens need to stay alert and take precautions.” She said civil hospital Ahmedabad has been nominated as the base hospital and the CM, deputy CM and the chief secretary have reviewed the situation.

Ravi said that all the persons who arrived from China are healthy and show no symptoms of coronavirus. “All have been screened and their health will be tracked for the next 28 days as a precautionary measure. If required, they will be shifted to isolation wards,” Ravi said.

Self-reporting kiosks have been installed at the Ahmedabad and 12 other airports in the state, where passengers arriving from China or elsewhere can report on their health status. All districts have been asked to set up facilities where people can seek assistance. “A medical team will be placed round the clock at the Ahmedabad international airport along with an ambulance. Besides, we have kept an ample stock of PPE kit, N95 mask, triple layer mask and other required materials,” Ravi said.
