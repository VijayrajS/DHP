2020-03-14
PUNE: Single- and multi-screen theatres across the city are fearing huge losses with the state government on Friday ordering closure of such facilities till March 30 following the spread of Covid-19. 


The government ordered closure of cinema theatres, gymnasiums, swimming pools and public parks in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur with effect from Friday midnight with the number of confirmed coronavirus patients in the state going up to 17. 

“The closure will badly affect the business of cinema and films. Expenses will remain the same and have a cascading effect on the allied aspects of the business, such as vendors, suppliers, food and beverage, tax collection and manpower,” said Neerav Panchamia, chief operating executive of the ESquare Group of Hotels and Multiplexes. 

Pune district has nine single-screen theatres and over 20 multiplexes. “The closure will affect all the films slated for release in April and May. It will take at least six months for us to recover the losses,” Panchamia said. 

Poona Exhibitors Association member Sadanand Mohol said, “February and March have been sluggish for us because of the board (standards X and XII) examinations. The footfall has reduced further because of coronavirus. The state’s order will affect producers, cinema halls and all allied businesses.”

Gym owners have also expressed concerns over the ongoing situation. “Those who rely on gyms for a livelihood will have a tough time. We will tell our members to walk a lot, practise ‘suryanamaskar’ and ‘pranayama’ and do floor exercises as long as the gyms remain closed,” said Tejashree Ray, who owns a fitness centre.
