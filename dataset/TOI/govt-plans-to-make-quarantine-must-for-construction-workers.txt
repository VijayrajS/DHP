UP government plans to make quarantine must for construction workers
2020-04-20
LUCKNOW: UP government is planning to adopt stringent measures, including making 14-day quarantine mandatory for the workforce which will be engaged in construction-related activities, as it gears up to revive the state economy hit by lockdown.

According to sources, the state government is planning to put in place a slew of measures to arrest the spread of contagious virus before kick-starting economic activities from Monday.

“A large number of labourers are expected to reach cities and villages after April 20 when economic and construction activities, including those related to industries and agriculture, will be revived,” a senior government official said. A host of migrant workers got stuck at various points after factories closed operations due to lockdown. Left without work, they were forced to return to their homes.

Principal secretary, rural development, Manoj Kumar Singh told TOI, “Things will be clear after April 20 when the department will be able to assess the actual strength of workforce.”

The department has already announced that job cards would be provided to migrants under Centre’s flagship Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for construction works in rural areas.

“Most migrants have undergone a 14-day quarantine period ever since lockdown was announced on March 25 but still we cannot take any chance. We will ensure that workers deployed under MNREGS have undergone quarantine to prevent spread of coronavirus infection. We will also ensure social distancing and use of masks by workers,” he said. Activities related to mining and transportation of minerals will also start from April 20. Secretary, mining, Roshan Jacob said the department would deploy minimum possible labourers while relying more on machines for mining.
