2020-04-16
SALIGAO: After receiving approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research, a ‘rapid testing’ facility for Covid-19 has commenced at the North Goa district hospital at Mapusa. 


This is expected to enhance the testing capacity of the health department.

Two machines have been installed at the hospital, while testing of samples began from Monday. 

Medical superintendent Dr Mohandas Pednekar said a special laboratory was set up at the hospital premises for which a ‘biological safety cabinet’ was procured. 

He also said that the device was validated by a team under senior pathologist Dr Varsha Munj, who along with laboratory technicians and two microbiologists will conduct tests. 

“At a time, four samples can be taken up for testing, and around 80 samples are expected to be tested on a daily basis,” said Pednekar. 

However, in case a sample tests positive, a confirmatory test needs to be conducted at Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), Bambolim.

It may be recalled that on April 6, health minister Vishwajit Rane had announced that the state government would collaborate with a Goa-based company and five PCR systems would be procured and installed at GMC, sub-district hospital at Ponda and North Goa district hospital, Mapusa.
