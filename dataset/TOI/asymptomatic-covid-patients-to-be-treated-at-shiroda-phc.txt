Asymptomatic Covid patients to be treated at Shiroda PHC
2020-06-08
Margao: The state government on Tuesday took over the primary health centre at Shiroda, and designated it as a Covid care centre. South Goa district collector Ajit Roy, who issued a notification to that effect, said only asymptomatic Covid positive patients will be housed there. 

Roy has also issued an order under provisions of the Disaster Management Act requisitioning the services of the entire premises of the Gomantak Ayurved Mahavidyalaya, Shiroda, and notified it as a Covid care centre to house asymptomatic patients. “That’s a back-up hospital, in case numbers of positive cases spike,” he said. The OPD and emergency of the PHC has been shifted to the Ayurveda hospital. The combined strength of the two hospitals designated as Covid care centres is nearly 160. 

Deputy director, health services, Dr Ira Almeida, who was overseeing the arrangements at the PHC Shiroda until late evening said that space has been made to accommodate 60 beds in the hospital. “All arrangements are in place. Since today will be sort of a test run of the Covid care centre, not more five patients will be admitted tonight. From tomorrow, all asymptomatic positive patients will be admitted to the Covid care centre at Shiroda,” Almeida said,. 

“We have a specialist team looking after patients at the ESI Covid hospital. We required their expertise more for our symptomatic patients. We now see that we should be prepared for the possible increase in patients,” said secretary for health Nila Mohanan.

Ten Shiroda locals were arrested by Ponda police for opposing the government’s decision to use the PHC as a facility for Covid-infected people. Police resorted to a lathi charge to disburse the mob. They arrested Shavik Naik, 21, Jose Fernandes, 49, Anacleto Agustinho, 31, Shivanand Naik, 53, Peter Cruz, 35, Camilo Fernandes, 40, Mayur Parkar, 23, Agnelo Cruz, 42 and two others.
