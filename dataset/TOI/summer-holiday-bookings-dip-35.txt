VADODARA: Rajiv Patel, a city-based art connoisseur, was all set to leave for the US and spend some time with his friends this summers. 

But the COVID-19 (coronovirus) scare compelled him to change his plans. “I have postponed my tour due to the travel advisory and may visit Los Angeles later this year,” Patel said. 

Patel isn’t the only one whose holiday plan was sabotaged, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. According to estimates by tour operators, at least 35% of bookings to destinations in the far eastern countries have already been cancelled, after the news about widespread outbreak of coronavirus infections appeared.

“At least 35% of the ticket bookings for holidays in the far east for travel scheduled in April, have already been cancelled. On the other hand, some are still in wait and watch mode and waiting for a revised notification from these countries about the epidemic situation,” said Anuj Pathak, secretary, Tour Operators and Travel Agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG).

“Even routes such as Dubai, and by extension UAE, have also got affected,” he added. A travel agent from the city said that his business too got severely affected as an auto show in Berlin got cancelled due to Coronavirus and it led to cancellation of travelling plans of many Barodians.

“I had made travel plans to Europe in May to escape the summer heat here. But the COVID-19 outbreak has put break on my plans. I may now consider some other destination,” said Ananda Joshi, an HR professional. 

“Several inquiries are now about destinations such as Almaty, Prague, Vienna, and Budapest, among others in eastern Europe including Russia due to cheaper airfare and hotels. This season, we have cancelled about 35 per cent of overall bookings,” said Manish Sharma, secretary of TAFI’s Gujarat chapter.
