DST to fund IIT-K for making reusable N95, N99 masks
2020-05-05
Kanpur: Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India, under its Nano Mission, has approved funding to IIT-Kanpur for development of new, advanced, affordable and reusable N95 and N99 masks which will strengthen India’s fight to check the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

An IIT-Kanpur startup, E-Spin Nanotech, founded by the institute’s alumnus Sandip Patil in association with Prof Sri Siva Kumar of department of chemical engineering and professors Thiruvancheril G. Gopakumar and Raja Angamuthu of the department of chemistry are working on the production of advanced antiviral and antibacterial affordable reusable masks.

"The Centre for Nanosciences is working on development of reusable N-95 and N-99 masks. The mask, which has anti-viral and anti-bacterial property, will also give very good comfort in breathing. The product is being developed using electro-spun nanofibres. With multiple layers, it will filter the particles anything more than 100 nanometre besides giving good breathing comfort. The project, supported by DST Nano Mission, will help us to get commercialised", said Prof Siva Kumar.

Sandip Patil while talking about development of reusable N-95 and N-99 masks said, "We have a patented technology to produce a nano-fibre with a capacity of one thousand metre to 10,000 metre per day. We are going to use the same technology to produce anti-viral and anti-bacterial face masks with reusuable characteristic of the order of 50,000 to one lakh masks per day."

Dr Siva Kumar also informed that this is a collaborative project between the chemistry and chemical engineering department of f IIT-K
