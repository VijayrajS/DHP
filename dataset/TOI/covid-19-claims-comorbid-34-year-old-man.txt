TUTICORIN: A 34-year-old Covid-19 positive man, who was under intensive care at the Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital succumbed to the disease in the early hours of Friday. 

Tuticorin collector Sandeep Nanduri told TOI that the man, who had returned from Chennai, was suffering from Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) – a serious neurological disorder – due to which saving him became impossible.

“He worked in a prawn company in Tuticorin and was stranded in Chennai. He travelled illegally in a truck to Tuticorin without obtaining the pass on May 12,” the collector said.

The man was initially admitted to a private hospital and then at the government hospital after his condition worsened. “His body was disinfected, wrapped in a plastic cover and the burial was done as per standard protocol,” Nanduri said.

Tuticorin Corporation sanitary workers equipped with PPE handled the body and buried it in a 15-feet-deep pit in Chidambara Nagar. Samples were collected from 50 people including the doctors and staff of the private hospital and from a few of his relatives.

“Results of 40 samples are negative including doctors and staff of the private hospital. They have been kept under quarantine. The ward he was admitted is closed for disinfection,” the collector added. 

A senior neurologist said GBS is a very rare autoimmune disorder in which the antigen antibody cross reaction damages the nerve cells. It could result in weakening limbs, breathing difficulty and even variations in the heart beat.

This is the second Covid-19 death in Tuticorin district after the death of a 72-year-old woman with respiratory illness on April 10.
