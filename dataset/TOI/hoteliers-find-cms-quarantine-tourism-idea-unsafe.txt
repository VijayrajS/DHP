Hoteliers find Himachal Pradesh CM’s quarantine tourism idea ‘unsafe’
2020-06-07
SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s proposal to develop Himachal Pradesh as a “quarantine tourism” destination has met with opposition from a section of hoteliers. They said going ahead with the proposal at this stage will put hotel employees, properties and most importantly, residents in towns and villages at risk.

Shimla Hotel and Restaurant Association president Sanjay Sood said to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the state’s borders were closed for the tourists, which resulted in huge losses for the sector in the peak tourist season. 

“We should not open our borders for any kind of tourism now, leave aside quarantine tourism, as we know that cases are going to increase manifold in June and July,” he said.

Since cases are on the rise in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Punjab etc, the state government should not consider opening hotels till at least end of August or September.

Sood said instead of promoting Himachal as a quarantine tourism destination now, the government should aim to give a boost to tourism in later in the year by marketing the state’s potential for wellness tourism, adventure tourism, environmental tourism, cultural tourism, heath tourism, religious tourism and culinary tourism.

He suggested that the government should join hands with the state’s hotel associations to conduct road shows, exhibitions, dinners with popular travel houses in all metros and cities of India to showcase Himachal Pradesh as a safe destination for all to visit and enjoy the beauty of the hill state.
