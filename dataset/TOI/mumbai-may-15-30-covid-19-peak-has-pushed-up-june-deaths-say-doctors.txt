2020-06-14
MUMBAI: June’s first fortnight has been the cruellest period in the state, with Covid-19 claiming 1,544 lives. In contrast, the entire month of May saw 1,827 deaths.


The city registered 1,380 cases on Saturday, which has been in tune with the daily tally throughout June so far, taking the overall count to 56,831 cases.

 

Both the state and BMC updates revealed that more men than women died on Saturday. The state toll of 113 deaths included 73 males and 40 females while the city toll had 22 females and 47 males.

Most of the deaths were among the 60-plus age group—accounting for 65 out of 113 deaths in the state and 37 in the city’s daily toll of 69.

Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state task force on Covid, said the June deaths were a reflection of the fact that the city witnessed its Covid-19 peak between May 15 and 30.

“Many of the severe cases in that period could have turned into mortality now, hence the slight rise in deaths in early June,’’ Joshi said.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC will closely monitor the situation over the next 10 days.

“The lockdown was partially lifted a week back and we haven’t witnessed a huge surge in the number of cases, as we had feared. However, we don’t want to let our guard down as the next week to 10 days are crucial,” he said.

Kakani said that the city was ready to handle the cases as the BMC has developed a “good model” as a result of the experience in controlling Covid-19 in the slums of Dharavi and Worli.

“We are using the same successful model in K East and P North wards which have been witnessing a rise in cases in the last week,” the additional municipal commissioner said.

The model entails involving local doctors and clinics to reach out the residents, wide use of pulse oximeters to catch people with early respiratory problems, and holding fever clinics. “We have covered a population of 3 lakh people in our pulse oximeter survey,” Kakani said.

The slum-dominated Dharavi locality on Saturday reported 17 new Covid-19 positive patients. The total number of positive novel coronavirus cases reported from the entire area stands at 2,030, said municipal officials.

Neighbouring Thane city breached the 5,000 mark of Covid-19 cases when 176 patients tested positive within 24 hours on Saturday. Thane recorded five deaths, taking the toll to 153 so far.

In Navi Mumbai, a total of 191 positive novel coronavirus cases were found on Saturday, taking the total Covid-19 count to 3,734. The area under the jurisdiction of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation reported five deaths, taking the toll to 114.
