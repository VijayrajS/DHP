2020-03-16
PUNE: Fergusson College on Sunday fell victim to fake tweets that spread confusion among its students. A tweet carrying the Prime Minister’s photo and the Twitter handle @narendramodi read: “I request principal of Fergusson College to declare holidays till 31 March. Fergusson College is one of the most prestigious colleges of India and we cannot risk the future of our country."


Many students of the college logged on to social media sites to check its authenticity, another fake tweet with the name of the principal of college RS Pardeshi read: “@NarendraModi Bhai nahi ho payega Sorry”

When this tweet was circulated students suspected that the tweets were fake and an act of mischief. Another fake tweet of US President Donald Trump was created and it read: “I had a discussion with prime minister @narendramodi about declaration of holidays in Fergusson College, Pune. Both nations agreed to give holidays till March 31.”

When contacted , Pardeshi said, “We will sit with our IT team and dig into this matter. We will file a complaint with the cyber crime police on Monday.”
