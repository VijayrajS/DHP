Tanakpur (Champawat): The turnout of pilgrims at the ongoing Purnagiri temple fair in Tanakpur received a hit due to the combined effect of coronavirus scare, bad weather conditions, and state board examinations.

Office-bearers of the revered shrine say that the pilgrim footfall has decreased in comparison to previous years. The district officials and organisers of the fair, meanwhile, are hoping that pilgrim footfall would increase after the weather gets clear and state board exams get over.

“We are hoping that the footfall would increase once a special train for the fair, like every year, is started. All preparations have been made for the pilgrims who visit the fair,” Dayanand Saraswati, fair magistrate and sub-divisional magistrate, Tanakpur, told TOI. He added that the administration has made special arrangements to deal with the coronavirus threat and regular check-ups have been arranged. “Teams of doctors have been deployed on both the routes of Indo-Nepal border. Every person coming in from those routes is being screened. Doctors have also been stationed at all the parking lots of the fair complex. Hoardings have been put up to make people aware of coronavirus and mike announcements are also being made,” added Saraswati.
