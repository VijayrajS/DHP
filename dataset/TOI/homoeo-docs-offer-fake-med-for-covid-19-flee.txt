2020-03-22
Salem: Two homoeopathy doctors are likely to face legal action for misleading the public stating that that have preventive medicine for Covid-19. The two had deployed a staff member at Uzhavar Shandy in Hasthampatty area on Saturday morning to lure the public. However, when TOI tried to talk to him, he fled. 

The pamphlet had contact details of doctors - Dr P Elango and Dr E Indrakumar - who were practicing homoeopathy at a clinic on Gandhi road. TOI alerted deputy director of health services Dr J Nirmalson, who tried to reach the two on their mobile phones. “No one picked up the calls. They managed to escape and the clinic was found closed when our team went there,” the officer said. 

He has lodged a complaint with the Hasthampatty police, seeking action against the errant homoeopathic consultants for trying to cheat people. TOI also couldn’t reach the doctors and their mobile phones were switched off since 11am on Saturday.
