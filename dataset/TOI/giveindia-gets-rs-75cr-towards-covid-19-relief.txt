2020-04-15
Bengaluru: A host of corporate bigwigs, entrepreneurs and foundations have contributed to donation platform GiveIndia’s ‘India Covid Response Fund’ (ICRF). Contributors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, Sundar Pichai, HSBC, Omidyar Network India, UBS Optimus Foundation, Marico, Uber, Binny Bansal, Helo (Bytedance) and A.T.E. Chandra Foundation.

“Since we started fundraising for Covid relief work on March 22, we have received donations from more than 2 lakh people globally, raised Rs 75 crore, partnered with 40+ organisations, onboarded 100+ nonprofits, and these initial efforts will impact 1 million people,” Govind Iyer, director, GiveIndia and advisor, ICRF, said. However, he said, the on-ground requirement is much larger and the fund is an open platform for everyone to come together “and support the most critical need of the hour.” The fund’s objective is to create a larger corpus that can support up to 10 million people nationally.

GiveIndia is India’s largest donation platform, connecting donors with NGOs.

ICRF’s advisory group includes Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Dr Devi Shetty, Binny Bansal, Sanjiv Mehta, chairman of Unilever, Amitabh Chaudhry, CEO of Axis Bank, Surendra Rosha, CEO of HSBC India, Manoj Kohli, country head of SoftBank, and others.
