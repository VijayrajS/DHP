2020-04-15
Nashik: The air quality index (AQI) of Nashik city, which had crossed the 100-mark before the lockdown was imposed, has now dropped to 64 (as recorded on April 13). On April 10, the AQI was recorded at 72.

On March 26, the city’s air quality index stood at 23, making it the lowest in the past five years as against 115 recorded on March 2.

On March 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days to contain the spread of Covid-19. A week later, the AQI was recorded below 50.

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) officials said the AQI has reduced at large after the lockdown.

They said that the rise in AQI is because of the re-suspension of the dust particles in the air. Moreover, the vehicles falling under the essential services category are operational in the city. Also, residents are stepping out of their homes and using private vehicles to visit markets to buy essentials like groceries, grains and medicines, said sources in the MPCB.

The activities in both the industrial estates of Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) have completely stopped due to lockdown as part of preventive measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.

AQI rating

As per parameters, AQI between 1 and 50 is said to be ideal and has minimal impact, while AQI between 51 and 100 is said to be satisfactory and may cause minor breathing discomfort. AQI between 101 and 200 is moderate and may cause breathing discomfort among people with lung problems, heart diseases as well as children. The AQI between 201 and 300 can cause breathing discomfort, while AQI between 301 and 400 causes respiratory illness to people after prolonged exposure.
