2020-05-28
Dehradun: Uttarakhand police have decided to deploy drones and install CCTVs to keep a close tab on people put under quarantine to contain the spread of coronavirus in the Himalayan state. 

According to police top brass, close vigil is being kept on people under institutional quarantine so that no one ventures out of the place where they are isolated. 

Ashok Kumar, director general (law and order), told TOI, “We would be taking help of drones and CCTVs to enforce quarantine orders effectively. The aim is to ensure that quarantine orders are followed in true letter and spirit.” The official added that people found flouting quarantine orders would be booked under relevant sections as such violations would put others at risk. 

In all, 18,893 people have been put under institutional quarantine across the state and the figure is rising with more locals, stranded in other states, reaching Uttarakhand.
