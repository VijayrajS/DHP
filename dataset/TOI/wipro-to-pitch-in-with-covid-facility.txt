Wipro to pitch in with Covid-19 facility in Pune
2020-05-06
PUNE: IT major Wipro will convert about 40,000 sqft of space in its tower at Hinjewadi Phase-I campus into a 450-bed facility for Covid-19 patients.


“Wipro has committed to repurpose one of our independent and vacant facilities in Pune into a 450 bed Covid-19 hospital,” Wipro chairman Rishad Premji said.

The firm said it would be handed over to the government by May 30 and be converted back into an IT facility after a year. The facility would be equipped to treat moderate cases and will have 12 beds to stabilise critical patients before shifting them to a tertiary care facility. “This humanitarian contribution by Wipro will strengthen our medical infrastructure and benefit the medical fraternity,” CM Uddhav Thackeray said in a note.

The company has also set up a special project team to execute this at the earliest. “We are about to begin work on this and a project team is looking into its implementation,” said Deepak Trehan, facilities head at Wipro Pune.
