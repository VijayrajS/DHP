2020-06-05
PANAJI/VASCO: Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who on Thursday visited Mangor Hill, Vasco, from where maximum cases have been detected, said that a decision on bringing more areas in Vasco under containment zone for covid management would be taken on Friday based on the test results that are expected to come in.

“We have taken a review and we feel that the situation is under control and that the cases will come down. However, let’s see how many more positive cases are detected on Friday based on which we will take a decision,” Sawant told reporters on Thursday night after taking a review of the situation in the port town along with senior officers.

He said that 30 persons tested positive out of 380 who underwent the covid test on Wednesday. On Thursday, 400 tests were conducted and the results will be out on Friday. There are no cases outside Mangor Hill in the port town, Sawant said, reiterating that there was no reason for panic.

“MLA Carlos Almeida has demanded that the lockdown should be made stricter, but I will first take a review of the situation and then decide,” Sawant said.

The government understands the sentiments of the people, the Mangor Hill area is under complete lockdown and the situation is being monitored very closely, 24X7, Sawant said. “No one will be allowed to move out. Please don’t panic. We need people’s cooperation to fight covid,” the chief minister said.

He said that the Mangor Hill outbreak could not be termed as a case of community transmission. “Local transmission and community transmission are different. The source of the local transmission can be identified and it is limited to a small area. It can be called community transmission if entire Vasco sees cases,” the chief minister said.

During his visit, Sawant had a meeting with urban development minister Milind Naik, Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida, chairperson of MMC Nandadeep Raut, South Goa collector Ajit Roy and others. At Mangor Hill he met the Vasco PI in charge, Paresh Naik.

Mangor ward councillor Pascoal D’Souza informed the CM that people are running short of groceries and there are labourers who don’t have money. Sawant assured that by evening groceries would be made available to them. He also assured free supply to the needy. 

Survey of other slum-like hutments where homes are in proximity has been started, he added.
