Rajasthani women collaborate on virtual ghoomar video during coronavirus lockdown
2020-04-24
Just days after the lockdown announcement, when Rajnigandha Shekhawat posted on her social media account, urging women to be a part of her upcoming ghoomar video, she didn’t expect a lot of responses. But the Rajasthani singer was bombarded with messages from women expressing their desire to be a part of the video.

“The idea was to make a crowd-sourced video. I asked the shortlisted women to wear the traditional Rajasthani poshak, record their dance at home and send the videos to me. Then I clubbed all the clippings for my 10-minute song, which is a medley of eight popular folk songs of Rajasthan,” Rajnigandha tells us. The songs include hit numbers such as Ghoomar, Mehala Neeche Sa, Naina Ra Lobhi and Bajuband Ri Loom.

The video features 12 Rajasthani women, including Rajnigandha, from various parts of the world, including England. “Women featured in the video are from various walks of life and places, including Jaipur, Sikar, Danta, Udaipur, Ujjain and even the United Kingdom. A 5-year-old girl has sent her video from England,” she says.
