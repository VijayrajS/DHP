Telangana: CCMB, CDFD await kits for Covid-19 testing
2020-03-23
HYDERABAD: The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) are ready for Covid-19 testing, but they are still waiting to receive the testing kits from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) or to be imported. 


On Saturday, the Centre had permitted the Telangana government to utilise the services of CCMB and CDFD for Covid-19 testing. The permission was given after a request by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during the video conference with PM Narendra Modi on Friday.

CCMB director Rakesh Mishra told TOI that they are making efforts to develop coronavirus testing kits. “Companies, including a few startups in CCMB lab, are working on it. We are hoping to achieve certain results in a couple of weeks.”

Mishra said, “We haven’t got the kits yet and we have approached ICMR and other agencies concerned. We are also trying to import the kits, but there is a shortage going in. In CCMB, we have the capacity to conduct screening of 25,000 samples in two weeks. Every day we can do 1,000 tests. Other centres in Hyderabad may have a capacity of testing 100 each day. We will get clarity on availability of kits in a couple of days. We will also be validating which kits have to be used” 

Experts said if the community transmission happens on a large scale then there will be flood of samples and it would be difficult to handle the situation with the current number of kits available.

Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR test is being conducted for coronavirus. Currently, Gandhi Hospital, Osmania General Hospital (OGH), Institute of Preventive Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital (MGM) in Warangal and Nizam’s Institute Of Medical Sciences (NIMS) have been given the nod to conduct Covid-19 test.

A spokesperson from Telangana health ministry said, “Gandhi Hospital has been conducting the tests, while OGH has started conducting the tests recently. NIMS is working to establish the systems in a separate building, while Warangal MGM can’t conduct the tests immediately as it does not have the equipments. The state has decided to procure equipments from elsewhere as there is no import from China.”

He said that CCMB has been training state staff for conducting tests. “We have trained staff of Gandhi Hospital, OGH and other institutes. Today, the first batch went out and tomorrow, the second batch is coming soon. We will be training around 25 lab experts,” said Mishra.

CDFD director Debashish Mitra said, “We have initiated the process and we do have the required equipment. Once we are ready, we will need kits and will start conducting the tests.”
