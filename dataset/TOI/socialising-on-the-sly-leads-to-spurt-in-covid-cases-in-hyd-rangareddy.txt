Socialising on the sly leads to spurt in Covid cases in Hyderabad & Rangareddy
2020-05-27
HYDERABAD: While the health officials rack their brains on the pattern of novel coronavirus spreading in Greater Hyderabad limits and Rangareddy district, ‘secret socialising’ is what’s leading to a spurt in the positive cases, it is learnt.


A majority of the Covid-19 positive cases reported on Tuesday relate to people contracting the virus after attending social gatherings. Four members of a software engineer’s family in Kondapur and 19 persons in a single family in Pahadishareef contracted the virus, owing to secret socialising. 




The case of techie, who tested positive, is interesting as he insisted that he had gone to the market only once in the last two months. When police stepped in and spoke to him, he spilled the beans. He had met one of his friends who returned from Mumbai. While the techie tested positive a few days ago, his family members are now Covid-19 positive.

A youngster from Borabanda was infected with the virus a few days ago after he attended a small party in Pahadishareef along with his wife. He turned out to be a ‘super spreader’ is his area with 15 persons testing positive on Tuesday. “He had also visited his relatives in Maheswaram, spreading the infection to four others,” an official said. Officials say this is worrying as another 100 people are to be quarantined because of the super spreader.
