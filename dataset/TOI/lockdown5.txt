Lockdown 5
2020-06-01
Lockdown 4 is ending today and lockdown 5 will come into effect from tomorrow. But as per the guidelines announced, the relaxations take place from 8th June 2020, onwards. what happens between 1st to 7th June? Which lockdown and what restrictions apply? Why 8th is chosen? It appears some Pandit must have given the Muhurat date of 8th.It is repeatedly said that Sr. Citizens should stay at home. Me and my wife are both Sr Citizens living alone and nobody else. what do we do for our survival, purchase if Medicines, provisions, vegetables, fruits etc. What if I have to call a repairer for repairing, our washing machine, AC, mixer grinder in kitchen etc. Who is going to come to our assistance. We have to venture out. How will Government protect us? If they can't then they should not speak.
