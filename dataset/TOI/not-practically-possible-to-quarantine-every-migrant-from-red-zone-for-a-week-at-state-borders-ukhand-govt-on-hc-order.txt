Not practically possible to quarantine every migrant from red zone for a week at state borders: U’khand govt on HC order
2020-05-22
Dehradun: A day after the Nainital high court (HC) directed the state government to establish quarantine centres at the borders and keep every migrant coming from red zones across the country at the centres for a week, the state government said “it’s not practically possible to do so.” 

Reacting to the HC order, cabinet minister and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said on Thursday, “We have received the directive from the high court and in the next court date, we are going to inform the HC that it is not practically possible to have quarantine facility for such a large number of people that are expected to cross the state’s borders. It will be a tough ask to house so many people who are returning and making food arrangements for them.”
 
The minister added that over 2.5 lakh people have registered themselves to return to Uttarakhand, of which over 1.53 lakh have already come back. “In all, we are estimating that around 5 lakh people will return to the state in the next few weeks. Suppose on an average, 6,000 people are coming to Uttarakhand every day and if we keep them in quarantine near the borders for 10 days, the number of people would swell to 60,000 by the 10th day. We do not have this kind of facility available with us although we have the required number of isolation beds and quarantine centres for patients and suspects. We will inform the HC and act accordingly.” 

The HC had on Wednesday also directed the state government to test each quarantined migrant showing symptoms of novel coronavirus. Reacting to this, Kaushik said, “The ICMR had earlier stopped the rapid test and had later revised its order. We will discuss the issue with the Centre and then take appropriate action.”
