Industrialists seek easing of lockdown
2020-04-29
Mumbai: Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra (top) on Tuesday suggested a “comprehensive” lifting of lockdown after 49 days. “Research suggests a 49-day lockdown is optimal. If true, then post that duration, I believe the lifting of the lockout should be comprehensive,” he said.

“If a ‘calibrated’ lifting of the lockdown means the sequential opening of different parts of the country, then industrial recovery will be painfully slow. In manufacturing, if even one feeder factory is still locked down, then the final product assembly will be stalled,” he said.

Industrialist Sajjan Jindal said early measures are needed to prevent the country’s economy from falling into a slumber. “The lockdown has had a positive effect, but it is imperative to also move focus on economic wellbeing, the JSW Group chairman said. “We need to rise now to ensure that the economy does not fall into a slumber that will take huge efforts to awaken. A depression in the economy is also a threat to this nation,” he said in a statement. He added that we need to find ways to work within a ‘new normal’ to bring the economy back to capacity fast.
