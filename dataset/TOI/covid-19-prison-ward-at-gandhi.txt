HYDERABAD: Authorities at Gandhi Hospital, along with the city police, set up a Covid-19 isolation ward for prisoners on Thursday. The 23-year-old man arrested by Chilakalguda police for assaulting a doctor was the first inmate to be admitted at the ward. 


“We have turned the ward into Covid-only and other inmates have shifted to Osmania General Hospital. Prisoners with symptoms and their primary contacts will be kept in this isolation ward,” said Dr P Shravan Kumar, Gandhi Hospital superintendent. 

Two brothers who were arrested by the Afzulgunj police for assaulting doctors at OGH have also been shifted to the ward. They are primary contacts of their father, who had tested positive. 

“We are deploying a team of five armed guards at the Covid-19 prisoner ward. The guards will be provided with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE),” North Zone DCP Kalmeshwar Shingenavar said.

Gandhi Hospital is currently guarded round the clock by 240 cops, who are working in three shifts.

Hospital sources said that 440 positive patients are undergoing treatment in four floors of the G+8 building. 

“Covid-19 patients are not causing any problems. Those who are suspects and kept in isolation wards become restless sometimes and try to argue with the medical staff about letting them go home. We explain to them that mandatory quarantine period of 14 days has to be followed and convince them to not cause any trouble,” said a police official posted at Gandhi Hospital.
