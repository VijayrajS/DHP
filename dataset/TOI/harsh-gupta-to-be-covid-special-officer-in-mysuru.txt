2020-04-14
Mysuru: The state government has appointed 1997-batch IAS officer Harsh Gupta as special officer to oversee Covid-related cases in Mysuru, which has recorded the highest number of positive case after Bengaluru.

Harsh Gupta, who is secretary to government, on Monday held a meeting with district authorities at the DC’s office to take stock of the situation in Mysuru. His appointment would help government to effectively devise strategies to tackle the virus in coordination with deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar.

Harsh Gupta was formerly deputy commissioner of Mysuru and his appointment as special officer indicates that chief minister BS Yediyurappa doesn’t want to take chances with regard to tackling the Covid virus in Mysuru which has reported 48 positive cases. Currently, 38 covid cases are active while ten have been cured of illness and were discharged from hospital.

For the last three-and-a- half weeks, DC Abhiram G Sankar has effectively handled the situation in the district, be it of Nanjangud’s pharmaceutical firm-related cases or of Tablighi Jamaat delegates, both of whom have contributed to the rise in the number of covid positive cases in Mysuru.
