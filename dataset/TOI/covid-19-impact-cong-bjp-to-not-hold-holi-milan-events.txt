2020-03-07
DEHRADUN: The state units of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have cancelled their “Holi Milan” events in the wake of coronavirus scare.


Uttarakhand Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI that they will not hold any official Holi Milan this year but party members are free to hold personal events. “The party president has already sent circulars to all respective district presidents to not organise any mass gathering events on Holi,” he said, while adding that the state government doesn't seem to have made the preparations required to combat the virus.

Similarly, the BJP state brass has also said that they will not hold any Holi Milan events this year. Uttarakhand BJP spokesperson Devendra Bhasin confirmed that the saffron party has cancelled all such events. City mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama has also cancelled his Goa trip on account of the coronavirus scare.

On Friday, Dehradun district magistrate (DM) Ashish Shrivastava urged residents to not spread misinformation on coronavirus through social media platforms and added that those found involved in such activities will be booked under relevant sections.

“We have ensured isolation wards at all city hospitals and are ready to deal with any coronavirus patient. People must refrain from spreading misinformation on the virus. FIRs will be registered against those who spread misinformation which adds to panic among residents,” said the DM.

Meanwhile, there were complaints by many residents that there was rampant black marketing of N95 masks in the city. “I bought an N95 mask for Rs 400 from a chemist at Rajpur Road. It earlier cost just Rs 150. Shopkeepers are milking the crisis to extract more money from people. The state government must check this,” said Gautam Sinha, a city-based academician.
