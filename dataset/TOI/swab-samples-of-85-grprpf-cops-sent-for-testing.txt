Lucknow: With a threat of Covid-19 outbreak looming over ranks of railway cops — GRP and RPF — health authorities on Friday launched a massive testing drive. Swab samples of 85 constables deployed at Charbagh railway station to manage migrant workers were sent for testing to KGMU.

Deputy CMO Dr Ravi Panday said, “Samples of 70 GRP jawans and 15 RPF constables have been sent for testing. Reports would come on Sunday.”

Ten railway cops, including nine GRP and one RPF, have tested positive since Sunday. All were deployed to manage migrants arriving at Charbagh railway station through Shramik Specials. As many as 59 GRP jawans have been quarantined and 89, including families, have been tested.

Meanwhile, after TOI highlighted how GRP jawans were ignoring safety norms at the station, officers swung into action and visited Charbagh railway station to ensure implementation of rules for protection against infection.

On Thursday, TOI had found that only a few cops at platform one were wearing face shield, masks and gloves. The same was seen on Friday when TOI visited the place around 2.30pm.

However, things changed after ADG, GRP, and other senior officers visited the railway station on Friday evening.

TOI went back at 5.45pm and found all cops wearing face shields, gloves and masks when a Shramik Special arrived. Most cops also followed social distancing and were avoiding assembling at one spot. A few were still seen mingling without physical distancing.

SP, GRP, Saumitra Yadav said senior officers told cops that following safety protocols is for their well being and of their families.
