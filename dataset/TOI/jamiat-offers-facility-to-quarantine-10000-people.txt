HYDERABAD: Amidst the ongoing controversy over linking spurt in coronavirus cases to Markaz Nizamuddin, the international headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat, the Jamiat Ulema Hind offered to provide help in setting up a quarantine facility for about 10,000 people across the country.


Jamiat Ulema Hind is an organisation of Muslim clergy or ulema holding influence over imams (people who lead prayers in mosques) of thousands of mosques across India. Jamiat general secretary and Islamic scholar Moulana Mahmood Madani has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi offering quarantine facility for 10,000 people.

Madani said war against novel coronavirus cannot be fought without involving all sections of people. “It is our duty in this hour of crisis to extend helping hand to the government and contain the spread of the disease,” he said, adding that coronavirus is a challenge to humanity.

He said more quarantine centres across India may be needed to be set up if more number of positive cases are reported. The Jamiat units in all states are ready to help the health authorities in setting up these isolation facilities, he said. He also said the Jamiat units are already working to provide food and shelter to migrant workers and people held up due to sudden lockdown across the country.

Meanwhile, Tablighi Jamaat also offered its Markaz in old Delhi as quarantine facility. The Markaz is six-storey building and serves as guesthouse.
