BENGALURU: Constable N Guruswamy, 37, who was the first member of Bengaluru police force to test positive for coronavirus, has recovered and was discharged from Victoria Hospital on Saturday. The force organised a warm celebration for him.


“The nine days I spent in the hospital are unforgettable. I thank my family and the department for the support they extended. Special thanks to Dr Asima Bhanu who was like a mother to me,” Guruswamy told STOI after hospital discharge.

He was admitted to Victoria Hospital on May 22. On Saturday, police officials, including Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao, waited for him outside the hospital gates. As Guruswamy stepped out at 5.10pm, they gave him a red-carpet welcome, applauding and showering rose petals on him. A police band also performed.

The police convoy carrying him first went to the police commissioner’s office and then to Guruswamy’s residence in Adugodi. 

“I was nervous when I found out that I was positive. Senior police officials, including commissioner Rao and joint commissioner BR Ravikante Gowda spoke to me and said there was nothing to worry,” Guruswamy said.

He felt dejected during the first couple of days. “I felt like everything was over. Slowly, confidence grew, though I was worried about my wife Mamata and sons Vishwas and Rithiwik,” he said.

Four constables from Bagalkot and one from Vijayapura had tested positive for coronavirus in March and April. All of them have recovered. As on Saturday, 12 police officials in different parts of state are being treated for Covid-19.
