Crime branch goes Sherlock to track coronavirus footprints in Bhopal
2020-05-19
BHOPAL: The silent Corona warriors — city crime branch cops — have been tracking the contact history of Covid-19 patients like a crime investigation. As soon as they get the list of positive patients, five teams of the crime branch track each and every person they came in contact with so that their testing is done. Crime detection techniques like tracing the mobile location of the patient are also being used by the cops to identify and track the people who came in direct contact with the Covid-19 patient.


Silent warriors like crime branch are playing the most important role of breaking the chain of the deadly disease. The primary responsibility of tracking the patient’s contact history is of health workers, but given the special ability of the crime branch which is armed with various digital techniques to track people, police were made partner in this most important task. 

Around 1,000 samples are being taken and sent for testing from the city each.

ASP (Crime Branch) Nishchal Jharia said that on April 9, the crime branch was given the responsibility of contact history tracking of Covid-19 patients. As soon as crime branch was given the charge, five teams were formed comprising a DSP-level officer, who leads the team, three sub-inspectors and around 6-7 policemen. The teams investigate each and every corona positive patient’s contact history like a blind crime. The city is divided into four police zones and one team each is responsible to track the contact history of patients found in their assigned zone.

ASP Jharia said that a special format has been created to keep the record of first contacts, who came in contact with the affected person and their names, age, relation to patient, address, record of sampling, test result if received, and medical history. Police also records the names of neighbours, friends, tenants if any, colleagues and the shops, including grocery shops/milk parlour where the patient visited.

ASP Jharia said that every day, there are 3-4 such corona-positive patients in the list whose address and phone numbers are not clear, so it becomes difficult to track them. 

ASP Jharia said that once the contact history of Covid-19 patients is recorded, it is properly compiled in tabular format. Police tracks the contact history of the corona-positive patients and shares the data with health department, BMC and district administration.
