Lucknow: Covid situation an opportunity to create hygienic meat market, say doctors
2020-05-23
LUCKNOW: When relaxations were announced for lockdown 4.0 earlier this week, 30-year-old Sagar Verma had hoped only for one thing—reopening of meat shops. 


A patient of rheumatoid arthritis since the age of 10years, his doctor had advised him to eat fish or chicken at least twice a week as part of his intense treatment. 

 


However, ever since the lockdown began on March 25, Verma has not been able to procure meat in any market. “I need to gain weight and muscle and have been asked to eat animal protein. However, since the lockdown began, no chicken or fish is available anywhere. Frozen meat is too expensive. When will the administration allow shops to open,” he said. 

TOI had reported on Thursday how meat sellers are unable to resume sales because of a five-year-old licence tangle. Until it is resolved, people like Verma and others for whom meat eating is a choice will suffer.

According to Dr Vineeta Das, head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at KGMU, “High protein diet is required by several people including pregnant women, growing children and the elderly. While sources of protein are many, meat has the highest content. Buying meat from a clean space is most important at this time. Even if shops are allowed to sell meat, people will be scared to buy due to hygiene issues. A designated clean meat market is the need of the hour.” 

Dr Pramod Agarwal, a senior dermatologist, said, “The Covid situation is an opportunity for the administration to streamline the system and create a hygienic space for meat sale. If the licence issue in not getting resolved, the administration should reach a compromise with vendors. Meat sellers should also comply in whatever they can.”
