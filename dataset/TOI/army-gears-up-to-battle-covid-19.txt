Army gears up to battle Covid-19
2020-03-28
Hyderabad: The Indian Army in Secunderabad has set up quarantine centres for its personnel. Resident welfare associations have been deputed as ‘procurement officers’ to supply essentials, including vegetables, dairy products, cereals, medicines, to the families.

Delivery of items to the separated families (husbands on duty in field areas), is carried out twice a week and to regimental colonies once a week. Arrangements have been made for the products available at unit run canteens to be delivered at doorsteps as well.

Movement of army vehicles has been restricted to essential duties only and all vehicles are being sanitised twice daily. Military hospitals are maintaining a close liaison with state and district health officials. TNN
