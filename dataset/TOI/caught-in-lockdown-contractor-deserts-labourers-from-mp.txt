Caught in lockdown, contractor ‘deserts’ labourers from MP
2020-04-14
Yavatmal: Over 30 labourers have been deprived of essential commodities for the last four days as the contractor who had hired them is now unreachable for the last several days. 

The labourers, mostly from Madhya Pradesh, have been staying near a construction site in cotton market area on Dhamangaon Road, along with their women and kids.

Food packets were distributed to them till Saturday by a group led by MLA Madan Yerawar. But that too has now stopped.

According to Ambilal Pandhare, a resident of Kumarikala village in Lanji tehsil in Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh, the workers were brought to Yavatmal by a Pandharkawda-based private contractor Pratap Samastha on January 15 and deployed them at a construction site.

“We were given Rs1,000 per week by the contractor till the lockdown was announced. Thereafter, the contractor had gone to Pandharkawda where he is reportedly held-up due to the imposition of curfew,” said Pandhare.

“A local NGO provided us with some food packets and provisions. But it has also stopped now,” he said.

Ambilal and others want to go back to their native village at the earliest and since the lockdown is extended till April 30, they are more worried about the little kids.

Yavatmal tehsildar Kunal Zalte told TOI on Monday that he visited the site and also contacted the contractor with the help of Pandharkawda tehsildar. “I have urged officials there to issue a special pass to the contractor so that he could travel to Yavatmal and take care of the labourers,” said Zalte. Till then, some NGOs would be roped in to provide food and essentials to the labourers, he added.
