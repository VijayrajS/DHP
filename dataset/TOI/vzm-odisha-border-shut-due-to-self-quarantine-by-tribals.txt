VZM-Odisha border shut due to self-quarantine by tribals
2020-03-28
Vizianagaram: Self-quarantine has taken a different turn in the porous Vizianagaram-Odisha tribal belt. While villagers in the plains have imposed a strict quarantine, tribals in the porous areas have sealed off their villages.

Sources in the forest department said that out of the 14 mandals in the Parvathipuram division, most share a very porous border with Koraput and Raigada districts in Odisha. Usually these routes are not monitored as they are not easy to reach. Many of these routes have been used for illegal across the border trade.

Due to Covid-19 scare, very few are slipping through the borders.

“Most of the border villagers are tribal. Many of their relatives live across the border in the districts of Odisha. Usually the locals use these paths to sidestep border norms,” said, G Lakshman Rao, DFO, Vizianagaram.

The forest department sources said the porous borders have always been used to sell banned commodities. “Now no one is willing to cross the border due to community quarantine by tribals living in these hamlets. The tribals have ensured that no outsider is allowed entry and no resident allowed to step out for too long,” said sources.

G Lachiah, a tribal and former president of Padmapuram village in Pachipenta mandal said: “We have decided to discourage people to leave the tribal villages. And people are taking no chances with Covid-19.”

Non-tribals from neighboring villages and mandals, who have used these routes to buy and sell are feeling the pinch. B Poli Raju, a native of Pachipenta village, said: “ Country liquor and tobacco products used to be easily available till recently. Now Covid-19 threat has ensured that nobody ventures out or walks in.”
