Birthday surprise for quarantined kid in Rohtas
2020-05-24
PATNA: For five-year-old Ankur Kumar, it was a birthday with a difference on Friday. Those present on the occasion were not his dear ones, but migrant workers staying at a quarantine centre at Patluka under Tilauthu block in Rohtas district.

The birthday cake was gifted to the boy by Dehri SDO Lal Jyotinath Shahdev. Ankur with his father Ajit Sharma (33), mother Poonam Devi (30) and younger sister Pallavi (3), is staying at the quarantine centre ever since the family reached from Indore in Madhya Pradesh on May 12.

Ankur’s father Sharma said, “We had not expected such an overwhelming response. The birthday cake was presented by a senior administrative officer while the inmates of the quarantine centre blessed Ankur. The cake was distributed with social distancing norms. DM Pankaj Dixit also sent his message, congratulating Ankur on his fifth birthday.”

Incharge of the quarantine centre Anil Kumar Singh said Ankur looked upset as he was away from home on his birthday. “His father shared his concern with me and I discussed the matter with the inmates of the centre, who readily agreed,” Singh said.
