Lucknow: The UP government has released 10,438 prisoners on interim bail and eight-week parole, following a Supreme Court directive to decongest jails in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last month, the apex court directed states and union territories to consider releasing convicts sentenced to seven years or less and also those awaiting trial entailing less than seven-year imprisonment.

In a seven-day span, 2,110 convicts were released on parole and 8,328 undertrials on interim bail in consultation with the state government, said director-general of prisons and reform, Anand Kumar. The government had set a target of releasing 11,000 prisoners to declog jails. The prisoners, who are being ferried by state roadways buses to their home districts, have been provided with masks and pamphlets detailing ways to avoid coronavirus infection.

Additional chief secretary (home, prisons) Awanish Awasthi told TOI efforts are being made to release more prisoners, including 238 juvenile offenders. 

A maximum of 428 prisoners were released from Agra district jail, followed by 328 from Lucknow. “All those released were given pamphlets and face masks for spreading awareness on the pandemic. The pamphlets include do’s and don’ts during the lockdown and how to shield against the virus,” said DG Prisons, Anand Kumar.

A team of doctors was formed in each prison cell to conduct a thorough check-up of prisoners before letting them out. A report on each prisoner has been prepared and this will be checked after their return after 2 months, said prison officials.
