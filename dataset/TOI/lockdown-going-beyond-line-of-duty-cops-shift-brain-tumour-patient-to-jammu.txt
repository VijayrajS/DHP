JAMMU: Going beyond the line of duty, Udhampur police under its #JKP CARES campaign set an example by managing to shift a sick person to hospital.


A police spokesperson from Udhampur said, “Police received an information that one boy, namely Rohit Kumar, a resident of Bachhal-Sudhmahadev, was operated few days ago for brain tumour and his health condition had deteriorated. His parents were unable to take him to Jammu for treatment due to lockdown restrictions.”

On getting information, a police party from Sudhmadev, led by sub-inspector Arun Singh Slathia, arranged for inter-district movement pass and vehicle for the patient to reach the hospital in Jammu.

“Exhibiting a humane gesture, the police party also contributed Rs 5,000 as financial help for the needs family. “Relatives and locals appreciated the efforts of police, due to which the ailing person was shifted to hospital timely and his treatment too has started,” the police spokesperson added.
