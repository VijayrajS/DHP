2020-04-25
NEW DELHI: The Crime Branch allegedly came across 11 bank accounts of Tablighi Jamaat in which large sums of money had been deposited and immediately withdrawn. Police also came across 18 mobile numbers that were linked to these accounts. When cops tried to contact these numbers, they were found to be non-functional. Police would share the details of these bank accounts with the Enforcement Directorate.

Sources said that they would also question an employee of Nizamuddin Markaz, identified as Javed, who used to look after the finances. It was found that a bulk of money used to be deposited to an account and then immediately distributed into the other books of accounts. These transfers would go on through the year and peaked in March.

Bank officials had sought a meeting with Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad Kandhlavi in this regard, but were asked to meet Javed for clarifications. The officials were told that in order to meet Kandhlavi they would have to come through the proper channel since he only met people through appointments. The accounts in which the money was transferred belonged to other maulanas attached with the Markaz.

Meanwhile, Kandhlavi said that he was open to questioning by Delhi Police, who are aware of his whereabouts. He further claimed that the medical tests that the cops had asked him to get done from a government hospital were completed.
