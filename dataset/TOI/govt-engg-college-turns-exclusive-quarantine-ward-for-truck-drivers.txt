DHARMAPURI: The district administration has set up an exclusive quarantine ward for truck drivers in order to screen the ones who have returned from other states.


The ward is set up at Government College of Engineering campus at Chettikarai.

Dharmapuri’s lone positive Covid-19 case was a truck driver, who contracted the virus after travelling to Karnataka and southern districts in Tamil Nadu as part of his work.

After he tested positive, district collector S Malarvizhi had directed health department officials to set up the quarantine ward for truck drivers. “We have identified truck drivers who have reached Dharmapuri after travelling back from other districts and states as part of their work,” she said. 

All the drivers have been kept at the quarantine centre for 14 days.

The quarantine ward was set up 10 days ago. At least 1,803 truck drivers have been tested for Covid-19 at the centre. “We conduct tests for the drivers and send them out if the results are negative,” the collector said. 

After a quarantine of 14 days, drivers are tested again for Covid-19 and are discharged if they are found negative.

After testing all the truck drivers in the district, the administration has now begun testing people entering the district from other states for Covid 19. Positive cases are being sent for quarantine at the centre, an official said.
