AGRA: A 58-year-old senior conductor with Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) who was found Covid-19 positive, died on Tuesday night at SN Medical College (SNMC) in Agra. His family alleged he was not provided ventilator support and died due to lack of proper medical treatment. 

Dujendra Prasad Sharma, who lived in Awadhpuri locality, was diabetic. After he contracted fever, he was admitted to SNMC on April 30, where samples were collected from all patients for Covid-19 tests. On May 2, the results arrived; he had been found negative. 

His son Vinay Sharma said, “My father was not getting proper treatment at SNMC. His condition kept deteriorating. We managed to shift him to a private hospital in the morning May 3, where he got a bit of relief. Fresh samples were taken for Covid-19 testing at a private lab. On May 4, we come to know he was found positive. In the evening of May 5, my father was shifted back to SNMC, this time to the isolation ward. At around 10.30pm on Tuesday, we came to know he is no more.”

UPSRTC regional manager M K Trivedi said, “We are deeply pained by the demise of our employee. He was responsible for all clerical duties at the Idgah depot. We’re with Sharma’s family in their hour of grief. Proceedings for suitable compensation to the family have been initiated.”
