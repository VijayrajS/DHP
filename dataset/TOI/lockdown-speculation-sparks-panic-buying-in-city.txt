JAIPUR: City on Wednesday witnessed panic buying by residents following speculation that the Centre may impose another lockdown from June 15 due to surge in fresh Covid cases. Many shops saw more than usual footfall of buyers.

Mridul Jain, 61-year-old housewife, said, “We have stocked essential items as a precautionary measure. During the last lockdown, we had experienced that I and my husband found it difficult to order items online. The online stores during the lockdown were taking time in delivering essential items too,” she said.

The shopkeepers also agreed that people are coming out for buying ration for the whole month. They have also placed their orders for essential items with the wholesalers. The items which are in high demand include oil, flour, rice, pulses, spices, packed food etc.

Rajendra Kahtegar, a Raja Park-based grocery retailer, said, “Many of the regular customers are buying groceries for up to two months as they are worried that another round of lockdown can be enforced. Most of them who are ordering or visiting are elderly people as they were the once who faced major problems during previous lockdown.”

Other than grocery stores, huge footfall was witnessed at tobacco and liquor shops as many do not want to repeat mistakes like the previous time.

“After the ‘news’ spread that there will be another round of lockdown, the tobacco sellers increased the prices on Wednesday. Even, the lockdown is not imposed, there will be shortage of gutkas in the city as people are buying it in large numbers,” said Ramakanth Pandit, a resident of Subash Chowk in Walled City area.

Many liquor shopowners, who were witnessing less sales were also happy about the high revenue collection.

Jitnedra Singh, a shopowner in Jawahar Nagar, said, “Since the time shops are open, there was an average demand of liquor. On Wednesday, many people came out to buy wine, especially cartons of beer,” he said.
