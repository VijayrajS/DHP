DEHRADUN: An American woman who had spent two weeks in Rishikesh in March created a stir in the yoga town when she put up a post on Facebook a few days ago after she had returned to the US that she has been found Covid-19 positive. In the post which she put up on a friend’s timeline, she alerted that all those with whom she had come in contact with in Rishikesh, should get themselves checked. The woman had stayed at a resort in the Tapovan area when she was in Rishikesh from March 2 to 14.


Speaking to TOI about the issue, Dr Jagdish Joshi, health department in-charge of Tapovan area, said, “The woman’s friends told us that she has written — I was with you guys for a long time and now, I am tested positive for coronavirus so I request all of you to please get yourself tested and take care.”

In another post, she told her social media friends that she became asymptomatic on March 23. “The incubation period is from my last day in New Delhi, the two days travel and my week home. Who knows really where I got it from. Thank you all for your wishes. Please everyone follow the guidelines set forth by your medical communities,” she wrote further.

The health department, on the basis of her hotel and travel details, identified 27 people who have been quarantined for 14 days. Among those she met were some children in a local school in Rishikesh as well. Health officials said that none of the people have so far showed any symptoms. 

Meanwhile, it also came to light that the woman had stayed in Delhi’s Paharganj area for about five days.

“We are writing to the medical authorities in Delhi to get the locations she had stayed in, so that people she came in contact with can be alerted,” Dr Joshi said.
