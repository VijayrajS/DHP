For the first time, IMA passing out parade to not have parents & kin of cadets due to Covid-19 threat

Dehradun: The forthcoming Passing Out Parade (POP) for the summer batch at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) which is scheduled to be held on June 13 will be a toned-down affair in the wake of the Covid-19 threat, as per officials of the academy. For perhaps the first time ever, parents and relatives of the passing-out batch will not be in attendance to watch the ceremony. 

This would mean that a major tradition of the POP– the pipping ceremony in which parents and family members of the gentlemen cadets (GCs) formally pin the stars on their uniform marking their transition from cadet to officer – will be sans the GCs’ families. IMA authorities said that the decision was taken to ensure the safety and health of the would-be officers and their family members. 

Public relations officer (PRO) of IMA, Lt Col Amit Dagar told TOI that as per his knowledge, this would be the first time that parents will not be attending the POP in IMA. “This would be a break from tradition but it is being done to ensure safety of everyone at the academy.” 

The academy has also requested the media to “give real-time coverage of the event to the rest of the country so that parents of the GCs get to see their brave sons on the most important day of their lives.”

Commenting on the number of cadets passing out this year and who would be the reviewing officer of the parade, Lt Col Dagar said that the final list of cadets, which includes those from friendly foreign countries, is being prepared and the details of the reviewing officer would also be shared as soon as the approval for the same arrives. 

Incidentally, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had also conducted an E-passing out parade on April 24.
