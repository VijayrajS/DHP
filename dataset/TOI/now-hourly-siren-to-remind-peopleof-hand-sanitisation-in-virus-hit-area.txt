2020-05-26
Meerut: With the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Mandi, police have started an innovative way of ensuring public health awareness by playing siren every hour with directions to sanitise hands every time to prevent spread of the virus.

According to guidelines, shopkeepers are supposed to clean their own and their customers' hands every time the siren is played. In the last week, more than a 100 cases were reported from operators in Mandi. Sadar Dal Mandi opens for four hours every morning.

Sadar Bazar SHO Vijay Gupta said, "Sadar Bazar Mandi is one of the most frequented places during relief hours in the morning. And there have been incidents of sudden rise in the Covid-19 positive cases among vendors. To ensure maximum caution at this juncture, we started playing siren installed at nearby police station every hour with directions to shopkeepers and vendors to sanitise hands, including that of their customers. At least, this will keep them on alert."
