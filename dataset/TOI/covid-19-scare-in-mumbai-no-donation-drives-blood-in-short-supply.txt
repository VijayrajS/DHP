The city requires 1,000 units of blood daily, while the state needs 5,000 units. “The State Blood Transfusion Council has put out need protocols to ensure donors are safe and regular disinfection is carried out at blood banks,” said Shetty. He added that the Siddhivinayak Temple trust, Prabhadevi, will hold daily donation camps from March 23 to 31, where donors will get special time slots to avoid crowding.

Sion Hospital dean Dr Mohan Joshi asked people to come to the hospital blood bank from Monday onwards to donate blood.
