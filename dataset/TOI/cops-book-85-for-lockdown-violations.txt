2020-05-17
NAGPUR: City police have registered 85 offences against lockdown violators, detained 29 persons, and fined another 928 for breaching traffic norms on Saturday. A total of 1,042 cases were slapped on the violators.


Having come under criticism for slackness on road, especially during the third phase of lockdown, city police have now decided to register more offences rather than take coercive actions. On Friday, 76 offences were registered against violators and 20 were detained.

Joint CP Ravindra Kadam said many people had started taking undue advantage assuming that the lockdown has been relaxed. “There are relaxations in some sectors apart from the order of unhindered flow of the essential commodities and emergency services in the market but it does not mean that the citizens can step out without reason. Hence, we have stepped up our actions,” he said.
