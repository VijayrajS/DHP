The state has issued a circular inviting schools to send their students to participate in the event likely to make it to the ‘world record book’.


Though the number of students has not been finalised, they have been asked to attend the rehearsals from April 15 to 19, as per the circular issued by the directorate of education (DoE).

On Friday, DoE had issued a circular cancelling Class IX and XI school exams, including the XII board exams. On the same day, the directorate also issued this circular to secondary and higher secondary schools asking them to ‘encourage students to participate in the world Asia record event’.

“Students from all schools are invited to participate in the surya namaskar event to be registered in the Asia Book of Record from 3.30pm to 7pm in the presence of Baba Ramdev along with chief minister of Goa,” director of education Vandana Rao has told government, aided and unaided schools.

“Students will have to perform 108 sets of surya namaskars to set the record,” Rao said. The number of students required though has not been stated.

The event is being organised by Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Yuva Bharat, a youth wing of Bharat Swabhiman Trust and Patanjali Yogpeeth.
