‘Akashwani’ warns Barodians against breaking lockdown
2020-04-11
Vadodara: A sudden burst of ‘akashwani’ took Barodians by surprise on Friday, especially that seemed to sound very stern warning people to stay indoors and not to roam around. With Old City citizens flouting the lockdown rules willy-nilly, especially in narrow lanes, harassed cops came up an idea to attach a voice to the pair of eyes that were already scanning things from the skies. Looking at the impact of the drone monitoring on the people who literally flee indoors if they see a drone flying over their heads, cops fitted the drone cameras with speakers that constantly relayed warning to the people to stay indoors. “Citizens are informed that they are safe indoors and they shouldn’t be flouting lockdown and venturing out without any valid reason,” said Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner. The drones are also spreading awareness messages and safety measures to be taken by people. Since many days, the police was warning citizens by relaying messages through loudspeakers installed in auto rickshaws. But the cops decided to take to the skies as they were not able to reach out to the narrow lanes and interiors. The new method comes in handy to reach to the red zone areas like Nagarwada and Tandalja that has been blocked for outsiders. “We have also deployed separate teams to monitor the by-lanes in the walled city. These teams will ride on motorbikes and do patrolling in areas where four-wheelers can’t reach,” Gahlaut told TOI. Monitoring walled city by drones has had its effects as people literally flee indoors if they see a drone flying over their heads.
