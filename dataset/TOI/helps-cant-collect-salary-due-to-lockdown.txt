Kolkata: Helps can’t collect salary due to lockdown
2020-05-01
KOLKATA: Last Saturday, director Subhrajit Mitra’s apartment at the Tollygunje-Karunamoyee crossing was sealed after his neighbour had tested positive for Covid-19. Ward 15 – where this Diamond City South apartment is located – is one of the containment zones in the city. Round the clock, a police van stands outside his apartment. While those providing essential services are allowed entry, the three part-time workers of the Mitra household are barred. Last month, they had turned up on the salary-day to collect their dues. But this month, there is absolutely no way that their salaries can be paid.


Mitra is among the many living in the 227 containment zones in the city, who can’t disburse salaries to their domestic helps/drivers this month. “This month, I can’t pay my cook, maid and sweeper. They are not allowed inside and do not have a smartphone where I can transfer money through Paytm. I will only be able to pay my mother’s nurse who has continued to stay with us. For the rest, I have to wait till the lockdown is lifted,” said Mitra.

It is a similar situation for the telecom executive Pradip Kumar Sen in Ahiritola. The domestic help at his residence had promised to come down once a week before ward 19 had been declared a containment zone. Sen is not sure whether she will be able to turn up to collect her salary this month. “Barricades have been put up in the entire area. There are quite a number of positive cases in the vicinity. I do not know how to pay her salary,” he said.

Residents of Teghoria in Ward 6 are also facing same problem. “Our complex, Meena Residency, is in the containment zone. Last month, I had transferred my driver’s salary online,” said Soumen Dutta, general manager of a pharma company. His domestic help stays in Madhyamgram and she borrowed her husband’s bicycle to ride all the way to Teghoria to collect her salary.
