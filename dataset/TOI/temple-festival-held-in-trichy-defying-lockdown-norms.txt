2020-03-26
TRICHY: Defying the nation-wide lockdown imposed to control the spread Covid-19, a temple festival was permitted to be conducted in Trichy city on Wednesday. At least 350 people participated in the festival held at Periya Kammala Street near Gandhi Market here.


While the city police were enforcing section 144 of CrPc restricting the movement of even the individuals venturing out to purchase essential commodities, locals of Periya Kammala Street gathered to host the temple festival of Kaliga Parameshwari temple. The temple car was positioned on the street, which was thronged by scores of people including those wearing masks. Meanwhile, the other parts of the city appeared deserted as a part of the lockdown.

The lockdown guidelines were flouted as people were seen standing next to each other at a very close distance, locals said and added that police did not restrict the huge footfall of devotees. “Hundreds of people, despite the nation-wide lockdown, are not understanding the seriousness of Covid-19 and were standing through the streets,” a resident of Gandhi Market told TOI under the condition of anonymity. However, the city police were in a denial mode. “No such incident happened in our jurisdiction,” a police officer in Fort Range said.
