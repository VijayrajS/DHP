Strict checks in containment zones even after lockdown period: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope
2020-04-04
PUNE: Health minister Rajesh Tope has said the state government would strictly enforce the surveillance norms in the “containment zone” even after the lockdown period to check the spread of coronavirus cases. 


The Centre has imposed the lockdown across the country till April 14. The standard protocols for the containment strategies involve demarcation of areas around the cluster of cases as “containment” and “buffer” zones, house-to-house search for people with respiratory symptoms and putting them under home quarantine or hospital isolation.

The minister told TOI that the government would ensure “stricter vigilance” in the containment zones/hotspots marked by the administration even after the lockdown period. 

“The surveillance measures in these areas will be stringent even after the lockdown is relaxed or withdrawn. The administration will have to maintain strict vigil on people’s movement in these areas. A curfew-like situation will continue to prevail in each containment zone till we are sure that there is no threat of Covid-19 infection,” Tope told TOI. 

Once an area is declared as a containment zone, all residents of that locality are essentially under home quarantine with restricted movements. The authorities have to ensure supply of essential commodities in these localities.

The health minister also stressed on adequate check of the over 3.5 lakh migrant workers put up at various camps across the state. “The respective district administration has been told to keep a close watch on the areas where the migrant workers are being kept. Social distancing has to be maintained among them,” he said.
