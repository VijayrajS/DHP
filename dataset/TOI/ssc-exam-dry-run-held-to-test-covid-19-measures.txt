HYDERABAD: Ahead of holding the remaining SSC exams, the Telangana school education department held a trial run at four city schools on Monday in order to assess what kind of measures can be taken at examination centres in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.


In all, 5,34,903 students had registered for the class 10 exams and 2,530 centres were identified by the director of government exams, with an average of 200 to 220 candidates per centre, to hold exams. After the HC order, the SSC exams were deferred from March 23 after conducting three exams — first language paper-1 and 2 and second language.

 

About 10-20 students were called with their writing pads to four schools — Government High School, Borabanda, New St Mary High School, Bandlaguda, BRJC Parsi High School, Secunderabad, and Government St Peter’s High School, Himayatnagar, on Monday. 

“The government has to file an affidavit in the High Court explaining preventive measures being taken at SSC centres in view of the pandemic. The trial run was conducted so that we can put forth the facts in front of the court,” Hyderabad district education officer B Venkata Narsamma said. 

As part of the trial run, students entered the examination hall wearing masks. They were given sanitiser at the entrance of the examination centre and only one student was allowed to sit on a bench in a diagonal pattern during the conduct of the trial run. 

“We will be taking all necessary measures such as sanitising the examination hall, chairs, tables and benches. Additional exam centres closer to the existing ones are being identified so that proposed norm of one student per bench can be followed,” Narsamma added.
