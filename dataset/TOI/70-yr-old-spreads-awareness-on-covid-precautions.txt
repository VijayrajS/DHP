70-year-old from Hyderabad's Boddupal spreads awareness on Covid precautions
2020-06-12
HYDERABAD: A 70-year-old resident of Boddupal has become an unlikely campaigner against ‘covidiots’ in the area. Mallajyosula Suryanarayana is calling out people without masks and those not maintaining social distancing norms.


Wearing a complete personal protection equipment (PPE) kit and armed with a loudspeaker, the septuagenarian sets out of his house every morning. “With the lockdown being eased, people have left caution to the wind. I see so many residents walking around without masks as if the coronavirus crisis does not exist,” he said.

The loudspeaker is particularly used for the wily ones — the triple-riders on bikes, whom he cannot catch, and morning walkers spotted far away. As he spells out the rulebook, a scolding here and yell there are quite common. 

Not one to backdown from a cause he believes in, he has now decided to photograph people not following precautions. “I will send these photos to the municipal authorities and cops,” Suryanarayana said, adding that positive cases in the vicinity of Sri Sainagar Colony forced him hit the streets.

The senior citizen, who said he was ‘17’ when asked about his age, said he was not vulnerable to catching the infection on one of his sorties. “I am completely prepared for action. I wear a full PPE suit. I do not touch anything or anyone and do not let people come near me. I carry my own water bottle too,” he said. Suryanarayana has now formed a ‘task force’ of four or five equally concerned people to address the matter. M Vishala, 65, said,helping out by educating women on precautions that should be taken. They are the backbone of the family.”
