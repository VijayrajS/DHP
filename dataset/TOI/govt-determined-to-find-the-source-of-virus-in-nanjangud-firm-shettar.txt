Mysuru: Industries minister Jagadish Shettar said on Friday that the government is serious in finding the source of virus at Nanjangud pharma plant and will continue to investigate it from all angles.

According to him, the government will get to the bottom of the case to find the truth. “We will find out how and who got infected first. Later everything will be revealed. The factory will not go anywhere (in the meantime),” he said.

The government’s primary focus is on bringing down the positive cases in Mysuru and to ensure that all the positive persons are treated and discharged from the Covid Hospital, he said.

When asked about reopening of the plant, he parried the question but said it will be decided at a state-level meeting. 

The minister, accompanied by district incharge minister S T Somashekar, held a meeting with various stakeholders over industrial growth in Mysuru in the wake of Covid crisis. He said the government would go slow on collection of tax from the industries if it cannot waive them off and indicated that the government will extend concession to the industries to get them back on their feet.

He said the Centre is planning to extend financial assistance to small scale industries (SSIs) and asserted that PM Narendra Modi’s leadership in fighting the pandemic has enthused the financial market, which will help it rebound fast.
