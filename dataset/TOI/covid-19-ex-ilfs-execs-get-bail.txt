2020-04-04
Mumbai: A special lockdown court on Friday granted interim bail to former IL&FS Financial Services chief Ramesh Bawa and VC of IL&FS, Hari Sankaran, who were arrested last year in a fraud case. The court granted them the relief for 75 days in light of the pandemic and said they were to surrender before the expiry of that period. 

“Considering the medical history of the patient as well as considering the prevailing situation in the country of Covid-19, the temporary bail application is allowed,” judge P R Sitre said. The court also considered their age while granting them temporary bail. The interim bail was granted on a surety of Rs 30,000 each.

The court said that they were not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission and also directed not to threaten witnesses or tamper with the prosecution evidence.
