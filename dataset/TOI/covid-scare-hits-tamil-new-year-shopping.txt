Covid scare hits Tamil New Year shopping
2020-04-14
TRICHY: The lockdown and the Covid-19 scare affected the usual shopping by residents on the eve of the Tamil New Year on Monday.

Usually, on the eve of the Tamil new year markets witness brisk sales of flowers, vegetables, fruits, and banana leaves. However, the lockdown has affected arrival of flowers to the city, which affected special pujas. “We could not find banana leaves to host a special vegetarian lunch for the deities comprising all tastes such as sour, bitter and sweet. Raw mangoes were also unavailable,” T Nagarajan, a resident of Woraiyur, said.

Most of the residents could not buy new clothes this year as all the textile showrooms in the city were closed. “Compared to previous years, this year’s Tamil new year sales were too low. It seems that the people have made up their mind to welcome the new year with what is available at their homes,” K Prabhu, a vegetable vendor from EB Road, told TOI. With the closure of temples, the Tamil new year has lost its usual sheen, said residents.
