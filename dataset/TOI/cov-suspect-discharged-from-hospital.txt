GAYA: Manpur locality youth quarantined in the isolation ward of the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH) has been released after his virological lab report was found negative. The youth, a Chinese language student, had recently returned from China which is hit by Coronavirus.

Hospital superintendent Dr Vijay Krishna Prasad also confirmed the negative nature of the test report. 

“The young man was earlier quarantined as he complained of cold, cough and fever, symptoms associated with the deadly virus. This was the second incident of a person being sent to isolation ward in the district. Earlier, a youth from Bodh Gaya, also a Chinese language student, was quarantined. He too was subsequently discharged following a negative lab report,” said ANMMCH sources.

Meanwhile, experts in hospitality sector said that tourism in Bodh Gaya has been badly hit by the Coronavirus threat. According to Arun Kumar Ojha, a Bodh Gaya-based hospitality sector expert, tourist inflow in February 2020 registered a nearly 50% decline compared to the same period in 2019. Tourist season officially ends in Bodh Gaya in the month of March.

Ojha said that several tourist groups, which had earlier booked accommodation in Bodh Gaya, have got their bookings cancelled. Bodh Gaya’s economy primarily depends on tourism.

“Tourism also witnessed a slowdown in recent years due to two terrorist attacks, prohibition and general recession. Coronavirus threat could not have come at a worse time for Bodh Gaya businessmen,” Ojha said.

Asked whether the advisory issued by several countries to its nationals cautioning them about the impact of the ongoing anti-CAA protests including the Shantibagh locality of Gaya town, Ojha said that the effect of anti-CAA protests and advisories issued by several countries is minimal. “No such advisories have been issued by Buddhist countries,” Ojha added.
