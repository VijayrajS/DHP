Bhopal: Bridging food and hunger in times of coronavirus
2020-03-25
BHOPAL: At a time when the entire country has been locked down, there are a few groups who are doing their bit to help needy fight the corona battle.


Several organisations and informal groups are coming forward to bridge food and hunger, medicines and sickness in this tough time.

Quarantine is not free time for Sikander as his day starts early morning to ensure supply of medicines and food to the needy. They receive about 50 requests on a daily basis from different locations in the city. After lockdown was declared on Sunday, volunteers now discuss their action plan on a WhatsApp group.

Volunteers help in cooking, attending calls and reaching out to maximum people. They have set up community kitchens where volunteers and cooks help preparing food. Adequate precautionary measures are being taken while serving food and medicines. 

Members of Sambhavna trust clinic are working to spread health and hygiene awareness in times of corona infection.

Measures such as arrangements for washing hands for patients before entering the clinic, distant sitting arrangements for patients, separate sittings for patients suffering cough, cold or fever. Posters are put up in the clinic to educate patients about precautions to be taken to avoid coronavirus infection along with audio assistance.

Another organisation YouthQuake — with over 100 volunteers now, is providing necessary amenities like food and medicines to under priviledged sections across the city. One of the members of YouthQuake said, “Homeless and poor are the worst hit in situation like this. With almost no alternate source of income than daily wage labour, these people often find themselves helpless. When the country is fighting together a pandemic, it becomes a collective responsibility for all of us to stand and support each other in solidarity.”
