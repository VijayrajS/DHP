2020-06-12
Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has acquired as many as 234 beds in 64 hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients even though the state government had issued a notification to take over 80% of the beds in private healthcare centres.The civic body has made it mandatory for all private hospitals and nursing homes, having 30 or more beds, to allot some beds to the NMC.“So far, all the beds have been given voluntarily by the private hospitals and nursing homes. The civic body has adequate infrastructure to deal with the current situation. Hence, we are not acquiring 80% of the beds as it may also inconvenience non-Covid patients. If the need arises, we will acquire more beds in the future,” a health department official said.The beds have been acquired by the civic body following the recent spike in the number of positive cases in the past three weeks. “Of total 234 beds acquired in 64 hospitals for Covid-19 patients, 27 are in ICUs, 12 are with ventilators and 55 are with oxygen,” the official said.“There are a total of 550 registered hospitals and nursing homes within the civic body’s jurisdiction. Of these there are 110 hospitals having over 30 beds. We are targeting these hospitals to reserve beds to treat Covid-19 patients,” he added.
