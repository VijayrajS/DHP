2020-05-06
Vadodara: East zone of the city has emerged as a major cause of concern with a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. Of the 20 new cases registered in the city, 15 were from this zone.The number of persons who died of Covid-19 touched 31 with three more deaths in the city since Monday evening. With 20 new cases, total number of patients in the city and district rose to 441.The deceased include a 55-year-old woman from Panigate area, a 62-year-old man from Nagarwada and a 40-year-old man from Wadi. While the number of positive cases reported on Tuesday may seem lower, a major reason for this was that only 137 samples from the city were tested. The SSG Hospital had tested 225 and 228 samples on Sunday and Monday when 36 and 35 persons tested positive.Sources said testing was hit by a snag in power supply at the laboratory where tests were being conducted. A power shut down had to be taken to fix the issue.Fifteen of the 20 persons who tested positive were from Wadi, Panigate, Mandvi and other areas in east zone. The cases in east and south zone have raised concern as many localities happen to be in walled city and old city areas. These areas are congested and officials said social distancing and home quarantine may be difficult to be enforced in many of the homes there.Eleven patients were also discharged in the city. These include three from SSG Hospital, one from a private hospital and seven from Covid care centre at High-Speed Railway Training Institute.
