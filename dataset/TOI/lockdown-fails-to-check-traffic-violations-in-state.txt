Lockdown fails to check traffic violations in state
2020-04-07
Vijayawada: Despite the lockdown, many are violating traffic rules across the state.

On average, police penalise 6,000 to 8,000 motorists in the state every day for traffic violations including violating prohibitory orders for the past few days.

In Vijayawada city, the police are registering at least 700 cases against motorists in a day under Motor Vehicle (MV) Act for various violations and defying the lockdown norms and collecting Rs 3.5 lakh in fines.

In Vizag city, at least 300 to 500 motorists are penalized a day for defying the lockdown norms and traffic violations. Apart from the fines, the police have been seizing at least 100 to 150 vehicles in Vizag every day.

“Some motorists are taking the lockdown very lightly and they also did not bother to follow traffic norms. When it comes to traffic violations, the highest number of motorists were penalized for not wearing helmets followed by using mobile phones while driving,” said Adinarayana, a senior traffic cop in Vizag.

“Though we have fanned out on various roads across the city and put up barricades for the enforcement of the lockdown, some motorists are finding alternative roads for roaming. Riding triple seat was one of the violations on some stretches in various parts of the state,” a senior officer said. Driving vehicles without mandatory documents was also one of the common violations, he added. “At many locations, traffic police are stopping vehicles during the lockdown. If the motorist is found to have come on the road without any valid reason, we are registering cases against them and seizing their vehicles,” said Vizag city police chief RK Meena.
