AHMEDABAD: Are you worried that your mobile phones, keys or currency notes could be carrying the Covid-19 virus after you stepped out to buy essential items during the lockdown? It would be natural for people to worry about milk pouches, groceries and other items that were handled by someone carrying the pandemic virus.

A startup has produced an ultraviolet radiation-based surface sterilizer to kill viruses and microorganisms on surfaces. The sterilizer, about nine inches long, six inches wide and six inches high, can be used in homes, offices and other establishments to sterilize items that people suspect are contaminated with the coronavirus.

Using the resources of iCreate, Prasen Vinchurkar and his team at Red Carbon TechnoHub, has produced about 100 units of the sterilizer and donated these to a number of government offices. The steriliser has a market price of Rs 1,995, but is being sold at a no-profit price of Rs 1,500 apiece.

“All one has to do is plug the sterilizer into a power connection and put in its field for ten minutes on each side. The high-energy radiation destroys the RNA and DNA of viruses and microorganisms,” explains Vinchurkar, 33, director, R&D, Red Carbon TechnoHub. He said it can be useful in the fight against Covid-19 as people still have to step out to buy essential items.

Anupam Jalote, CEO of iCreate, said, “It is a matter of pride that our team has been able to deliver fully functional products to the public just when it was most needed. The project of Vinchurkar and his team comprising of Ashish and Vijay, was funded by DST Nidhi Prayas.
