‘No decision on old VS as Covid hospital’
2020-06-13
Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not yet taken any decision to start a Covid-19 hospital at the old VS Hospital.

Standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt said that the VS is a non-Covid hospital and the general outpatient department is functioning as routine. “The AMC has not yet decided to convert VS Hospital into a Covid hospital. The city needs VS Hospital as a non-Covid hospital for general treatment,” Bhatt said.

He said that if officials from Gandhinagar and the health department direct AMC to convert the VS Hospital into a Covid hospital the AMC will immediately do so. 

He said that mayor Bijal Patel had already tweeted giving details of the OPD conducted in VS Hospital.

According to Patel’s tweet there were 1,657 fresh patients who were treated at the outpatient department and 853 patients had come again for follow-up treatment.

Even the Gujarat high court had in its order in May directed the AMC to explore the feasibility to revive the 700-bed VS Hospital at the earliest. The high court had noted in the order, “It has also been brought to our notice that the old VS Hospital, Ahmedabad, has approximately seven hundred beds. The AMC may explore the feasibility to revive the seven hundred beds at the earliest.”
