2020-03-10
Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has identified a building where it would set up a 200-bed quarantine ward for those suspected to be infected by Covid-19.

The ward is expected to be ready in the next two-three days. “People, who test positive, would be shifted to the isolation ward at Nashik Civil Hospital,” an official of NMC’s medical department said.

Moreover, the civic health department has directed all private hospitals and medical practitioners to immediately inform the civic body if any citizen visits them for with coronavirus symptoms.

The NMC has also appealed to the people to inform the health department about the people coming from abroad. “All these people are to be quarantined for 14 days,” a civic official said.

“We are taking step to prevent the spread of the virus. We have formed a Rapid Action Force team to deal with all Covid-19 issues. The mandate of the team would be to keep a tab on all those who have returned to the city from abroad with symptoms of illness and are home quarantined. It would also coordinate with other government agencies,” he added. The civic body has also warned medical shops against charging excessively for the masks.
