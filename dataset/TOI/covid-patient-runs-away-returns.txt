Ahmedabad: Fears are playing out differently in the minds of Covid-19 patients. A Covid positve patient made two dry runs, climbing a tree, before finally jumping over the boundary wall and escaping from the Covid care centre set up at the Samras Hostel on the GU campus. He did so after learning that his father was in a critical condition, and was on a ventilator.

On Tuesday evening, 30-year-old Prakash Patni, a resident of Meghaninagar, fled from the Covid care centre. He later returned on his own volition and surrendered to Gujarat University police.

An official of Gujarat University police station said, “It was revealed in primary questioning that Patni found out that his father had been put on a ventilator at SVP hospital. This instilled fear in his mind and he decided to run away from the Covid centre.”

Patni began making plans to escape on learning that another patient, Samir Ansari, had climbed a tree to escape the Covid care centre on May 28, said the official. 

Official said Patni used the same tactic to escape.

“After getting out of the Covid care centre, he did not find any transportation to go and see his father. He also had no clue as to where he ought to go. He then stayed on the footpath at Helmet Circle near the police chowky,” added the official.

When he realized that he could not go anywhere, he decided to return the Covid care centre. 

“He had a fear that his condition would deteriorate and he would be put on a ventilator like his father,” said the officer, adding that this was what led him to flee.
