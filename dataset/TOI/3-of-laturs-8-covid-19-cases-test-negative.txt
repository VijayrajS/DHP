AURANGABAD: Of the eight men from Andhra Pradesh who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on April 4 in Latur while travelling back from Haryana, three have tested negative for the virus twice on Tuesday and Wednesday.


They were undergoing treatment at the Vilasrao Deshmukh Government Medical Science Institute (VDGMSI). 

A group of 12 people, all natives of Andhra Pradesh, had travelled to Haryana’s Ferozepur for a religious event. Amid lockdown, the group hired two private vehicles and were issued emergency pass by the Haryana state government. They travelled by road via Mathura and Dhule to reach Latur’s Nilanga. However, according to the group members, the vehicle drivers refused to take them further and dropped them at Nilanga where they had taken refuge at a religious place.

On April 2, the Latur district administration picked them from the site and they were admitted to VDGMSI. Eight out of 12 had tested positive for Covid-19.

However, on Tuesday the district administration tested all eight people again, of which, four tested negative. In a retest, three of the four tested negative and the report of one is awaited.

VDGMSI dean Girish Thakur said that as per protocol, the three cases who have turned negative twice will continue to be under observation for 14 days. “After 14 days, we will test them again and if they test negative, they can be counted as recovered cases,” Thakur said.
