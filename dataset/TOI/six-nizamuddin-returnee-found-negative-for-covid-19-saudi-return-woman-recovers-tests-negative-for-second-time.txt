2020-04-09
Pilibhit: In relief of health department officials, administration and people, six locals, who were quarantined upon their return from the Nizamuddin congregation on April 5, have been tested negative for Covid-19, while the 73-year-old Saudi Arabia-return woman has also been tested negative for the second time. Chief medical officer Dr CM Chaturvedi said, “The nasal and throat swabs of the six Nizamuddin-returned suspects were sent for testing on April 6. All of them — five aged between 19 and 21 years, while one is 45-year-old — are found negative for novel coronavirus. The woman's report, issued by King George’s Medical University in Lucknow, was received here on Wednesday." Pilibhit has, so far, been reported only two positive cases — the woman and her 33-year-old son, who landed in Mumbai on March 18 after completing their 20-day-long pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. The Mumbai airport authorities had allowed them to carry out onward journey after putting stamps on their arms, requiring them to quarantine themselves in Pilibhit, but they erased the stamp and concealed their travel history from the Pilibhit administration after they reached home on March 19, said sources with the district administration. The mother and son were shifted to the isolation ward at the district government hospital on March 21 after she complained about cough and sore throat on March 20. Their blood test reports by KGMU, which was received here on March 22, confirmed them to be positive for novel coronavirus.Expressing satisfaction over her second report, DM Vaibhav Shrivastav said, “The complete recovery of the elderly woman is a matter of great relief, but we should not be overconfident about the results, as we still have a long way to go, especially with her son continues to be positive.”Dr Chaturvedi said the third report of her son would come by Thursday.
