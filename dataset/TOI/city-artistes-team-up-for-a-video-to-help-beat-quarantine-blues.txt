2020-06-04
KOLKATA: Beating the quarantine blues has not been an easy task in the wake of Covid-19. Staying emotionally healthy without letting any form of depression spiral out of control has been a challenge for many. Just before life in times of lockdown evokes ennui among people, 22 artistes have come together for the charitable initiative ‘Eka Nou Jeno’ that is supported by The Times of India. The idea is to spread the message among people that the fight against corona is to be waged by all. 

Conceived, directed and executed by Chicago-based IT management leader by profession and poet/lyricist by passion Jash Chakraborty, the ‘Eka Nou Jeno’ video features celebrities reciting lines penned by poet Utpal Chakraborty with Debopriya Chakraborty in charge of editing and the background score. The director said, “The continuous increase in Covid deaths across the world was incessantly triggering in my mind! Then I saw a poem written by my batchmate, Utpal Chakraborty. I thought it would be great if a few of my close friends, who have never recited any poem before, could recite this and spread the awareness against the pandemic. Slowly it turned into a big project.” Among the artistes who have been featured in the video are Rupam Islam, Anweshaa, Manomay Bhattacharya, Surajit Chatterjee, Raghab Chatterjee, Samik Sinha, Anik Dhar, Ujjaini Mukherjee, Arindam Chatterjee and Anindya Bose among others.

Raghab said this project is aimed at making people think positive in the face of this pandemic. Ujjaini Mukherjee is happy to be a part of this presentation. 

Singer Aneek Dhar got back to recitation after many years. It is the first time for both Anweshaa and Manomay Bhattacharya to participate in a project where they need to recite.
