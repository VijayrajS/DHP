HSRP work suspended in Vasco after Covid scare
2020-06-03
Panaji: Installation of high security registration plates (HSRP) at the Vasco-based fitment centre has been suspended after reports emerged of covid-19 positive cases in the port town. The bookings counter, housed at the Vasco regional transport office (RTO), remained shut on Tuesday.

“There were instances of crowding at the Vasco fitment centre. People are also queueing up at the RTO for driving licences and we cannot tell who is coming from where. We have, therefore, suspended HSRP operations there as a temporary measure. We will review the situation in a day and two and decide whether the decision must be deferred,” transport director Rajan Satardekar said.

The contractor appointed to execute the fitments, Real Mazon India Ltd, is now sending out messages to vehicle owners from Vasco that were scheduled for fitments this week, to standby until new dates are announced.

HSRP operations resumed from May 18 with fitment centres permitting installations at brief intervals in a bid to maintain social distancing. At the largest fitment centres at Porvorim (for Panaji registrations) and Arlem (for Margao registrations), vehicles have been coming in at a frequency of four vehicles every 30 minutes while the other centres have one vehicle coming every 20 minutes.

“We are assigning time slots for everyone. It is taking a while to complete the target,” said Kate Kayani, who is overlooking HSRP installations across the state. 

Online bookings and walk-ins, however, have gradually decreased, assistant general manager, Real Mazon India Ltd, Biswajeet Mukherjee told TOI. 

“We have been taking only minimal installations. We will start giving appointments to new ones after we clear the backlog of installations pending from before the pre-lockdown period,” he said.
