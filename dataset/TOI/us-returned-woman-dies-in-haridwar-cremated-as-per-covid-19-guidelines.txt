Haridwar: A 58-year-old woman, who had returned from the US on March 8 with her husband, died at the BHEL hospital in Haridwar on Sunday. A resident of Shivalik Nagar, she had subsequently developed symptoms of sore throat, cold and cough and on Saturday evening complained of uneasiness.

Chief medical officer Saroj Naithani told TOI that her case can at best be described as “a suspected Covid-19 case as she was not examined for it at any stage.” She added: “Her samples had not been taken for Covid-19 testing and autopsies are not conducted in such cases as per guidelines, so we are terming her as a suspect Covid-19 case. Since she was diabetic and suffered from hypertension and kidney trouble as well, the death might have taken place due to cardiac arrest.” 

The health department, however, oversaw her cremation as per guidelines laid down for Covid-19 patients; only five people were allowed to participate in the last rites. The woman's husband and their two tenants have been asked to remain quarantined in the house for the next 14 days. A list is being prepared of all those who might have come in contact with her so that they can be quarantined as well as a precautionary measure, Naithani said.

Meanwhile, in another development, Haridwar Mela Hospital chief medical superintendent Rajesh Gupta told TOI that five students (between 18 and 22 years) from a hotel management institute in Udaipur were put in the hospital's isolation ward on Sunday “on suspicion of being infected with Coronavirus.” Their blood samples were being sent for examination, he added. The students, all from Uttarakhand, had returned to the state recently after completing their course.
