PILIBHIT: After the use of Aarogya Setu application was strictly enforced in Noida and Greater Noida, another UP district became a talking point on Wednesday after the app showed two individuals who had earlier tested Covid-19 negative as "positive".

The local police, in a tizzy, managed to trace the two individuals of Pilibhit district. But, the local administration's concerns grew as one of them was detected near district magistrate's (DM) residence. Sources said DM Vaibhav Shrivastav has spoken to higher authorities in this regard.

The matter was also referred to experts of National Informatics Center, the sources said.

“The police have traced both the persons. Of them, one is a woman. The officials of health department were directed to collect their samples and sent for fresh testing,” the DM said.

“Authorities are also trying to find out whether the app alert was due to any incorrect information fed by them on their Covid related status. If so, we will have to take action,” the DM added.

Additional chief medical officer Dr CM Chaturvedi said one of the two – a male member - was admitted to a private hospital in Bareilly around 56 km from Pilibhit, on April 30 for some surgery.

On being asked as to how the Setu app showed their location within a 500m radius of the DM’s residence and a km away from the officer’s colony, the DM said the man may have left his mobile phone at his Pilibhit home.

The woman was found to be a resident of Amaria tehsil about 26 km from the district headquarters. Regarding her Pilibhit location shown by the app alert, superintendent of police Abhishek Dixit said that it was a technical glitch and would need cyber or software experts’ attention.

Notably, the Aarogya Setu is a mobile app developed by the Centre to reportedly connect health services with the people during the Covid outbreak.
