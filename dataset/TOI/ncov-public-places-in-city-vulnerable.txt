Coronavirus scare: Public places in Madurai vulnerable
2020-02-07
MADURAI: Mass transit public places in Madurai like the railway station and MGR bus stand continue to remain vulnerable to the spread of infections despite efforts taken to keep the places clean. 

However, health department officials have not issued specific instructions to the sanitary staff of the railway station and the bus stand to pay extra attention to cleanliness with respect to nCoV.

“We work several shifts on a rotational basis and keep the station clean and tidy, including platforms and toilets. We have also been provided with protective gear like masks and gloves,” said a sanitary worker.

However, with commuters openly spitting and littering and drinking water taps and basins used for washing as well, it becomes vulnerable for the spread of infectious germs. Toilets and wash basins also lack soaps or hand sanitisers.

Sources at the railway junction said so far no official instruction has been given to intensify cleanliness measures with regard to nCoV. “If an order is issued, we will comply. We have adequate water supply,” said a source. 

Meanwhile, at the MGR Bus Stand at Mattuthavani, which witnesses thousands of commuters every day, hygiene is a concern as workers try to keep the surroundings clean round-the-clock. Many spots have garbage piling up despite the presence of dustbins or have water leaking and stagnating from wash basins or drinking water taps. 

“We are continuously putting in efforts to maintain cleanliness in the bus stand. Ultimately, when it comes to the spread of infections like nCoV, it is more about an individual’s personal hygiene,” said a city corporation health official.
