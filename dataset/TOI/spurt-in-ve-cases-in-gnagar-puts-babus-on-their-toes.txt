GANDHINAGAR: There is a heightened sense of concern in the top administration after state capital Gandhinagar and its surrounding villages registered a sudden increase in Covid-19 cases. Many of those who have tested positive have come in contact with secretariat officers and staff.

After the government of India included Gandhinagar in the Covid-19 red zone on Friday, worries increased in the secretariat. The government appointed ACS rank official Rajiv Gupta as nodal officer for the state capital to fight the pandemic whose growth in the state capital can seriously affect the state’s core administration.

At present, several key sectors of Gandhinagar like Sector 8, 2, 3, 24, 7, 23 and 29 have been declared as containment areas. A majority of IAS/IPS officers live in these sectors. Over 10 adjoining villages from where vegetable is supplied to the city have also been declared as containment zones.

A senior officer said, “The government will have to take strict measures to prevent entry of any suspected Covid-19 patient into the secretariat. All staffers need to be screened on a daily basis, especially those who are coming from Ahmedabad and from Gandhinagar’s containment areas.”
