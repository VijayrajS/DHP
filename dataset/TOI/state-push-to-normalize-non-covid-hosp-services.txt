2020-04-28
KOLKATA: The state on Monday took its first steps to normalise non-Covid services in a phased manner by screening all patients at the entry points and conducting surgeries maintaining the Covid protocol. Before all planned surgeries, the patients will be tested for Covid-19. Medical teams will take protection for emergency surgeries and the patient will be removed to isolation and tested for Covid-19. 

An order issued late Monday evening state: “While there is lack of clarity on when and how the lockdown will be lifted, it is certain that we will have to normalise hospital services in a phased manner, commensurate with the evolving situation.” The order acknowledged that the patients are having a tough time visiting hospitals owing to travel restrictions and lack of transport. It urged the hospital authorities to draw up a blueprint, including duty rosters for medical personnel, to resume services.

The guidelines issued says para-medical staff in protective gear will screen all patients and segregate those who has fever. While standing in a queue, social distancing norm will be mandatory. Use of face masks will be compulsory. The hospital waiting areas will be sanitised after the OPD and visiting hours every day. In the IPD, the distance between two beds should be at least 1m. 

A health officer said, “The decisions were taken in a meeting convened by CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday.”
