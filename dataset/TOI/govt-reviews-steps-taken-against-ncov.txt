After Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh has the highest number of prominent temples, which are thronged by tens of thousands of devotees every day.

The Andhra Pradesh endowments seeking a report from prominent temple trust boards assumes significance as some of the prominent places of Hindu worship including Shri Shirdi Saibaba Sansthan in Shirdi, Siddhivinayak and Mumbadevi temples in Mumbai, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi yatra in Jammu and Kashmir, remain closed for pilgrim worship, after the respective state governments decided to prevent the outbreak of the novel virus.

Clarifying to TOI on whether the Andhra Pradesh government would take such a step, endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas said the state government has sought a report from all temple trust boards on what steps were taken by them.

‘’It is too early to say anything. I’m expecting the department to table the report by tomorrow. The state government will review the situation and take a final call’’ the minister said.
