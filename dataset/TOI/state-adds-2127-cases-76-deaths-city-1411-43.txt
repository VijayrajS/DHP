MUMBAI: Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 76 fatalities, its highest one-day Covid toll. Mumbai contributed 43 of these, also its highest single-day toll. In the last 19 days, the state has recorded 866 deaths at an average of 45 a day. The state’s overall toll now is 1,325. For the third day in a row, Maharashtra added over 2,000 new cases (2,127) and Mumbai added 1,411, its second highest daily count.

State officials attributed the jump in deaths to book-keeping and said 32 of the 76 deaths had occurred in the past 24 hours while the other 44 were from April 30 to May 16. The 43 deaths in Mumbai have taken the toll in the city to 800. Of the Mumbai deaths, 21 were from the past 24 hours, while the remaining 22 had taken place between April 30 and May 16, officials said.

Health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday admitted Mumbai was facing an acute shortage of ICU beds and called it a ‘hand-to-mouth’ situation for the country’s biggest city. But he added the situation would improve in the next few days as BMC was adding a large number of beds across categories. “We are planning to take the beds in Covid Care Centres from 60,000 to 1 lakh,” Tope said.

Tope said the state was taking 80% beds from private hospitals to augment bed capacity, and a notification to fix charges at the government rate for those 80% beds will be issued soon; for the remaining 20% beds, the hospitals can charge their rates. 

The civic body in a release said the capacity of ICU beds in the city that currently stood at 535 is being augmented to 1,000. It also said the count of beds in 38 dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH, for serious patients) has been increased to 5,030, including 3,657 in the public sector, from 1,960 beds in April. It further claimed there was strengthening of beds in dedicated corona health centres (DCHC, meant for moderately ill or co-morbid patients) too where there are 1,100 beds.

“The combined capacity of DCH and DCHC is 6,130 beds. The upcoming jumbo facilities supposed to be ready by May 31 will add to more beds with oxygen. In all, the target is to achieve 10,000 beds of DCH and DCHC,” an official said. Civic officials also confirmed that the city will be part of the sero-surveillance study to be carried out by the ICMR to gauge spread in the community. 

With 2,127 new cases, the total cases in the state are now 37,136. Tope said the high number of cases were because of large-scale testing. “We are conducting over 15,000 tests in 67 labs in the state. The numbers of cases being added are high, but rate of discharge too is going up,” he said. He also said the doubling rate of the state was almost 14 days now, and the discharge rate was 25%. 

The total cases in Mumbai are now 22,746. Fifteen deaths were reported from Thane city, 6 from Pune, 3 from Akola, 2 each from Navi Mumbai, Buldhana and Nagpur city and one each from Aurangabad, Dhule and Nashik. The deaths from Thane, 2 from Akola and one each from Buldhana, Dhule, Nagpur, Nashik and Pune were old ones, from April 30 to May 16.

Even as the state reported 6 deaths from Pune, the local administration confirmed that 8 more patients admitted to various hospitals succumbed to Covid-19 on Tuesday. All were aged 50 years and above and had co-morbidities. Over 150 tested positive in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), pushing the tally of cases there over 4,200. Around 150 patients are in critical condition, of which 43 are on ventilator support.

A total of 1,202 patients were discharged on Tuesday, the highest so far, taking the total patients to be sent back home to 9,639.
