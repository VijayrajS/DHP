Tiger tracker makes VTR his home amid lockdown

PATNA: Even as many people in jobs are working from home owing to the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic, the forest officers and guards are on their toes to prevent trespassers from entering the reserve area and keeping the animals safe.

Mahesh Mahto (35), a tiger tracker in Shaktinala team posted at Bihar’s lone tiger reserve -- Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) — has not gone home ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25. He, along with other 49 forest officials, are taking care of animals and stopping illegal movement of people to prevent poaching and possible spread of Covid-19.

Mahto said on Monday that sighting of tigers in reserve area has increased because of no tourists nowadays. “We keep a track on the movement of tigers and other wild animals and their health. If anything goes wrong with any animal, we inform the range officer. VTR is home to a large number of wild animals, such as tigers, leopard and chital among others. Guarding them from poachers is our duty,” he said.

“We get dry ration from the state government once a week. We cook ourselves and do our duty for more than eight hours per day and sleep in control room,” he added.

With weak or no mobile phone network in the dense forests, internet and all kinds of entertainment are ruled out for these forest staff.

Mahto said his wife Sona Devi and three kids -- Dharmendra (14), Sanu Kumari (8) and Dhanu Kumari (6) — are at home. “Most of the time, there is no network connectivity and it is impossible to make a video call. I talk to them over phone, when I go to the hilly areas. The villagers in my native place in Harnatar are very cooperative. I assure them that I would be back as soon as the lockdown is lifted,” he said.

“Staying here in VTR is safe rather than going home and coming back again. In this way, I won’t get infected,” Mahto said.
