“Five samples, including those of four tenants and a relative of Harjit Singh (67) of Ambala Cantonment, who died due to coronavirus infection on Wednesday at PGIMER in Chandigarh, have tested negative,” he said.

The health authorities on Friday also sent samples of the deceased’s son, wife and daughter-in-law for examination to PGIMS, Rohtak and their reports are expected on Saturday.

Meanwhile, samples of three persons, who attended a religious congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi, were also sent on Friday for examination. “These persons are asymptomatic but we have sent samples as a precautionary measure,” the civil surgeon said.

He further said the seventh sample sent for examination on Friday is that of a coronavirus symptomatic man, a resident of Ambala Cantonment.
