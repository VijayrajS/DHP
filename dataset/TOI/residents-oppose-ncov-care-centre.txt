2020-05-16
PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Residents of housing societies located close to Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) Covid-19 care centre at Balewadi sports complex have started a petition to move the facility elsewhere. However, the civic administration has dismissed the fears of the Mhalunge residents as baseless and unscientific. 


Chandrakant Marathe, chairman of Kirti Elegant committee, said, “There are four to five housing societies sharing a common boundary with the Balewadi sports complex, where a hostel has been turned into PCMC’s institutional quarantine facility. We have seen an increase in the movement of people and vehicles on the road connecting to the complex. We demand that the gate near our housing societies be closed and the one located on the highway be used to access the quarantine facility.”

Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar in a text message told TOI, “We are taking all necessary precautions to make sure that the patients, who have tested positive, are contained within the building. The area will be cordoned off and disinfection process will be ensured on regular basis.”
