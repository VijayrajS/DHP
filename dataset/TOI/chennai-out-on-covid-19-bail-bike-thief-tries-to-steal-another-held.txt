CHENNAI: A 24-year-oldman who was released from Puzhal prison last week in view of the Covid-19 pandemic is back in judicial cusody after being arrested for stealing a bike at Thiruvanmiyur on Friday.


Police said R Gajendran, a Sri Lankan refugee who stayed briefly at a camp in Tiruvannamalai district, was among the 3,934 remand prisoners released from various jails. He offered horse rides to people on the Marina Beach and slept there.

Police said Gajendran started stealing parked bikes to meet his expenses. The Taramani police had arrested him for stealing bikes and a court sent him to Puzhal prison last month. However, he was released on March 26 as part of the measures taken by the prison authorities to reduce the risk of inmates getting Covid-19 infection.

Gajendran who did not have any money decided to steal again, said police. On Friday night, when he was stealing a two-wheeler from Thiruvanmiyur MRTS station parking lot a security guard saw him and raised an alarm. However, Gajendran managed to escape. The guard alerted railway police and a case was registered at the Tiruvanmiyur railway police station.

Police on patrol intercepted Gajendran at Chepauk and the vehicle was impounded. Investigation showed he was riding a stolen bike. He was handed over to the Tiruvanmiyur railway police and a court sent him to jail.
