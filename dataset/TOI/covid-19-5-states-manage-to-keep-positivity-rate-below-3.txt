2020-06-15
NEW DELHI: Five states — MP, Rajasthan, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab — and the Union territory of Chandigarh have managed to slow the incidence of Covid-19 cases with the positivity rate (confirmed cases per 100 tests) over the last three 14-day periods showing a downward trend. 


All the states have kept the positivity rate in the green zone, below 3%, while Chandigarh has remained at 5% through the three fortnights.


States that maintain a positivity rate below 5% over a period of two weeks are considered to be ready for easing of lockdown measures. In the last fortnight, MP’s positivity rate came down from 5% to 3% while Rajasthan’s remained constant at around 2%. In the last three fortnights, Kerala’s positivity rate came down to 1.69% (during May 31-June 13 period) from 2% during May 19-June 1.

The positivity rate in Himachal Pradesh has remained at 1% during the last two fortnights and below 1% in Punjab, a major achievement for the two states in containing the spread of the pandemic. Only Chandigarh has been constantly hovering around 5% in all three periods studied. For India, the positivity rate has gone up from 5% (during May 7-21) to 6.4% (May 19-Jun 1) to 7.4% (May 31-Jun 13), the three two-week periods analysed by TOI.
