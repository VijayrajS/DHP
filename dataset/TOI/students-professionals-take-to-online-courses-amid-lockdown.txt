2020-05-04
HYDERABAD: Graduates and professionals from the city are increasingly opting for remote learning and upskilling courses during the extended lockdown as e-learning websites have seen elevated traffic.


UXReactor Inc, a California-based design consulting firm with its presence in Hyderabad, has seen a significant rise in its open training platform. “With the Covid-19 outbreak, we are seeing a decent rise of about 150% in traffic every week, as more people are looking for opportunities to upskill and reskill,” Prasad Kantamneni, co-founder of UXReactor told TOI.

The company has also started a reading group on the world-renowned professional network Linkedin, with the hashtag #uxreactorcampusoutreach. 

Ramping up the digital education platform, city-based YuppTV has launched an ed-tech platform called ‘YuppMaster’. “In the light of Covid-19 lockdown, the edtech platform is currently offering free education to all IIT-JEE/NEET aspirants in 12th grade. YuppMaster’s individual courses involve three to six hours of live classes every day, in which students are able to clear their doubts in real-time via live chat,” said Uday Reddy, CEO and founder of YuppTV & YuppMaster. 

To increase student engagement, Adda247 has launched a 21-day challenge for community activities in the form of free mock tests. The platform is also providing test preparation courses at an affordable price. “We are trying to empower our learning user base, which also comprises less affluent students with limited economic means,” said Anil Nagar, CEO and Founder of Adda247.
