Agra: 80 health workers including 30 resident doctors of Agra’s Government Medical College have been quarantined after four frontline staffers tested positive for Covid-19. The head of the gynaecology department was also among those isolated. It comes a day after it was found that two patients, who were admitted in general wards, had died and later tested positive for the contagious disease.Sources inside the hospital said that these measures were not enough as hundreds of other health workers and patients may have come in contact with the four staffers. “There are chances that scores of health workers and patients have contracted the disease from the four infected workers,” a staff said on condition of anonymity.It all started on April 7 when two resident doctors were tested positive for novel coronavirus.After seeing spike in the number of infected health workers at the government medical college, chief medical officer (CMO) Mukesh Vats shot off a letter to the principal of hospital directing him to take all precautionary measures while admitting patients in the general wards.A senior doctor, on condition of anonymity, told TOI, “For the last 15 days, we had been pestering the authorities to follow proper strategy to protect frontline workers and doctors. But no one was prepared to listen to us.”“In the absence of adequate supply of personal protection kits in general wards, N-95 masks and gloves, particularly in the general wards, most health workers are exposed to the deadly virus,” he added. A source said that ward boys usually sit together, no matter where they are deputed. “If this is not stopped, the entire hospital staff may need to be quarantined one day,” he said.
