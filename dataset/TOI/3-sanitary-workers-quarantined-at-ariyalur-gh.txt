Trichy: The health department has quarantined three sanitary workers at Ariyalur Government Hospital for having close contact with a Covid-19 positive patient being treated at the hospital. Authorities have also initiated disciplinary action against one of the three sanitary workers for recording a video on the patient’s mobile phone.

Health department officials said that a 25-year-old woman in the isolation ward of Ariyalur GH recently tested positive for Covid-19. Before the test results arrived, three sanitary workers including a male worker and two female workers were said to have had close contact with the ailing patient.

The officials said that the male sanitary worker had used the mobile phone of the Covid-19 positive patient to record a video reportedly to share in a social media platform. As the incident was disclosed to the management after the patient testing positive for Covid-19, the three sanitary workers were kept under watch in the isolation ward of the Ariyalur GH.

“The three workers will be constantly monitored for the next 14 days. On displaying any of the symptoms, we will collect their swabs for Covid-19 laboratory test,” a senior official with the health department said. The other employees of the Ariyalur GH including the non-medical staffs were told to be cautious while working in the Covid-19 isolation ward.
