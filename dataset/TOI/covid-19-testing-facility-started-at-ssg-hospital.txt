2020-03-24
Vadodara: The state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara will itself test samples of patients who are admitted in the hospital with suspicion of coronavirus or are treated as COVID-19 suspects.Earlier, samples of such patients were sent to Ahmedabad’s B J Medical College and Civil Hospital.“The state government has given us the permission to start the testing facility at Vadodara itself. It will be done at SSG Hospital from now onwards,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal, who had moved the proposal before the state government two days back.“We have already started testing of samples from Monday morning. Earlier, reports of samples which were sent to Ahmedabad used to arrive in 48 hours. Now, we will get them in couple of hours, helping us in speedy diagnosis,” said Dr Rajeev Daveshwar, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital. On the first day, around six samples of patients were tested at the new facility.
