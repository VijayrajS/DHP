Covid test in an hour at Balrampur hosp
2020-06-09
Lucknow: Testing for novel coronavirus infection, which currently takes over 24 hours, will now be done in just 60 minutes with the India made TrueNAT testing machine. Early test results will help in expediting the treatment process of both the Covid and non-Covid patients.

While KGMU is already using the machine for sample testing, Balrampur hospital is the first district hospital to get the machine. The hospital will start testing samples on it from Tuesday. “We have done some technical trials of the machine and will begin using it for sample testing from Tuesday,” said Balrampur hospital chief medical superintendent (CMS) DrRK Gupta.

Until now samples collected at Balrampur hospital of suspected Covid-19 patients were sent to KGMU for testing and the report would take around 24 hours to come because of the sample load at KGMU. “It is a PCR testing machine which uses a number of processes to separate the RNA which is then read for delivering a test report,” he added.

The machine was approved by ICMR in May for testing of novel coronavirus sample. It is an Indian diagnostic testing machine which was made for detecting drug resistant tuberculosis.

“The machine has an advantage of giving results in just about 60 minutes. It is an indigenous machine and should be promoted. We have been using it for TB sample testing and now for Covid-19. If the machine has a confirmatory chip in it, samples will not have to be sent to KGMU for reconfirmation,” said KGMU microbiology head Prof Amita Jain.

“We are getting TrueNat machines installed at various district hospitals and medical college so that the duration taken in sample testing reduces drastically and treatment can begin accordingly,” said medical education director, Dr KK Gupta.
