2020-04-25
GUNTUR: Tension prevailed at a burial ground in Guntur when people pelted stones at the ambulance in which a Covid-19 victim was brought for cremation.


The locals insisted that Covid-19 victims should not be cremated in their area. The incident took place at Gujjanagundla Hindu burial ground late on Friday. According to information, a 23-year old pregnant woman of Nakirekallu village near Narasaraopet died of Covid-19 at NRI Hospital (dedicated Covid hospital) near Mangalagiri on Thursday.

Although the local officials should have performed the final rites of the victim there itself, they shifted the body to the mortuary at Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur late on Thursday night.

District collector Samuel Anand Kumar directed Guntur tehsildar to complete the final rites in Gujjanagundla burial ground where an LPG crematorium is available. Recently, another Covid-19 victim was cremated in the same area. The police who escorted the ambulance tried to pacify the locals but they failed to control the situation as the locals pelted stones at the ambulance and raised slogans against the officials.

Sensing trouble, the police rushed additional forces to the area and brought the situation under control by canning the agitators. The cremation was completed with full police security.
