Coronavirus drowns Holi celebration in textile markets
2020-03-06
SURAT: Unlike every year, this time around there will be no splash of colours, distribution of sweets and cultural programmes in textile wholesale hub in the city because majority of textile markets have decided to cancel ‘Holi milan’ events spooked by coronavirus. Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA) has announced that all the textile markets will remain shut on Holi on March 10. 


It has been an old tradition in the textile markets located on Ring Road, Salabatpura and Sahara Darwaja to celebrate the festival of colours six days in advance. This will be first time that the textile traders won’t be celebrating the Holi festival. 

 
 
Every year, textile traders invite musical and cultural troupes of artists from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for Fagun celebrations in the textile markets. Every textile market organizes Holi milan events where family and friends of traders are invited. 

Rajnish Lilah, a textile trader at JJ Textile Market, said, “It is risky because of coronavirus to gather for mass celebration of Holi in the markets. We support the decision of the market management to not celebrate the festival.”

NTM Textile Market president Jagdish Goyal said, “The deadly virus is spreading fast across the globe and we have had a few cases in India too. We are following health advisory of central government to avoid mass gathering and celebrations. This will be first time that the markets won’t witness Holi festival.”

FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal told TOI, “Holi is celebrated on a much larger scale in textile markets. 

But, this time the traders won’t be celebrating the festival to avoid mass gathering and protect themselves from coronavirus.”
