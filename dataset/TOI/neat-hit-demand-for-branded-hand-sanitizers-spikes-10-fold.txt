AHMEDABAD: Following the advisory issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare to curb and prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, the demand for hand-sanitizers has risen 10-fold. Consequently, there’s a shortage of branded sanitizers and alcohol-based hand rubs on the shelves.

According to estimates by Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association (FGSCDA) against 10,000 units sold on a daily basis across Gujarat, the current demand is as high as 1 lakh units a day.

When TOI independently checked with four chemists in different parts of Ahmedabad, none had branded hand-sanitizers available. “We just have a single brand of sanitizers. We used to keep other brands, but supplies are low as the stock is limited,” said the manager of a chain of medical stores near Panjrapole Crossroads.

Yet another medical store owner in Prahladnagar claimed he had run out of stock completely. “People are asking for alcohol-based hand-rubs that have 60% or more alcohol content and those are not easily available. We have completely exhausted stocks and have placed order for sanitizers, but are not sure when they will be available,” said Manish Patel, a chemist.

Industry sources also said that amid short supply and high demand, hand sanitizers are being sold in the black maret at high rates.

“We have issued an advisory to all our members to not hoard stocks of hand sanitizers and masks which are currently in high demand, just to sell them at a higher price,” said Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA.

A similar advisory was also issued by Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA).
