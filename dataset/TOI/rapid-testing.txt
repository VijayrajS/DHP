Rapid testing

Kolkata: After the ICMR nod to allow rapid testing for areas reporting clusters, large migration gathering and hotspots, the Bengal government has already started identifying such zones. “Once such areas are identified, the government will take a call on the need for rapid testing. But discussions are on,” said a state health government official said on Sunday.

There are at least 30 NABL accredited labs in Kolkata that have the facility for rapid testing. “We had started enquiring about the kits so that we can procure it as soon as we get the go ahead from the state government,” said an official of a private lab.

But even before the guideline came up, some private laboratories in the city had started with its ground work on procuring the testing kits.

A rapid test can detect if a person has coronavirus through a prick on the finger in just about 30 minutes. 

As the number of Covid-19 positive cases keeps surging, health experts have been talking about the need for testing more in order to contain the spread of the virus. Now, with ICMR issuing guideline of rapid antibody testing, doctors said it would help in faster identifying of the infected.

According to the latest ICMR advisory, rapid antibody testing would be undertaken in all areas reporting clusters of Covid-19 positive cases.

“Rapid testing is a screening test. So, all positive cases have to be re-confirmed by RT-PCR testing through swab samples of a person,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury, microbiologist at Peerless Hospital. “Since rapid test takes about 20 minutes to give result, it will help scale up number of tests, where only the positive cases will require reconfirmation. In addition to saving time, it will also help in saving a lot of resources, including testing kits for swab samples,” added Chaudhury.

So far, all five government laboratories are testing swab samples through RT-PCR method. Two private labs that will start functioning from Monday, too, will be using this method of testing. “There is a need for testing more samples. In such a case, rapid testing is an option. But there are kits for RT-PCR that is less costlier and gives result in four hours,” said Sumon Poddar, a microbiologist at Institute of Child health. While testing swab samples can take six to eight hours and a kit costs about Rs 4,500, rapid testing costs just about one fourth.
