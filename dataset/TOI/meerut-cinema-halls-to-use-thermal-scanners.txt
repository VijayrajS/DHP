2020-03-16
MEERUT: The district health department has issued a novel coronavirus advisory stating that cinema halls should check people coming in for fever using thermal scanners and stop their entry in case they are detected with fever. Instructions have also been given to sanitise chairs after every show so that the chances for the spread of infection are minimised.

“All the theatres have been asked to make provision of thermal scanners and check the body temperature of those coming to watch movies. In case anybody is detected with fever, that person should not be allowed entry to the cinema hall. This is being done to contain any infection which a local resident might be carrying and might end up infecting some other person,” said Meerut chief medical officer Dr Raj Kumar.

So far Meerut has sent nine samples for test, all of which have tested negative. The isolation wards set up in the city at government hospitals have been kept ready for any suspected case that might be reported.

“City residents should try and avoid going to any public events and programmes, unless very necessary. Not just this, travels – unless unavoidable – should be postponed. Travelling in public transports should also be avoided,” said Dr Kumar.

The health officials further said the people should understand that masks are to be worn only by those who have cough or cold to prevent anybody else catching the infection. Healthy people need not wear masks, doctors said.
