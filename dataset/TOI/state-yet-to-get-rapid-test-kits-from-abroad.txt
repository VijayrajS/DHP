Covid-19: Kerala yet to get rapid test kits from abroad
2020-04-13
KOCHI: The state health department has come out with guidelines for rapid testing, even as they wait for the one lakh rapid test kits from China and Korea.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had announced on March 28 that the state will go in for rapid testing to help gauge more quickly and effectively the extent of the virus’s spread within threatened communities. However, with no kits available in the state, the tests are yet to start.

The state government that had at first placed orders with companies in China and Korea are now looking at other global manufacturers to import the kits. “We want to be prepared and ensure that we don’t lose time once the rapid test kits arrive in the state,” said principal health secretary Dr Rajan N Khobragade.

There is a huge demand for rapid test kits from across the globe. Firms in India, including Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in Thiruvananthapuram, are working to develop prototypes of low-cost rapid test kits. “It is all in the experimentation phase in India and have not yet been launched commercially,” added Dr Khobragade.

However, delay in starting community tests is a concern for health authorities here. “To know the actual situation of Covid-19 spread in the state, we need to immediately concentrate on identifying community transmission of the coronavirus and herd immunity in the population. There is immense pressure from every district to start rapid tests,” said Dr K P Aravindan, member of Kerala government's medical advisory panel on Covid management.

“Countries that have succeeded to control infection had opted for rapid testing. If we don’t increase our testing, we may develop a false sense of security and that would prove to be detrimental,” said IMA Hospital Board of India chairman Dr Jayakrishnan A V.
