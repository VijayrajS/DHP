Coronavirus scare in Delhi: Services at RTOs to be curtailed
2020-03-20
NEW DELHI: To stop the spread of infection by the novel coronavirus by reducing crowding, many services at the 13 Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in Delhi are likely to be suspended or curtailed soon. The transport department is planning to stop issuing learner’s licences and also reduce the number of appointments being given out per day.


“In the meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, which was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other senior ministers and officials, it was decided that all Delhi government work will be segregated into two categories, essential and non-essential,” said an official. “All non-essential activities are likely to be suspended, which includes learner’s licences,” he said.

More than four lakh learner’s licences are issued by the transport department every year and more than half of the applicants are in the age group of 18 to 24. The tests also include touching biometric scans and online tests on touchscreen computers, which might get contaminated.

“It is very likely that issuance of learners licences would be deferred as it is very difficult to sanitise keyboards, mouse and touchscreens after each applicant takes their test. That is why it is better to defer this for a few weeks,” said a Delhi government official. “A decision is likely very soon.”

The official added that the number of appointments at RTOs may also be curtailed to avoid crowding.

“In spite of the outbreak of the global pandemic, there has been only a dip of about 10% in number of applicants coming to RTOs. As the schedules for driving tests, license renewals or registration certificate transfer etc. are made in advance and paid for, applicants don’t want to miss their appointments,” said an official of a busy RTO. “We are also apprehensive for our own health.”
