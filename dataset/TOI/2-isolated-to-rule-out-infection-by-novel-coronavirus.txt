PUNE: Two more travellers, who returned from China recently, were isolated at the civic-run Naidu hospital - on Saturday and Sunday respectively - to rule out the novel coronavirus infection after they complained of minor cold, cough and fever. 

"One of them is a 42-year-old man whom we isolated around 9pm on Saturday (February 1). He has a cough, sore throat and was in Shanghai in China between January15 and 18," said medical expert Ramchandra Hankare, chief of the health department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

"The other traveller, a 27-year-old man, was in Shanghai between January 5 and 25. We isolated him around 1.15pm on Sunday (February 2). He has a fever, sore throat and cough," Hankare said.

Eight travellers, till date, have undergone care at the Naidu hospital's isolation ward over the last two weeks after they presented with some of the symptoms on their return from China. 

"Of them, five travellers tested negative. We have discharged four of them. Four travellers, including the two new patients, are currently undergoing care at the isolation ward at Naidu hospital. We have sent their throat swab samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for testing. The reports are awaited," Hankare said.

A total of 5,128 passengers returning from China and other affected countries have so far been screened at the Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) since January 18. 

38 travellers - residents of Pune, Mumbai, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Kalyan, Vasai, Virar, Nanded and other parts of Maharashtra, will be under surveillance for 28 days.

Of the 38 travellers, 17 travellers had complained of minor presentations of cold, cough, fever and headache, following which they were quarantined mainly in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded and Nagpur. The remaining patients have not developed any illness and hence have not been isolated.
