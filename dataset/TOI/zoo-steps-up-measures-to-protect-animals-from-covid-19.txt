Kanpur: After four tigers and three lions tested positive at the Bronx Zoo in New York, the Kanpur zoo authorities have stepped up measures to protect big cats from the virus.

 Kanpur zoo is home to nine tigers, five lions and more than 20 leopards, five jungle cats and one leopard cat. 

Talking to TOI, senior zoo vet, Dr RK Singh said, “We have already taken all precautions to save animals from coronavirus.”

“The vets are spending very little time with tigers, lions and leopards to keep animals safe from any human. We are also keeping watch on the animals with CCTV cameras. Only in case of an emergency, we go close to lions, tigers and leopards.”

Also, keepers have been instructed to maintain minimal contact with the felids. It is also being ensured that the keepers wear proper protective gear, he further said.

Dr Singh further said that the number of staff visiting the zoo on official duty has also been reduced to minimise the risk of man to man and man to animal contact. He said isolation cages had already been readied to isolate an animal in case it falls prey to any contagious disease.

“At the entry gate of the zoo, first the staff is sanitized and then their vehicles are made to take mist bath containing sodium hypochlorite to ensure complete sanitization. We are providing immuno-modulators to all big cats in order to improve their immunity”, the zoo vet further said.

Apart from big cats, the zoo vets and staff are also taking extra care of other wild animals such as rhino, hippo, zebra and deer.
