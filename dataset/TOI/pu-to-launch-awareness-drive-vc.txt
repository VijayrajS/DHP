2020-03-20
PATNA: Patna University (PU) decided to launch an awareness drive against coronavirus (Covid-19) on Thursday by educating people about ways to prevent the disease and maintain proper hygiene. The decision was taken at a meeting of the National Service Scheme (NSS) programme officers held under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh.


“Big hoardings and banners depicting precautionary measures against the spread of coronavirus will be put up in every college. Hand-washes and sanitizers will also be distributed among PU teachers and employees as well as the people residing in the neighbouring localities,” the VC told this newspaper.

The PU central dispensary has started manufacturing sanitizers and is trying to set up an isolation ward for the Covid-19 suspects. “All the medical officers working at the dispensary are keeping a watch on the university staff. Almost all students residing in different PU hostels have already left the campus,” Singh said.

He added, “Regular sanitization of all staircases and furniture will be done. Besides, all colleges, institutes and postgraduate departments of PU will keep their washrooms clean and make soaps and hand sanitizers available for the staff.”

PU NSS programme coordinator Atul Aditya Pandey said orders for preparation of hoardings and banners had already been issued and they would be displayed in a day or two.
