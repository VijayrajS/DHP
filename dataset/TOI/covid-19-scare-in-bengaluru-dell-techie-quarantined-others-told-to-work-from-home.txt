Preventive measures

“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees and communities where we operate. Two employees of Dell India were tested for Covid-19 following their return from the US — including a visit to our headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. One employee tested negative, while another tested positive and has since been placed in quarantine. We continue to take measures to protect Dell Technologies team members and communities by following the health and safety guidelines from World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control, and coordinating with local health officials,” the company said in a statement.

Ohrie also said other employees in the facility where the affected employee is working have been asked to work from home till March
