2020-03-18
PUNE: State-run Sassoon General Hospital has got approval to set up 40-bed intensive care unit (ICU) dedicated to coronavirus-infected patients showing severe symptoms. 

The new facility, which is expected to be ready in a week, is being readied on the seventh floor of the new 11-storey building of the hospital. 

“We have received Rs 5 crore from the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) to set up an independent and dedicated ICU facility only for Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms. So far, none of the infected patients are exhibiting any serious symptoms in Pune,” spine surgeon Ajay Chandanwale, dean of the state-run BJ Medical College attached Sassoon hospital, said.

DPDC, created in all districts, makes recommendations, projection of local needs and fixing priority within the objectives of state/national plan.

Chandanwale said, “To make the 40-bed ICU facility, we need 32 ventilators. We have already submitted our requirements. If everything goes as per the plan, the new ICU facility will be ready within a week. We have the requisite trained personnel to run it. We can mobilise resources during public health emergencies like this. The two elevators of the hospital have already been made operational in our new building.” 

Currently, a three-bed ICU is functional at Naidu hospital, which is the only designated isolation facility in the city.
