Covid-19 safeguards in place for Intermediate spot valuation
2020-03-19
Vijayawada: Amidst the growing fears around the spread of coronavirus, the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) has suggested implementing precautionary measures for spot valuation camps across the state. The Intermediate examinations, which began on March 4, concluded on Wednesday. The evaluation camps will begin on Thursday. The suggestions were made in view of the fact that evaluators have to handle lakhs of answer sheets at the camps.

The BIE instructed camp officers to maintain a distance of one metre between two examiners and to ensure that spot valuation halls are not congested. All examiners have been advised to wear masks. Other suggestions include maintaining proper ventilation at the valuation halls besides providing water and sufficient quantity of liquid soap to evaluators. 

All valuation halls will be cleaned and disinfected every day. First-aid boxes and medical personnel will also be available at the camps. Persons with fever, cough and cold will be replaced with a substitute immediately and referred to a nearby facility. Information, education and communication material such as posters regarding coronavirus will be on display at all camps.

Around 10.65 lakh students appeared for the Intermediate examinations in Andhra Pradesh this year. The exams were held at 1,411 examination centres across the state.
