Madurai: A 42-year-old Covid-19 patient from Mandapam and two others were booked by Ramanathapuram district police on Saturday for recording and sharing a hate audio clip as well as false information on the viral disease in the last two days. 

The man is undergoing treatment at the Sivaganga government medical collegeand hospital (SMCH). The trio was booked under various sections of IPC including 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule). They were also booked under section 67 of IT Act for sharing the audio in the social media. However no arrests were made till Saturday evening.

The man from Mandapam was among those who attended the religious conference in Delhi and was under home quarantine since March 24. "The audio was recorded when he was shifted from the Ramanathapuram GH to SMCH by road as per the standard protocol after he tested positive on April 16," Ramanathapuram district SP R V Varun Kumar said.

In the three-minute audio, the man is heard accusing a group of working against them and spreading rumours as part of a big conspiracy. "I tested negative twice and am now harassed. Do I sound like an (COVID-19) affected person? I am healthy," says the man to his friend Raja.

He further adds that the government is trying to win brownie points by projecting a big number of affected persons and then claiming that everyone has been cured. "Tell everyone. Let them know that all this is fake," says the man.

"The audio recorded by Raja was circulated in the social media by Abdullah with intent to create unrest by depicting that people from a religion are targeted. The Covid-19 patient is trying to mislead people and trying to build a false impression on the deadly infection," Varun Kumar told TOI. A case was registered by the police based on a complaint lodged by Ramanathapuram town inspector A Jeevarathinam.
