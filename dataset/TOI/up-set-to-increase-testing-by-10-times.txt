At the moment, SGPGI has the capacity to test 400 samples in a day. “Soon, we will be able to conduct 1,000 tests,” said Prof Dhiman.

SGPGI is also running a 24X7 telemedicine facility for medical colleges and government hospitals. “We are playing the role of big brother. Our team is running a 24X7 telemedicine helpline to attend dilemma of health professionals. In addition to this, we are also present on digital platforms such as WhatsApp and zoom as well,” said Dhiman.

The institute is also training health personnel in handling Covid-19 patients, their treatment and the strict protocols to be followed, he said.
