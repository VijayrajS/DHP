DEHRADUN: As many as 89 police personnel have been quarantined in Uttarakhand since the outbreak of Covid-19 for coming in contact with either coronavirus-positive persons or their contacts. A total of 27 cops had gone in self-quarantine in Udham Singh Nagar district in March. Of these, 19 cops were quarantined after they intercepted members of Tablighi Jamaat while entering Uttarakhand and later four of those Jamaatis tested Covid-19 positive.


The most number of cops, 22, have been quarantined in Haridwar, followed by Nainital and Champawat, where 11 cops have been put in isolation each. However, in Dehradun, only one policeman has been put in quarantine. 

Speaking to TOI, Ashok Kumar, director general (DG) law and order said, “The Uttarakhand Police force is fighting on the frontline of the Covid-19 battle by putting themselves in risk. For coming in touch with coronavirus-positive cases or their contacts while performing their duties, 89 police personnel have been quarantined till date in the state.” “As of Wednesday, many of the 89 quarantined cops have resumed their duties after completing the quarantine period, while the rest of them will be joining as soon after they end their quarantine period,” said a senior police official.

Notably, 6,000 police personnel and an additional 20 companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) have been pressed into service in Uttarakhand in the fight to contain the spread of coronavirus in the hill state. For effective implementation of the lockdown, the state has been divided into 102 zones and 500 sectors by the state police.
