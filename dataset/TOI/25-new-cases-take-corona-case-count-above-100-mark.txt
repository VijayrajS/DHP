LUCKNOW: In a disquieting development, the number of novel coronavirus cases in the state capital crossed the 100 mark on Thursday with 25 more people from the two hotspots in city — Sadar and Nayagaon — testing positive for the infection.


The sudden spurt in the cases since last two days sent alarm bells ringing, the only consolation was the fact that the infection has not spread to other areas and the fresh cases are confined to the two hotspots. 

Among the 25 positive cases detected on Thursday, 22 are from Sadar and three from Nayagaon in Nazirabad.

The 24-year-old son of the elderly man from Nazirabad who died of Covid-19 on Wednesday also tested positive, besides eight of a family, including women and children, in Sadar.

All fresh cases are symptomatic and have been admitted to RR Insitute on Sitapur Road and government hospital in Bakshi Ka Talab, said Lucknow chief medical officer Dr Narendra Agarwal.

It was the second day when the city recorded fresh cases in double digits, after 31 people had tested positive on Wednesday.

Total 107 people have tested positive in Lucknow so far, including 84 residents and 23 hailing from other cities and states. Of total city residents, 73 got infected after coming in contact with Tablighi Jamaat members who had taken shelter in their areas. In fact, 64 people have been found to be infected in Sadar area alone, which is now among the biggest hotspots in the state.

However, most of them are still asymptomatic.

The health department had also sent swab samples of the 25 employees deployed on duty in Sadar for testing but their reports were negative.

The people found positive in the city till now are undergoing treatment at KGMU and other hospitals.
