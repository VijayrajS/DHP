Admin quells rumours about relaxation in lockdown norms
2020-05-29
Nashik: A new message on social media announcing further relaxations in lockdown norms and allowing salons, tea stalls and even gymnasiums to operate has forced the district administration to intervene a second time and clarify that the rules and regulations announced on May 17 are still in force. The message going viral on social media claims that from now on, the curfew would be in place from 7am to 5pm (instead of 7pm). As against the old notification which states that salons are to remain closed till further orders, the new message claims salons can open and that customers will have to make prior appointments. In addition, the new message also says that physical exercise in gyms and grounds was allowed provided people maintained social distancing (actually prohibited). It also mentions allowing tea and paan stalls to operate and having a maximum of 50 people for a wedding programme, both of which are completely banned as per the old notification. The message further claimed that the district collector had allowed three and four-wheelers to ferry passengers—a claim that has no substance as public transportation services have been banned in both Nashik and Malegaon city, both of which come under red zones. District collector Suraj Mandhare said no such relaxations had been granted apart from the ones clearly defined in the notifications issued from time to time. “Public transportation remains suspended. Shops and establishments where people are likely to come in close contact with each other will not operate as long as the state government does not issue any guidelines,” he said. Asked if a complaint was going to be registered against the ones spreading the message, Mandhare said the message did not carry the name of any district, collector or even government official and hence no case would be registered.
