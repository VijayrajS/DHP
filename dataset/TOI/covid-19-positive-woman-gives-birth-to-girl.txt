Aurangabad: A woman who has tested positive for Covid-19 has delivered a baby girl at the district civil hospital here at 12.40 pm on Saturday, and the infant has been moved to the post-operative room.

All eyes are on the baby whose swab samples have been sent for testing, although internationally there has been no known case of any baby getting the infection through mother. 

The team of doctors at district civil hospital, including gynecologist Kamlakar Mudkhedkar, Kavita Jadhav, anaesthesiologist PM Kulkarni, pediatrician Bharti Nagare conducted a C-section on the woman, and the baby weighed 3.1kg. 

District civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni said that the three swabs of the newborn were collected in the operation theatre for Covid-19 analysis. 

“The baby cried well after the delivery. The mother and newborn are fine and their vital stats are stable. The baby has been shifted to post-operative room,” paediatrician Santosh Naikwade said on behalf of the district civil surgeon. 

The district administration learned that the woman, along with her husband and stepson, entered Aurangabad district in an ambulance on April 10. They were staying at their relative’s place in Baijipura.

On April 13, the woman’s 17-year-old stepson was taken to district civil hospital with coronavirus symptoms. He tested positive on April 14. Two days later, the woman too tested positive.

According to civic health officer Nita Padalkar, the woman’s husband, who has tested negative for the infection, is not cooperating with the civic body in its effort to identify the source of the infection or in containing spread. The civic body has sealed Baijipura locality and is screening all high-risk and low-risk contacts.
