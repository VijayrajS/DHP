Indian girl in Brazil offers her savings for PM’s fund to fight coronavirus
2020-04-22
RAICHUR: Moved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal for monetary support to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, a 10-year-old Brazil-based Raichur girl requested the Prime Minister to divert her Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana savings to the PM-CARES fund.


Lahari Rangarao Desai, who is residing with her parents at Curitiba, the capital of the southern Brazilian state of Paraná, says she was deeply touched by the Prime Minister’s appeal in this hour of crisis. 

Lahari’s father has been depositing money in her Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana account under the Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme (SSS), which she is aware of. Lahari is pursuing her fourth grade at Colégio Positivo Internacional in Curitiba.

SSS is a small deposit scheme for the girl child, launched as a part of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign. The account will be functional till a girl turns 21, and up to 50% withdrawal of savings is allowed for education purposes, when a girl turns 18.

This means with the existing clause, she cannot contribute money from her account to the PM-CARES fund.

Lahari said, “I am requesting the Prime Minister to relax regulations, for the government to withdraw the entire sum deposited as savings in my SSS account. There is Rs 5,000 available in it. With this I want to do my small bit for India, in its fight against Covid 19.”

Lahari also recorded a video message in which she said, “I am with you in the fight against coronavirus by staying at home. Now I want to give money to the PM-CARE fund. But I don’t have money with me now. Can you take money from my Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana account? My father puts money in my account for my future. I feel my future is secured with you as the Prime Minister. Bharat Mata Ki Jai.”
