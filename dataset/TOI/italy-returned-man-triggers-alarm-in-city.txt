Coronavirus outbreak: Italy-returned man triggers alarm in Chennai
2020-03-13
CHENNAI: An Indian national who has been roaming around Chennai after visiting Covid-19-hit Italy sent health officials into a tizzy on Thursday. The 27-year-old, who arrived in New Delhi from Milan on March 4, was taken to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) on Thursday, but doctors there let him go as he did not show flu-like symptoms. Hours later, after realising he had a travel history to Milan, they tracked him down to a hotel in the city.


The man was about to board an Air India flight to Port Blair at Chennai airport

on Thursday when he complained to the airline staff that he was feeling feverish. “The staff did not want to take a risk and sent him to the general hospital in an ambulance,” said an airport official. Officials said they did not know why the man, who should have been on 28-day home quarantine, was roaming around the city. “When he said he was feeling unwell, we decided he should be treated first,” said a senior airport official.

Unlike the international terminal, the domestic facility does not have a team to screen passengers for Covid-19.


Doctors were not aware man had travelled to Italy
The man was sent to RGGH where doctors and paramedics did a basic screening. “By the time he reached the hospital, he had no fever. The doctors did not know the passenger had travelled to Italy and so he was asked to go. We are enquiring how the breach in quarantine protocol happened not once but twice,” a senior health official said.

The man then checked into a city hotel. However, by evening when the directorate of public health realised the slip, they tracked him down to the hotel. At the time of filing the report, an ambulance was sent to ferry him to Government Stanley Medical College hospital.
