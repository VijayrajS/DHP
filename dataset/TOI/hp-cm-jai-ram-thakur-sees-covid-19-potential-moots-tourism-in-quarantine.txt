2020-05-24
SHIMLA: Amid the latest Covid-19 spike in the hill state, Himachal Pradesh (HP) chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has mooted the idea of developing the state as a destination for ‘tourism in quarantine’. Explaining the rationale, he said as the virus spread wanes, people who are advised 14-15 days quarantine could come to HP.


While interacting with media, Thakur said the tourism industry in the state – an international tourism destination --has taken a big hit in the pandemic and the losses are not likely to be made up soon. Apart from this, he said the tourism industry is major employment generator in the state, and the government is looking for ways to improve the situation. In line with this, the government is working on the concept of projecting HP as destination for quarantine as this would boost the tourism sector. He said even now many people wish to come to Himachal due to low coronavirus count.

Referring to the quarantine set-up in the state, he said those coming to HP from other states are being quarantined, those from green zones are being home quarantined and people coming from red zones are being institutional quarantined.
