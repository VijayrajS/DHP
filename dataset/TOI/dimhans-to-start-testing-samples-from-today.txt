2020-04-20
Hubballi: The Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Dimhans) will start testing samples for the novel coronavirus from Monday. This means that the Bombay-Karnataka region now has two laboratories – Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi being the other one – dedicated to testing samples for the pandemic. 

Although ICMR gave the nod for Dimhans to go ahead with the tests on April 7, the institute had been waiting for the equipment. KIMS, meanwhile, started conducting tests from April 8. Dimhans director Mahesh Desai confirmed that they had started testing samples for the Covid-19 infection on an experimental basis, and the laboratory would commence full-fledged operations from Monday.
