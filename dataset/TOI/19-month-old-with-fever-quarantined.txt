2020-02-12
PUNE: A 19-month-old boy, who had recently travelled to China with his parents, was quarantined at the civic-run Naidu hospital on Tuesday after he developed cough and fever.


“The boy’s family resides in the city. He, along with his parents, had returned from Beijing on January 25,” Ramchandra Hankare, the PMC’s health department chief, said.

“We had to also quarantine his parents as the boy is too young. We have provided them with N95 masks as a precautionary measure to check the spread of contagion. The boy’s throat swab sample will be sent to the NIV for testing,” Hankare said.
