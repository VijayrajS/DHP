100 families from Gadag hotspot quarantined
2020-04-25
Hubballi: About 100 families in the Rangawadi, a small street in Gadag where four Covid-19 cases were reported, have been shifted to a quarantine facility.

The district administration’s decision – claimed by officials as the first of its kind exercise in the state -- is aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus.

All the cases reported in the district are from the same locality. An 80-year-old woman died while availing treatment at Gadag Institute of Medical Sciences, and three others are being treated at an isolation ward of the hospital.

The contact tracing of the first patient did not yield any result. The authorities were busy tracing the primary and secondary contacts of the deceased after which three more cases came to the fore, leaving little breathing room for the district administration.

Gadag deputy commissioner M G Hiremath said, “There were many primary and secondary contacts of those who contracted the disease at Ranganwadi. Hence, we decided to quarantine every one living in the area to a government facility and send their throat swab samples to the laboratory. This was the only way to contain the disease. They have been quarantined since Monday. At one go, we sent 104 samples for testing, after which 76 more samples were sent. A total of 180 samples were sent for testing of residents from Ranganwadi. We have received test results of almost all the samples sent, which have tested negative for Covid-19, and a few reports are yet to come.”
