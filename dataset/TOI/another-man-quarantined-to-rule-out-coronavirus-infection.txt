PUNE: A 33-year-old traveller, who returned from the novel coronavirus-affected Vietnam recently, was isolated at the civic-run Naidu hospital to rule out contagion possibility late on Sunday evening after he complained of minor illness.


“The man, a resident of Pune, had returned from Vietnam on February 8 and had been under our surveillance since then. We quarantined him on Sunday evening after he developed cough and fever,” Ramchandra Hankare, the chief of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department, said.

The man’s throat swab sample will be tested at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for the novel coronavirus infection, he said, adding, “Another 26-year-old traveller, who was quarantined on Sunday, tested negative for the virus and was discharged on Monday.”

“Of the 37 travellers with minor illnesses, 36 have tested negative for the infection in the state so far,” a state health official said.
