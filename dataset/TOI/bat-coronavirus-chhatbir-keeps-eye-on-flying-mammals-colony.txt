Bat coronavirus: Chandigarh's Chhatbir Zoo keeps eye on flying mammals’ colony
2020-04-17
MOHALI: Two days after a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) — which found the presence of a different kind of coronavirus (bat coronavirus: BtCoV) — was published, the management of Chhatbir zoo has decided to test every dead bat. 


Chhatbir zoo has a full colony of fruit bats, who have been put under a watch now, said zoo field director M Sudhagar. He said, “At present, we have no evidence of bats here having coronavirus. But these bats generally are immune to many viruses and bacteria, which they carry inside their bodies. So, it has been decided not to take any chances and test every dead bat. We will not disturb their natural habitat, and conduct test only if a dead bat is found. An order to keep a strict vigil on the bats’ colony at zoo has been issued to the caretaker. The Punjab wildlife department will write to Panjab University to inform if they also find any dead bat at a small colony on the campus.”

The authorities sat up and took note after news reports were recently published, saying that as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, researchers have found presence of a different kind of coronavirus — bat coronavirus (BtCoV) — in two species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. This was a first of its kind study by the Indian Council of Medical Research, whose researchers discovered the viruses while surveying bats in Myanmar as part of a government-funded programme called PREDICT to identify infectious diseases that have the potential to hop from animals to humans. And bats are prime suspects, as the flying mammals are thought to host thousands of yet-to-be-discovered coronaviruses. 

It is also being presumed that the Covid-19 virus emerged from the bats in China, which were reportedly consumed by people after which they got infected.
