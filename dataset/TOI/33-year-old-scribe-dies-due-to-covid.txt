Hyderabad: A journalist, who was working for a Telugu news channel, died in Gandhi Hospital on Sunday while undergoing treatment for Covid-19.

Gandhi Hospital authorities said that the 33-year-old journalist was declared dead at 9.37 am.

“He was already suffering from Myasthenia gravis (MG), in which muscles, including respiratory muscles will have weaknesses. He had surgery for it (his thymus gland was removed) and was on steroids for the condition. With this comorbidity, he became Covid-19 positive and had bilateral pneumonia with type 1 respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We tried our best but he couldn’t be revived,” Gandhi Hospital authorities said in a statement.

The journalist got admitted in Gandhi hospital on Thursday after he was referred by Fever Hospital when he tested positive for Covid-19. 

He developed breathlessness by Thursday afternoon and was shifted to ICU. 

Since then, he was being treated in the ICU.
