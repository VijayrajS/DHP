2020-04-05
KOLKATA: Troops of the South Bengal Frontier of the Border Security Force (BSF) seized fake Indian currency notes (FICN) of face value worth Rs 4 lakh in two incidents in the Malda district of West Bengal on Saturday. A FICN smuggler was also apprehended and handed over to the police along with the seized currency notes. 


In the first incident, BSF troops of the 24Bn posted at the Gopalnagar BOP received information about Md Tashlim Sk (45), a villager from the Kaliachak area who used to cross the International Border Fence to tend to his land. The BSF personnel kept watch on him and at around 12.10pm, he was spotted moving in a suspicious manner towards a point on the zero-line. He apparently picked up a packet from there before being nabbed by the BSF. On being searched, FICN of face value Rs 200,000 were found hidden in his clothing. 

"He has been handed over to the Gopalganj police station with the FICN. Earlier in the day, another seizure was made by troops posted at the Sukhdevpur BOP. Acting on a tip-off the BSF personnel searched the area around the border fence and recovered a packet containing FICN of face value Rs 200,000. This was handed over to the Baishnabnagar police station," a senior BSF official said. 

In 2020, the BSF's South Bengal Frontier seized FICN of face value Rs 20,63,000, the official confirmed.
