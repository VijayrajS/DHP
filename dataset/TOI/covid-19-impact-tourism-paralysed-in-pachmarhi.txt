Covid-19 impact: Tourism paralysed in Pachmarhi
2020-05-22
BHOPAL: Coronavirus induced lockdown has completely paralysed the tourism in Pachmarhi, one of the popular hill stations of Madhya Pradesh. Livelihood of about 10,000 people has been affected due to lockdown, leading to an estimated loss of over Rs 50 crore, claim sources

Popularly known as Queen of Satpura, Pachmarhi, situated about 200 kms away from Bhopal at a height of 1067 metres, has been attracting tourists from across the world. Since the lockdown, over 500 gypsies ferrying tourists from one place to another, have stopped operating . The hotels are closed and there are no activities at various tourist spots of this hill station, which buzzed with people during summer months. The temple bells are quiet and the sunset point of Dhoopgarh has no viewers. The ripples of joblessness have reached the neighbouring districts of Narsighpur, Seoni and Chhindwara too, as large number of labourers , cooks, artisans and small-time traders have already left the city.

Chankya Bakshi, a hotelier and former vice president of the Cantonment board, said, “People in Pachmarhi are totally depended on tourism and activities related to it. No agriculture or any activities of collection of forest produce is done here. Large quantity of vegetables grown in small towns around this hill station also have no takers now because all the hotels are closed.”

Manoj Dubey , a social worker based at Pachmarhi said, “This is the peak tourism season in Pachmarhi and many people had invested a lot just before the lockdown. That money, perhaps, will never be recovered. Most of the smaller private hotels in Pachmarhi belong to middle-class people and this deadly virus has broken their backbone. While deciding on the relief measures for affected people, the government should also keep people of Pachmarhi in mind.”
