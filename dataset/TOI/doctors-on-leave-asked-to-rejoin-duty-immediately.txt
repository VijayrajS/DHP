2020-03-19
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health minister K K Shailaja has urged all the doctors and other health department employees who are on leave to re-join duty with immediate effect. 

It has also been decided to extend the working time of primary health centres in the state till 6 in the evening. The government has also decided to appoint doctors on a temporary basis if there is any shortage in any district. 

Meanwhile, at Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, none of the doctors or employees who had been under quarantine tested positive in the preliminary tests. The detailed results are awaited, said a statement issued by the institute.

“No positive cases have been reported today. Strict monitoring has been introduced. Around 100 employees are on self-quarantine. An internal screening was conducted today at the institute,” said the statement. 

The management has also initiated welfare activities to those in quarantine with the help of faculties and employees.

The Regional Cancer Centre has brought out certain regulations for crowd control. The director has said no person, who travelled from the Covid-19-hit countries in the past one month, will be allowed inside the hospital. Such people should avoid accompanying or mingling with cancer patients as it is highly risky since those with cancer have very low resistance power.

In Pathanamthitta, due to the closure of educational institutions in other states, more students have started returning. After the three students who came from Kalaburagi, seven students from Telangana also reached the district.

The students coming from other states have been asked to contact the district call centre @ 0468-2228220.

District collector P B Nooh said all religious heads have been requested not to allow more than ten people to attend religious functions or rituals.
