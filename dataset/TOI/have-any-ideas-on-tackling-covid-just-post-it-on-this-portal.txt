Bhopal: The coronavirus pandemic is the only thing being discussed the world over for the past few weeks. Over 135 crore people in India, who are locked in their homes to maintain social distancing, are abuzz with ideas to control the deadly disease. While not all ideas may be useful, all would not be useless either. A Gwalior-based techie has created a platform to give voice to the people of the country on the Corona issue. Kapil Gupta, a 2012 batch engineer, created republicindia.in wherein people can give their suggestions to fight corona that would directly reach to government of India and to all chief ministers of the country.In the past 72 hours, at least 10,000 suggestions have been put forth on the platform from different parts of the country. Once a is posted on the portal, within seconds, it goes to the Union health ministry and to chief ministers of all states in the country.The portal is trending on top on Google and whenever a person types to give suggestion to any government, it opens first, even above the government sites.“The suggestion to use vacant rail coaches as isolation wards since there is a shortage of isolation wards in the country was also sent to the government from this platform. It was sent by a youth, Swapnil Dattatray kadu Swapnil from Songaon in Maharashtra, mentioning that since there are toilets, bed and electricity in train coaches and trains are not running in lockdown, doctors can easily use the coaches to attend to patients,” said Gupta.The suggestion was sent on March 26 and was just one among over 10,000 suggestions sent in the past three days, but we do not claim that government accepted any of them, as the government did not write back to us acknowledging the suggestions, Gupta said. He added: “We do not accept any promotion or advertisement on the platform and the purpose is solely to give a platform to the masses to pour in their suggestion to the state governments as well as Union government.”
