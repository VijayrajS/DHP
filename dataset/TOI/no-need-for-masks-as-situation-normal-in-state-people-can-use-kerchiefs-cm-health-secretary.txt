2020-03-06
Accompanied by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, health minister Rajesh Tope, BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and principal health secretary Pradeep Vyas said on Thursday people in the state did not need to wear a mask to prevent Coronavirus as the situation is normal here. “But health workers treating patients and those working at the international airport should wear masks as a precautionary measure,” said Vyas at Vidhan Bhavan. He added that citizens could use handkerchiefs to cover their faces.


Even as they advised people to not press the panic button, both the CM and Vyas asked them to take precautions by avoiding mass gatherings. Both also spoke about preparations made by the government to fight the epidemic if it hits the state. “Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai and IGMC in Nagpur, apart from Pune’s NIV, were provided with facilities to test suspected cases. We are also waiting for guidelines from the central government on tackling the virus threat,” they said. Announcing helpline 1916 for Coronavirus cases in Mumbai, Pardesi said close to 70,000 persons have been screened at the airport. “There will be no screening on domestic trains and bus terminals, as on date.” Tope said, “It’s not an airborne disease. A three-metre distance must be maintained from patients. Frequent handwash is a must.”

In the assembly, Thackeray called on people to limit Holi celebrations. “The next eight-10 days are crucial and we all need to take precautions. Citizens should avoid mass gatherings and tone down Holi celebrations... Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already declared he won’t be playing Holi in wake of the virus.”
