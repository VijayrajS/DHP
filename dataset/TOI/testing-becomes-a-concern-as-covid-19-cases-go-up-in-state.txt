Testing becomes a concern as Covid-19 cases go up in state
2020-06-13
With the number of Covid-19 positive cases on the rise in several districts across the state, testing of samples has become a cause for concern. While health officials say they have ramped up sample collection and testing, data shows testing in some districts is very low.For instance, Ariyalur, which figures in the top 10 Covid-hit districts in the state with 391 cases, has one of the lowest sample testing numbers. According to the health officials there, only 60 to 100 samples are tested a day. This is despite the district having 26 active cases.Some of the other Covid-hit districts are not any better, despite showing higher number of sample testing per day. On Friday, a man identified as Andrew was turned away when he went to the government hospital in Madurai for test. Even after informing the staff that he was from Chennai, a hotspot, he was not entertained. He was summoned and tested only after the issue was taken up with collector T G Vinay.Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has been raising issues for the past several days noting that testing has to be ramped up.According to the government data, Madurai district, with a population of about 30 lakh, had tested 14,102 people as on June 8, which translates to 3,975 tests per million (TPM) population. But districts, which have lesser population than Madurai, has been testing more. For example, Tuticorin, with a population of just over 17.50 lakh, has done 13,227 tests, which translates into 6963 TPM.The Madurai collector, however, says they are testing 500 samples on an average daily, which is adequate. All those entering the district and those with symptoms, contacts of positive cases are tested, he says.Ariyalur officials too sounded content with the current testing numbers. Officials there say since there are very few people visiting hospitals with flu symptoms requiring tests and even lesser entering the district now, the number of tests were less.In Coimbatore, deputy director of health services G Ramesh Kumar said, on an average 600 samples are tested daily. When the cases dropped to zero, the testing also fell to 200 samples a day in May. As influx of people started after opening of district borders, the samples tested per day rose to 400 samples. With flights, trains and buses coming to the district with droves of people, sample testing has gradually increased. On some days the samples go up to 800, he said. “We will increase testing if required,” he said. Health officials in other districts too said they were prepared to increase sample collection and testing in the coming days, if required.Trichy collector S Sivarasu said the central district has ramped up testing to 500 samples a day. “Not just government hospital, but pregnant women, people with severe acute respiratory infection and influenza like illness visiting primary health centres are also tested,” he said.
