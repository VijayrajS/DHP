JAIPUR: 52 Indians including a few students, who have been stranded at the Poland’s capital Warsaw for the past three days after their flights got rescheduled thrice, have appealed to the Indian government to facilitate their return at the earliest. “If the government doesn’t help, where do we go?” asked one of the passengers.
