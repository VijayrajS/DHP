Midnapore teacher defends Naga doc against virus bullies
2020-05-13
Kolkata: In times of harassment of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who are Covid warriors on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic, a chemistry teacher in Midnapore has imparted an exemplary lesson by protecting his tenant, a young doctor from distant Dimapur in Nagaland.

Biswajit Dey has not only offered to waive rent of Angukato Z Achumi during the pandemic but also approached police against locals’ recent harassment of the doctor.

Angukato, a second-year post-graduate student of surgery at Midnapore Medical College, was walking home for dinner from hospital when three bike-borne youths hurled racial comments at him and accused him of bringing coronavirus into the locality. The doctor kep quiet, completed half-a-kilometre walk, had his dinner and returned to hospital for the rest of the 24-hour shift. 

“I was deeply hurt but kept it to myself,” Angukato told TOI. 

Back at the hospital, Angukato conducted emergency surgeries. At home the next morning, his landlord found him upset. Dey then found out that the doctor had been harassed by those locals on previous occasions too during the pandemic.

“I was furious. How can people harass these Covid warriors when they are fighting one of the toughest battles of their lives,” said the teacher. Dey informed the Kotwali police station, where he was assured that Angukato would not be harassed again. 

Dey has been creating awareness among his neighbours against harassing his tenant. “It is my duty to stand by a doctor who is fighting upfront for patients,” the teacher said.

Angukato, who stays in the rented flat with his mother and younger brother, could have returned to Nagaland, a state that has so far not recorded a single Covid case. But the doctor said: “I am upset and hurt by the harassment I faced. But my landlord’s support has made me all the more resolute to take my duties head-on.”
