LUDHIANA: The police on Wednesday arrested three men, who posed as transgenders, on the charge of attempt to murder after they mixed phenyl in the drinking water tank of a quarantine centre in Krishan Colony of Jodhewal. 

According to the police, one of the accused wanted revenge from cops, as they had arrested his brother in December 2019 in snatching and theft cases. The accused have been identified as Guniya, alias Nitika Khunsi, 25, Gaurav, 25, and Simran, 24, of Krishan Colony. 

An FIR was lodged on the complaint of constable Gurpinder Singh.

The constable said he was earlier in the security of Jodhewal SHO sub-inspector Arshpreet Kaur Grewal. When she tested positive for Covid-19, he, along with constable Rajinder Singh and sub-inspector Amritpal Sharma, were quarantined in a house of a building in Krishna Colony. Later, other contacts of Covid-19-positive patients were also quarantined there. After his isolation period ended, he, along with two other cops, was put on security duty at the centre.” 

He said on Monday evening, when he opened the drinking water tap, he smelled phenyl in it and went upstairs to check. In the tank, he found phenyl mixed in the water. On questioning, area residents said they saw three men near the rooftop tank. Before going to the building, the trio had told some residents that they were going to teach cops a lesson. 

Sub-inspector Arshpreet Kaur Grewal said, “Guniya is a man, but has been living as a transgender with Gaurav and Simran. The police have also got the accused medically examined and they were found to be men. They indulge in illegal activities, like drug peddling. Guniya’s brother, Jatinder Singh Pappi, was arrested by Jodhewal police in December 2019. He is lodged in jail at present. Following Jatinder’s arrest, Guniya nurtured a rivalry against the police and therefore took the step.”
