LUCKNOW: A 53-year-old woman from Alambagh, a breast cancer patient, had her first chemotherapy session lined up at SGPGIMS on Monday morning but had to return without treatment as the OPD was closed.


Like her, over 200 patients of nephrology, hematology, chemotherapy and pain clinic who visited the OPD had to return without treatment. Emergency and Covid-19 services, however, remained unaffected. The institute decided to shut its OPD on Monday after an elderly patient from Khadra, who had visited nephrology OPD on Saturday, was tested Covid-19 positive.

The elder brother of cancer patient from Alambagh said, “We had been given appointment for Monday and asked to come with two test reports. When we reached the OPD, the guard informed us about the closure.”

Chief medical superintendent (CMS) Prof Amit Agarwal said, “Chemotherapy cannot be done in the OPD now. An alternative has been established in palliative wing of A block for such patients. They can reschedule their appointment with the doctor.”

While SGPGI has started consultation with doctors through telemedicine service and launched numbers for it on Sunday, public relations officer (PRO) Kusum Yadav said nephrology OPD had been fully sanitized and medical team which came in contact with the patient had been put under quarantine. “PGI director Dr RK Dhiman has informed that only eight persons were present in the nephrology OPD on Saturday when the patient visited for consultation. He was admitted to our Covid-19 hospital,” she said.
