Nashik: The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), Nashik division has decided to begin the process of evaluating answer sheet of the SSC (Class X) students after May 3.Nitin Upasani, divisional secretary, Nashik, said the collection of answer sheets in Nashik division, which covers Nashik, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts, will begin after the lockdown is lifted.“Now that the remaining SSC examination of Geography, which was scheduled on March 23 has been cancelled, we want to gear up for the process of bringing out the result so that there is no delay from our side,” Upasani told TOI.The divisional board office will send a pick-up truck with two of their representatives to all the collection centers to collect the answer sheets. “The centers will not have to send the answer sheets to their headquarters. This will reduce crowding and help in maintaining social distancing,” added Upasani.The Nashik divisional board has also instructed all its examiners to collect the answer sheets from their respective centres and start the evaluation. Those who have already evaluated the answer sheets, should send them to the moderators.There are 150 moderators for each subject of SSC in Nashik division, who have about 10 examiners under each of them. “We have received a few answer sheets of Mathematics. We have also assigned the examiners to correct the answer sheets of students with learning disability,” added Upasani.Moreover, about 92% of the HSC moderation work and collection of answer sheets has been completed, he said.
