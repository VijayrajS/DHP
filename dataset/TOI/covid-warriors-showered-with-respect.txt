Surat: For Asad Saiyed, a resident of Muzammil Park society on the Sirpura road in Bharuch town, it was an unusual festival where he offered prayers at home on Eid. But, he was happy. He got a chance to appreciate the frontline workers for their tremendous contribution in the fight against Covid and celebrated the festival with them.

“We invited 30 corona warriors including staff of 108 ambulance, 181 Abhayam helpline and safai workers to celebrate Eid with us. About 100 Muslim households in the society members offered special prayers for these staffers’ good health and prosperity. It was a unique feeling when we showered ‘Eidi’ on them — flowers and sweets — and this will remain permanently etched in my memory,” Saiyed said.

It made for a grand show when these 30 staffers walked down the 100 houses and every household showered them with their love in flower petals.

Shabbir Diwan, an ONGC employee in Dahej said, that the idea first struck him during Ramzan and when he shared it with the society members, they all readily agreed. “The atmosphere was surcharged with emotion as everyone enjoyed the special celebration,” Diwan added. 

According to Diwan, nobody bought new clothes and many donated food and clothes to the poor people in the nearby slum areas to mark the festival.

Ashok Mistry, emergency management executive (EME) of 108 service in Bharuch district said, “It was overwhelming to receive such a reception on Eid festival. Though working on the front is part of our duty, but such acts of compassion boost our confidence.”
