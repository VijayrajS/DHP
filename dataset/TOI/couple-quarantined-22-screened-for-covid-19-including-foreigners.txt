Agra: The health department surveillance team on Wednesday admitted an Agra couple at the isolation facility of the district hospital, after they were found with suspicious health condition.

Residents of Sikandra, the man (40) is a worker at a private shoe factory, whose owner and his son are currently quarantined in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital for Covid-19 infection. Dr Satish Verma, superintendent in-charge of district hospital, said, “Two weeks back, the man had visited the hospital and was found normal, but our surveillance team, who were in constant touch with him, found his wife too has developed suspicious health condition.”

“On Wednesday, the couple was brought to our isolation facility and put under observation. Our teams have also screened 22 people, including train passengers, foreign nationals and locals, who arrived from Covid-19 affected countries,” he added.

Among those screened were an Australian, an Argentine and four local women who had arrived from Dubai and Switzerland. Three of them, who landed from Dubai, travelled in Kongu Express from Delhi to Agra. Their samples were collected by health department staff.

The Agra DM has issued an advisory to local residents that they should avoid visiting Kaila Devi Temple in Rajasthan, which locals traditionally visit after Holi to offer prayers and make wishes.

The same order has been communicated by Karauli DM Mohanlal Yadav too. Kaila Devi Trust has shut down the temple.
