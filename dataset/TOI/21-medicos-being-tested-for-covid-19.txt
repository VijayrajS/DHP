NASHIK: Throat swab samples of 21 medical staff, including three doctors, from a government hospital in Malegaon have been sent for Covid-19 testing after five of the six patients admitted there tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday night.


One of the five positive patients at the government hospital already succumbed to the disease on Wednesday afternoon. “The moment we received the test reports of the patients, we collected the throat swab samples of 18 nurses and three doctors at the hospital and sent them for testing,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.

The process of contact tracing has begun to figure out how many people came in contact with the positive patients. Their family members are also being located so that they too can be tested.

Besides, a private medical practitioner has also been asked to be quarantined after the deceased person was reportedly been treated by him as well.

“The private medical practitioner had treated the patient in his clinic and since the patient turned out to be positive, the doctor has been asked to quarantine himself. His clinic has been closed and sanitized. Patients taking treatment from him will also be tracked down and tested for Covid-19,” a district administration official said.
