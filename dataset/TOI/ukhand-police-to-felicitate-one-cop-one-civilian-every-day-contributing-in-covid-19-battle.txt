Dehradun: In a move to boost the morale of those involved in the fight against novel coronavirus, the Uttarakhand Police have decided to award one police personnel and one civilian in each district every day.

Apart from that, a list of police personnel and individuals —who have made extraordinary contribution —would be prepared and their name would be recommended for an award on the Independence Day parade ceremony. 

“I have directed the police chief in all the districts to identify a corona warrior – a police personnel in their respective districts. Besides, they will also prepare a list of individuals, who have been contributing for the cause,” director general of police (DGP) (law and order) Ashok Kumar said. 

While a cash reward would be given to the police personnel the civilian would be felicitated with a letter of appreciation. 

“For those who made an outstanding contribution, we will recommend their names for the award that will be given on the Independence Day parade event,” said the senior police officer.
