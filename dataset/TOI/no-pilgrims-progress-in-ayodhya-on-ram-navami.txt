Covid-19 threat: No pilgrim’s progress in Ayodhya on Ram Navami
2020-03-22
AYODHYA: The coronavirus threat forced the district administration on Saturday to clamp severe restrictions on the centuries-old Ram Navami Mela in Ayodhya — a mega event that particularly triggered religious fervour this year in the aftermath of the Supreme Court verdict on Ramjanmabhoomi title suit.


While temple doors won’t be shut, crowding at shrines has been banned along with sealing of Ayodhya’s borders to prevent congregation of pilgrims, which peaks to 10-15 lakh during Ram Navami.

TOI was first to report about the administration’s decision to pare down the Ram Navami Mela. According to seers, this will be the first time in thousands of years that devotees will be stopped from participating in the age-old Ram Navami Mela. Influx of devotees to the holy town was expected to begin from March 25, the first day of Navratra, followed by Ram Navami Mela on April 2.

While pilgrims won’t be allowed to enter Ayodhya till April 2 (Ram Navami), devotees have also been banned from taking a bath in Saryu on the auspicious day. “Covid-19 infection spreads swiftly and the traditional bath in Saryu will not be allowed this time,” said Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha.

Talking to TOI, Jha said, “The administration will barricade all entry points to the district and pilgrims will be stopped at the border and sent back. The administration has also instructed owners and managers of hotels and dharamshalas to not attend to any guest or entertain bookings during the entire Navratra period. Hoteliers have been specifically instructed to cancel all earlier bookings too.”

Using his special powers, the DM also decided to ban group movements during Ram Navami in the town to prevent citizens from becoming vulnerable to infection,” he said.
