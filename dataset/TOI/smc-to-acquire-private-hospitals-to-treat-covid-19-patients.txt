Surat: After Ahmedabad civic body, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is preparing to acquire beds in private hospital for the treatment and isolation of the Covid-19 patients. This is being done in anticipation of spike in the coronavirus cases over the next few days.

The civic body has intimated about 84 small and big private hospitals in the city, having total bed capacity of 6,300. The hospitals will be required to allot 50% of the beds for coronavirus patients. 

Talking with TOI, deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospital), Dr Ashish Naik said, “Spike in the coronavirus cases is anticipated and we may require more beds in the coming days. We plan to acquire 50% beds in the private hospitals across the city for the same.” 

Dr Naik added, “The current infrastructure to treat the Covid-19 patients is sufficient, but need may soon arise to acquire beds in the private hospitals. There are 84 big and small private hospitals and all have been intimated.”

Asked about the rates in the hospital for Covid-19 patients, Dr Naik said, “Private hospitals have moved to the Gujarat High Court over the price cap. We are awaiting the HC order and take decision on the rates accordingly.” 

A SMC health official said that the Covid-19 cases are on the rise as people have started moving out due to the lockdown relaxations. “It is anticipated that the daily cases may increase to 50 in the next couple of days,” he added.

Official sources said that the SMC-run SMIMER hospital, which is a non-Covid hospital, may be converted to the Covid hospital with 850 beds capacity. However, the total beds available with the civic body is about 2,200.
