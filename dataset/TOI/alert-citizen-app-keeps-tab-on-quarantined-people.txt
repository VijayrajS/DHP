Rajkot: Jamnagar district police have made an ‘Alert Citizen’ mobile app through which the cops can keep tab on the people under quarantine.“So far, we have made 4,000 people download this app on their mobilephones. Every quarantined person has to upload his photo on this app, through which his location can be ascertained. If the person switches off the location or the internet, we immediately get an alert,” says Jamnagar assistant superintendent of police Safin Hassan. So far, one person has been booked for the alleged violation of home quarantine with the help of this application. “Kanti Sarvada (53) was caught with the help of this app when he stepped out of his house and we book him under sections 270 and 188 of Indian Penal Code and section 51 (B) of the Disaster Management Act 2005,” says ASP Hassan. “The application maintains the record of person’s name, address, quarantine period, blood group and travel history. The application uses GPS system and generates a report in every 12 hours,” adds ASP Hassan.
