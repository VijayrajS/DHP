Coronavirus in Gurugram: RWAs sell masks, hand sanitisers at subsidised rates
2020-03-10
GURUGRAM: RWAs across New Gurugram have joined hands with NGOs to hold camps offering hand sanitisers and masks to residents at subsidised rates, as they have vanished from chemist shops after people resorted to panic buying amid the coronavirus outbreak. They are also trying to spread awareness in condominiums.


Societies where RWAs conducted or plan to conduct camps include Sare Homes (sector 92), DLF Regal Garden (Sector 90), BPTP Park Prime (Sector 66) and Vatika India Next (Sector 82). 

On Sunday, a drug control department team had seized 3.5 lakh masks and 2,500 bottles of hand sanitisers from 70 shops. These seized items will now be sold from 40 stores across the city at 20% discount so that complaints of shortage can be addressed.

 “Lack of availability of these hand sanitisers and masks is a serious concern. We’ve have tied up with an NGO to provide them at subsidised rates through camps,” Praveen Malik, president of SARE Homes RWA in Sector 92, said. 

Congress functionary Capt Ajay Yadav said, “The government agencies should conduct raids in Gurugram to prevent hoarding of masks and sanitisers. Artificial shortage has been created by these people.”

Meanwhile, the District Legal Service Authority organised a medical awareness camp to quell fears about Covid-19 on Monday.
