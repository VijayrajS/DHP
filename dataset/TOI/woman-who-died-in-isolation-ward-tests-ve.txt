MADURAI: Blood samples of a 59-year-old woman who died on Saturday while being in the isolation ward at Kanyakumari Government Medical College Hospital tested negative for Covid-19 on Sunday, said hospital authorities.


Though hospital dean Dr R Suganthy confirmed on Saturday that the woman did not have any travel history, she suffered a heart failure. As a precautionary measure, the hospital had kept her body in the mortuary until the results are out. 

On Sunday, the samples of the woman and four others sent to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital came back with negative results.

The four other patients admitted to the isolation ward on Saturday in Kanyakumari and later tested negative for Covid-19 are an eight-month-old baby who returned from abroad, a 49-year-old man who returned from abroad, a 26-year-old man from Kerala and a 52-year-old woman with no travel history. So far, no person from Kanyakumari district has tested positive for Covid-19.
