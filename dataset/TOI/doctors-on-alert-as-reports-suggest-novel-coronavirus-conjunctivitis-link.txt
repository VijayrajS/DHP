Doctors on alert as reports suggest novel coronavirus-conjunctivitis link
2020-02-01
PUNE: The novel coronavirus may cause conjunctivitis too, besides flu-like and respiratory symptoms.


The American Academy of Ophthalmology has issued an alert stating that there were anecdotal reports suggesting that the novel coronavirus can cause conjunctivitis and possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva — the tissue lining the inside of the eyelids. Following the alert, the pan-India body of eye surgeons directed its members to keep a high index of suspicion while treating such patients.


 
Eye surgeon S Natarajan, president of All India Ophthalmological Society, a national body of over 20,000 eye surgeons in India, said, “We have told eye surgeons to stay alert while treating patients with history of travelling to novel coronavirus-hit nations or coming in contact with people who have travelled to affected countries recently.”

Eye surgeon Vardhaman Kankariya, secretary of Maharashtra Ophthalmological Society, said, “An eye surgeon should use protective N-95mask and specified goggles while examining such patients. All patients with conjunctivitis should not worry as the alert is only for patients who have travelled to China or come in contact with patients who have had such international trip.”

Eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar, who heads the Pune-based National Institute of Ophthalmology, said, “The virus may enter the eyes when an infected patient touches them with his hands. The virus, thought to be spreading through sneezes and coughs, can also pass through the body to reach the eye, causing conjunctivitis. Hence, precautions are the way forward .”
