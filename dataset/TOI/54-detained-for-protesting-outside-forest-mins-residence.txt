Dehradun: Around 150 men belonging to the “Uttarakhand Berozgaar Union” on Sunday staged a protest outside the residence of forest minister Harak Singh Rawat in Dehradun against unemployment and cheating scam in the recent forest guard recruitment exam. They demanded that the forest guard exams conducted on February 16 be declared void. 

The protestors raised slogans outside the residence of the forest minister, who is also the UPNL minister. They wanted to hand over a memorandum to him, but Rawat wasn’t present at his residence at the time. City magistrate Mayaram Joshi offered to take the memorandum but the protestors insisted on giving it to the forest minister.

Police detained 54 of them and took them to Sudhowala prison. The men continued their protest there and demanded that they be taken to dharna sthal.

The protestors claimed that they called on the CM’s helpline number so they could be taken to Dharna Sthal, but to no avail. “We called them and asked for a vehicle to be arranged to take us to dharna sthal as we didn’t have the money for cab fare. They brought us 20 kms from the city and refused to take us back,” said Bobby Panwar, chairperson, Uttarakhand Berozgaar Union.

The protestors also demanded that all 18,000 vacancies in the state government announced by the chief minister in July 2018 be filled. Also, they demanded that the annual examination calendar of Uttarakhand be released.
