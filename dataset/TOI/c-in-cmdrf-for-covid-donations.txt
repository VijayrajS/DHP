Dedicated a/c in CMDRF for Covid donations
2020-04-09
Thiruvananthapuram: Special arrangements are being put in place for the management of contributions in CMDRF towards Covid-19 related relief activities, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

As part of this, sub-accounts (CMDRF account number 2) would be opened in 18 banks. Treasury savings account would also be started in the same name. The contributions received in CMDRF since March 27 would be transferred to the new account. A new link in the home page of government website has been introduced so that contributors can directly open the dedicated account for Covid-19 relief. However, there is no change in the mode of payment to CMDRF.
