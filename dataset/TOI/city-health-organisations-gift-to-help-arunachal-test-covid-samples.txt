Kolkata health organisation’s gift to help Arunachal Pradesh test Covid-19 samples
2020-04-14
KOLKATA: A gift from the City of Joy is now going to assume an important role in the battle against coronavirus in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. An RT-PCR machine that was sent by Liver Foundation, West Bengal (LFWB), to Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (TRIHMS), Naharlagun, will now be used to conduct Covid-19 tests in the state. This is the first time the state will have its own testing facilities.


“So far Arunachal had been sending swab samples to the ICMR lab in Dibrugarh in Assam. Once we start taking in samples, a lot of time will be saved in getting test reports. Thanks to LFWB for the machine, which has come handy in the time of such a crisis,” said Moji Jini, director TRIHMS.

However, the machine was installed at the microbiology unit of the institute nine months ago for a different purpose. LFWB has been working with TRIHMS for few years now on hepatitis research and the machine was given to the institute to enhance collaborative studies on hepatitis by LFWB with support from US-based John C Martin Foundation. The Covid-19 pandemic has made the institute switch its focus for now.

“The machine that was meant for hepatitis research has been re-purposed for Covid-19 studies. We are happy to contribute,” said hepatologist Abhjit Chaowdhury, secretary LFWB.

Till now Arunachal has reported only one positive case of Covid-19. All the nearly 400 samples collected from suspected patients in the state were sent to the ICMR laboratory in Dibrugarh via road. Therefore, it would take 48 hours to get the reports. “We are giving final touches. Our team will be ready to start testing samples soon. We expect things to be faster and easier with this machine,” said Jini.
