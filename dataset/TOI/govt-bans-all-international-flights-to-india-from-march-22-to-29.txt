The Directorate General of Civil Aviation told airlines, both Indian and foreign, that no passenger flight will take off from any airport outside the country for any airport in India after 5.30am IST (0000 hours GMT) on Sunday (March 22).


 

The government also directed Metros, railways, buses and airlines to decrease frequency of services and consider alternative seating to ensure social distancing. “Effective disinfection and crowd management be ensured in places like railway stations, Metro stations, bus stands, and airports,” the advisory said.

These flights must reach India before 1.31am IST on Monday, allowing a maximum travel time of 20 hours — good enough for even the longest non-stop to India which is San Francisco-Delhi at 16-17 hours. After 1.32 am Monday, no international commercial passenger aircraft will be allowed to disembark passengers, whether Indian or foreign, on Indian soil.

Passenger flights from abroad to India can resume from 5.30am IST on March 29, the DGCA circular said.

Apart from the travel restriction, the government also advised that children below 10 years of age and those above 65 years stay at home. “State governments shall issue appropriate directions so that all citizens above 65 (other than for medical assistance), except for public representatives or government servants or medical professionals, are advised to remain at home,” the advisory said.

The decisions were taken at a meeting of the group of ministers headed by health minister Harsh Vardhan. The health ministry reported 148 Indian nationals and 25 foreign nationals had tested positive for Covid-19 till 5 pm and this included 20 cured and four deaths.

The government directed Metros, railways, buses and airlines to decrease frequency of services and consider alternative seating to ensure social distancing. “Effective disinfection and crowd management be ensured in places like railway stations, Metro stations, bus stands, and airports,” the advisory said.

The government maintained that these were preventive measures and there was no evidence of community transmission so far. On Wednesday, TOI had reported out that of 820 random samples of people with influenza-like illness, there were no positives for Covid-19, indicating that community spread was not yet happening.

“These are all preventive steps. There is no reason for panic in the community. There is a need to be prepared. There is no community transmission but the community needs to take precautions,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.

The ministry said the department of pharmaceuticals and the ministry of consumer affairs had been asked to take action against anyone charging exorbitant prices for masks, sanitisers and other health-related materials.

To discourage unnecessary travel and to prevent the vulnerable category of senior citizens from undertaking unnecessary travel, concessional booking of all tickets except for patients, students and Divyangjan category for unreserved and reserved segment have been suspended form midnight of March 20.

Meanwhile, on March 21, air India Dreamliner with 236 capacity will go to Rome to evacuate Indians stranded there, civil aviation ministry said.

According to travel portal ixigo, the average one-way fare on London-Mumbai was Rs 32,219 on March 13 which shot up 34% to Rs 43,183 for March 20.
