PMCH, Dhanbad, starts Covid-19 tests
2020-04-12
Sindri: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday approved Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) in Dhanbad as a testing centre for Covid-19. Jharkhand will now have three testing centres.

Dhanbad deputy commissioner Amit Kumar said PMCH will begin testing samples from Saturday night. So far, samples collected were either sent to Rims in Ranchi or MGM in Jamshedpur.

Kumar said, “Covid-19 test at PMCH will not only ease out the pressure on the two centres of the state, but it would also enable the state government to increase its daily testing capacity. The district administration has also decided to start a dialysis centre at the sadar hospital here to provide relief to kidney patients. The new dialysis centre has been set up as the BCCL central hospital has been turned into a Covid-19 hospital and its kidney patients are finding it difficult to get the dialysis done during the lockdown.”
