Earlier, a 70-year-old Italian woman who recovered from Covid-19 was discharged on Tuesday afternoon. Her husband too has recovered from Covid-19 but is in the hospital for treatment of old lung-related ailments. Now the Jaipur student, who returned from Spain, is the only Covid-19 positive person in the state. He is still undergoing treatment at SMS hospital.

The 85-year-old patient was sent home late on Tuesday night, even though there is a discharge policy for Covid-19 issued by the Centre, which makes it mandatory to keep the patient for 14 days in isolation from the date of his recovery. “He stayed for four days in isolation in the hospital from the day he was declared free from Covid-19. However, his relatives insisted on taking him home. We took declaration that they will keep the patient in isolation at home for 14 days from day of recovery,” said a SMS hospital doctor.

The 85-year-old had returned from Dubai on February 28 along with his wife. But he started feeling unwell and on March 2, he went to a clinic near to his home. Since, he did not find much relief, he went to three private hospitals on March 8 and all of them allegedly refused to provide him treatment suspecting him to be a Covid-19 case. However, on March 9 around 3am, he was brought to SMS hospital, where doctors kept him in isolation. He was tested positive for the disease the next day. His report issued on March 15 was normal and the hospital’s doctors declared him cured from Covid-19 on the same day and shifted him from Isolation ward to the medical ICU for treatment of pre-existing chronic kidney failure, diabetes and hypertension.
