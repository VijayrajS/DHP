Agra: A 57-year-old constable, part of the anti-romeo squad at Kotwali police station, succumbed to what is being suspected as Covid-19 in S N Medical College, at around 10 am on Friday. Satish Chandra of Mainpuri was admitted on Thursday after he complained of breathlessness and anxiety.

Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police (city) Rohan Botre said, “His Covid-19 test report is awaited. However, as a precautionary measure, we have asked all cops who came in contact with him to stay in quarantine until further notice.”

Chandra was cremated following the Covid-19 protocol.

Meanwhile, a constable posted in Sikandra police station who was put in isolation after he tested corona positive, shared a video on social media, alleging poor condition of the isolation centre at Sharad Group of Institutions in Sikandara.

In the video, the constable claimed he has liver and heart ailments, but has been shifted to the quarantine-cum-isolation facility in the private college along NH-2, where there is no doctor or medical staff, and whose sanitation and hygiene is so poor that even a healthy person can get ill in just one day of stay. Furthermore, their meals, supplied in food packets, were being kept in the open under bright sunlight.

“I was unwell last night, but there was no doctor to see me. I have locked myself inside the room, as I fear my condition will deteriorate if the facilities at the isolation facility don’t improve,” he said in the video.

SP (city) Botre said, “After the video got viral, we visited the facility and found the allegations to be true. The revenue department has now been asked to take necessary steps to improve the condition of the facility.”
