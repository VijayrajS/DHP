2020-04-11
VIJAYAWADA: Demand for electricity in Andhra Pradesh fell to a six-year-low on Thursday, April 9 due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19.


Officials of AP discoms, during a video conference on Friday, informed energy secretary Nagulappali Srikanth that grid demand in the state plummeted to 127MU (million units) on Thursday, from 152 MU on April 8 (Wednesday), registering a steep fall of 25 MU.

The maximum demand in the state also fell from 8,100 MW to 6,400 MW on the same day. The maximum and minimum demands of the state during the day were 6,400 MW and 4,150 MW respectively. There is a difference of approximately 3,300 MW in the afternoon compared to the previous day’s demand, officials said.

“The demand usually goes up to 190 MU to 200MU in the summer season. But the demand is hovering around 150 MU to 160 MU per day as many companies, commercial establishments, and offices have shut down. This is the lowest demand noticed for the first time after Cyclone Hudhud struck Vizag in 2014,” officials said.

Explaining the reasons for the further fall in demand on Thursday, officials said that out of 1,500 feeders with 33KV capacity, nearly 80 broke down and out of 12,000 feeders of 11KV capacity, 276 broke down in Nellore, Kadapa and Machilipatnam due to strong winds and heavy rain. “The electricity staff and engineers worked till midnight and restored all feeders except three 33KV ones. The remaining works are under way,” a discom official said.

Meanwhile, due to the coronavirus pandemic and breakdown of feeders as well as reduced power consumption, the demand across the three discoms — APEPDCL, APCPDCL and APSPDCL — has declined considerably.

The situation has been brought to normal and demand started picking up from the early hours of Friday. The AP Genco stations on the other hand have been place under reserve shut down to stock coal for the summer season and this shortage is being tied up from exchange at very economical prices ranging from 1.95 to 2.15 per unit.

Energy secretary N Srikant said that the staff was working 24x7 to avoid inconvenience to consumers during critical times and ensure uninterrupted supply to hospitals.
