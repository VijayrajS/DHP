Salem: A 54-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday evening after he refused to undergo Covid-19 test. He has been lodged in the district prison in Attur.

The Mettur town police identified the arrested as S Kannan, 54, of Mettur. He is an engineer with a private firm.

A police officer said Kannan’s son was tested positive for the novel coronavirus a few days ago and admitted to the government hospital in the city.

Health department officials subsequently asked Kannan and his family to remain in home quarantine and took their blood samples and throat swab for test.

“When the officials approached them again for another test, Kannan denied them permission to enter the house. He also went to sub-collector’s office in the town and argued with the officials there,” a police official said.

Sub-collector’s office document writer Hari Shankar lodged a complaint with the Mettur town police, who registered a case and arrested Kannan. tnn
