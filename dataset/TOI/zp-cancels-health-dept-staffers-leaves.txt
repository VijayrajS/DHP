Coronavirus scare in Pune: Zilla Parishad cancels health department staffers leaves
2020-03-14
PUNE: Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad has cancelled the leaves of health department staffers for the next few days in the wake of the spurt in coronavirus cases.


Prasad said if the situation demands even the weekly offs of employees would be cancelled.

He said action would be taken against those missing from office. The Public Healthcare Centres (PHCs) are in special focus and the staff members have been asked to track patients who have visited the centre in the past one-and-a-half month. The probable cases will be identified, and their health checked. A control room has been set up at the tehsil office.

Prasad said, “Not a single employee of the health department will go on leave unless there is an emergency. Leaves of all health officials have been cancelled and this should be treated as an emergency situation. If any officer is found missing from work, action will be taken against him/her.”

Prasad has instructed all PHCs to prepare a localisation plan to contain the virus in their jurisdiction. The Asha workers have been instructed to conduct house-to-house surveys and note the travel history of residents from January, especially those with a travel history.
