Coronavirus outbreak: Students back from China under health department’s lens
2020-02-02
KRISHNAGIRI: Doctors are closely monitoring the nine students, who returned to their hometowns in the district from China on Friday evening, for any symptoms of coronavirus infection. 

Dr Govindan, deputy director of district health services, said health department officials had collected their blood samples as soon as they landed in Chennai airport on Thursday and that they were tested negative for the virus.

A team of doctors from the district, meanwhile, visited the students at their houses on Friday and Saturday and conducted a thorough check-up. “We will monitor them daily until they return to China,” Govindan said. 

While the students do not have any symptoms of coronavirus, they have been instructed not to go outside and mingle with others. “They should not move with others, especially with people suffering from fever and cold. They should also remain isolated at their houses,” the deputy director of district health services said. 

One of the students, M Chandrasekaran, 21, of Hosur, however, told reporters that there wasn’t any such panic in China as described in the media. “I was instructed to return to my college on February 21,” he said. He is pursuing fourth year medicine in China. 

The health department officials, meanwhile, appealed the public not to panic. “People should approach doctors at the earliest if they have cough and cold accompanied by high temperature,” an official said.
