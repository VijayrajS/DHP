Arjun Bijlani makes good use of lockdown and is up to one of his favourite activities that's cooking. In a chat with us, Arjun tells us about his favourite recipes straight from his kitchen that he's making on and off, during this period of lockdown.


Arjun Bijlani says, "In regular shoot days, I don't get to cook. But in these time of corona and complete lockdown, I am at home totally. I like to cook and spend time with wife Neha and son Ayan. Generally Neha and Ayan gets up around 9 in the morning and I am an early riser where I get up around 6-6:30 am. So that' the time when after working out, I step into the kitchen and prepare some of my favourite breakfast recipes. Recently, I made punjabi chole and sabuchana khichdi which was a big hit. Cooking is fun for me and also these days bai's are also not coming, so it's all the more opportunity to cook my own way."

Arjun also shared making scrambled eggs with grated cheese right from his kitchen with us. He finds it one of the healthiest and home-made breakfast items to have in the morning. He also shares his love for his mom's special poha, which he knows well how to cook.
