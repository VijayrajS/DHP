2020-03-26
AHMEDABAD: The Covid-19 vigilance team of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has asked the managing director of a Japanese company that manufactures specialised lubricants and adhesives based out of Sanand to go into home quarantine.


The Japanese national had landed in the city on March 19. Since the company official did not understand English, the AMC team contacted the HR division manager of the company and advised the official to immediately go into home quarantine. 

The vigilance team will keep a close eye on the official and will be paying regular visits at his residence, a senior AMC official told TOI.
