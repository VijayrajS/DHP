Coronavirus not spread via meat: Vijayawada poultry farmers
2020-02-18
VIJAYAWADA: Rumours about Coronavirus and bird flu have hampered the sale of chicken, fish, and meat across the city. The price of chicken has come down by Rs 40 per kilogram in the last ten days and poultry farmers are in a hurry to clear stocks available with them.


Videos blaming non-vegetarian foods—mainly chicken and other poultry—for the rapid spread of coronavirus have gone viral across the state. These videos have severely impacted the non-veg markets in the city. 

 
 

Mahanti Market, One Town market, Chuttugunta market and other non-vegetarian markets across the city wore a deserted look on Sunday. “Our sales have been down for about two weeks now. Residents are hesitating to buy chicken due to the fear of COVID-19 and bird flu. Sale of mutton and seafood have also come down. The state government should give clarity on the rumours being spread on social media,” said Sk Basha, a chicken trader from Chuttugunta.

Poultry farmers across Krishna and West Godavari districts are in a hurry to clear their stocks. In some areas, the live bird is being sold for Rs 50 per kilogram, due to a fear of the bird having a bird flu type of viral infection. “Rumours about bird flu destroyed the market. No wholesaler is coming forward to buy stocks from us. We are selling the birds at half price to save money on the feed,” said M Nagaraju, a poultry farmer from Bapulapadu mandal of Krishna district. 

“There are no traces of bird flu or other viral diseases in poultry in our region. We urge the government to help us,” he added. 

Meanwhile, physicians rubbished rumours about the spread of COVID-19 through the consumption of chicken and eggs. “Coronavirus was initially transmitted from bats, but it is not spreading through poultry or animals. One should ignore apprehensions about the spread of coronavirus through non-vegetarian food,” said Dr. V Bhagyaraj a city-based physician.
