2020-04-26
BAREILLY: The Uttar Pradesh government has approved a proposal seeking to set up bio-safety laboratories for Covid-19 test at the district hospital in Bareilly and government medical college in Budaun. 

At present, Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) conducts testing of human samples for Covid-19 collected from Bareilly and neighbouring districts.

Chief medical superintendent, district hospital, Bareilly, Dr TS Arya said, “The state government has given a nod for setting up of a bio-safety laboratory level 2 here for testing of samples for novel coronavirus. We have proposed to set up the lab at the old operation-theatre building here.” 

Dr RP Singh, principal, government medical college, Budaun, said, “After approving a bio-safety laboratory level-3 here, the state government also sanctioned a budget of Rs 4.5 crore on Friday. We will now invite tenders to select a firm that will set up the laboratory. It will take over a month for the laboratory to become functional.”

According to officials, once functional, these two laboratories will decrease the waiting time of the Covid-19 test reports. Like Bareilly, patients in Budaun will also be able to get the report the same day. Besides, the number of people being tested for Covid-19 will go up as well.
