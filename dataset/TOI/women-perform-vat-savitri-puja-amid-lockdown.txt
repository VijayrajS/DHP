Women perform Vat Savitri puja amid lockdown

PATNA: Dressed up in new saris and wearing ‘solah shringar’, a large number of married women observed Vat Savitri Puja on Friday morning. They wrapped cotton threads around the trunks of banyan trees and prayed for the well-being of their husbands.

According to city-based priest, Dhanesh Tiwari, the day is dedicated to Savitri, who brought her husband, Satyavan, back to life by her determination.

“Married women go to a nearby banyan tree along with a photo or idol of Goddess Savitri and other ‘puja samagri’. They wrap a red thread around the tree while reciting the Vat Savitri ‘vrat katha’ and seek the blessings of the elderly, especially their mothers-in-law,” Tiwari said and added that devotees also observe fast on the day and break it after seeing the full moon.

Those, who observed Vat Savitri Puja amid the Covid-19 lockdown, made sure that they took all precautionary measures. 

Saguna Mor resident, Ankita Sinha, performed the rituals with her sister-in-law near their house. “We celebrated the festival, but followed social distancing norms,” she claimed.

Kadamkuan resident Pritee Prasad thanked the government for allowing relaxations just before the festival. “Otherwise, I would not be able to buy the puja items that are required for observing the fast,” she said.

Meanwhile, the banyan tree near the Khajpura Shiv Temple, which used to be thronged by thousands of devotees on the occasion of Vat Savitri, wore a deserted look this year due to the lockdown. “Not more than 15 women performed the rituals here as the temple is closed,” said Tipu Singh, treasurer of the Shri Shri Khajpura Puja Samiti.
