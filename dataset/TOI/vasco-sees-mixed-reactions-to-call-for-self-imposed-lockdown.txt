Vasco: There was a mixed response on Saturday to the call given by Mormugao municipality’s chairperson for a voluntary lockdown in Vasco.

Mormugao Municipal Council’s (MMC) chief Nandadeep Raut on Friday had appealed to the citizens of Vasco to opt for a voluntary shutdown after Covid-19 cases were detected in other parts of Vasco town, besides the containment zone. Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida had also supported Raut’s demand for a lockdown

While many pulled down their shutters in the port town, others kept their businesses open, especially general stores and sweet marts. In Baina, New Vaddem and Sada general stores were open, while cloth stores, laundries and pharmacies were shut.

Vendors at the vegetable and fruit market said that they have decided to close down from Sunday evening and are giving time to Vascoietes to stock up. The president of Vasco Vegetable Market Committee, Prashant Naik, said, “There is absolutely no need for people to panic. We will close the markets but mobile vans will move around wards and there will be continuous supply of fruits and vegetable.”

When contacted, the Vasco MLA said that “people need time to prepare themselves for the self-imposed lockdown,” adding that the government should lockdown the port town.

Referring to the CM’s decision not to lockdown Vasco, vice-president of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Sankalp Amonkar said “Looks like he doesn’t want port activities to be hampered. Since lives are at risk, public health should be the priority.”
