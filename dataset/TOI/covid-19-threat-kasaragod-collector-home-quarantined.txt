Covid-19 threat: Kasaragod collector home quarantined
2020-04-30
KANNUR: Kasaragod district collector D Sajith Babu has gone into home quarantine after it was found that the TV journalist who tested positive for Covid-19 maintained contact with him. Officials said the driver and the gunman of the collector were also into home quarantine.

It was more than ten days back that this reporter met the collector as part of an interview, said the officials. Though there was no physical contact, a swab test would be done, they said.

It was on Wednesday that the journalist tested positive, but it is not clear from where he contracted the disease. Following this his primary contacts would be identified and quarantined, said the officials.

On April 28, a 24-year-old youth, who is a resident of Mavungal near Kanhangad, had tested positive. He had visited Coorg in the first week of March, but it is not sure whether he got the infection from there or from somewhere else.

“We are in the process of tracking his route map in an effort to identify his primary contacts, but it is very complicated,” said Dr AT Manoj, district surveillance officer.

However, as of now there is no fear of community transmission, said the officials.

Though 178 positive cases have been reported so far and 165 have already got discharged from the hospitals, they all had come from abroad or were their primary contacts. But these two cases are exceptions, which has caused concern among the people.
