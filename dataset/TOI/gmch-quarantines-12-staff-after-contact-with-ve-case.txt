GMCH quarantines 12 staff after contact with +ve case
2020-04-29
AURANGABAD: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has sent as many as 12 employees, including doctors, nurses and an intern, to the quarantine ward after they came in contact with a Covid-19 positive patient in the general ward.

The GMCH had turned its medicine building into a dedicated Covid Hospital in the first week of April. The facility is designated to care for Covid-19 suspect and positive cases that are critical in nature or require ventilator support. 

For this purpose, the GMCH had discharged or moved all other non-Covid patients from the medicine building to the surgical building. 

However, it has been observed that due to lack of management and instructions many patients are not being screened for Covid-19 before they are moved to a particular ward. This poses a threat of getting infected not only for the health staff, but also for other patients.

On Saturday, a 65-year-old woman from Qile Ark was initially admitted to the general ward of the hospital in the surgery building where a number of nurses, doctors and support staff came in contact with her. 

This woman later tested positive for Covid-19 after her throat swab sample was sent for testing. Following this, the hospital administration has quarantined the seven nurses, four resident doctors and an intern who came in contact with the patient in the quarantine facility.Arvind Gaikwad, nodal officer for media interaction at GMCH, told TOI that initially the woman was asymptomatic. "Later, when she started showing Covid-19 symptoms her swab sample was tested. The medical staff had exposure to the patient that is why they have been quarantined to be on a safer side," Gaikwad said. 

"Instructions have been issued to ensure that all suspected patients are moved to dedicated Covid Hospital in the medicine building and are kept there until they test negative for the virus," he added.
