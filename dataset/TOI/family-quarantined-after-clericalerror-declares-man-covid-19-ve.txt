Bijnor: It was a harrowing experience for an entire family. A 66-year-old Amroha-based man tested Covid-19 negative. However, in the consolidated report prepared by Moradabad administration, he was erroneously mentioned positive. The development resulted in the quarantining of eight members of his family.According to official sources, the man, a resident of Amroha's Nauganva Sadat town, was suffering from cold and sore throat and was admitted to a Moradabad hospital for treatment. His blood sample was collected and sent to Aligarh laboratory last week. The report arrived on Monday night. The Bijnor chief medical officer (CMO) later sought confirmation from the Aligarh lab and by Tuesday evening it turned out to be negative.Health department on Tuesday discharged the five members of the family.Amroha CMO Megh Singh said, "The test report of a Nauganva Sadat local was misprinted. As per the earlier report, he was shown Covid positive. Moradabad health department had provided his report to us. When we checked his history and took it up with Aligarh laboratory, the mistake which was made by staff while typing came to light.""We informed the Moradabad admin about it. The man who was shown positive in the report was later tested negative," Singh said.Meanwhile, nine people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Amroha district so far. Out of them, three belong to the same family.
