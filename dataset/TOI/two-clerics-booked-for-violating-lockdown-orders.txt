AURANGABAD: Two clerics have been booked by police in Aurangabad and Beed after more than four people were found gathered at the mosques.

The first offence was registered on Sunday in Aurangabad, while the second came to be registered in Ambejogai on Monday.

In the offence registered with the City Chowk police station, 64-year-old Maulana Habib Khan has been booked after he allegedly led prayers for a group of about two dozen people on Sunday evening.

The congregation was noticed by special branch sleuths following which a complaint was lodged by head constable Azimuddin Inamdar.

In Ambejogai of Beed district, 10 people had gathered for offering prayers at Fareed Madrassa Masjid Pensionpura following which the policemen belonging to the special branch alerted the area police station.

Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar said the police action is aimed at ensuring social distancing and effective implementation of the lockdown.

“Stepping out of your house, without any valid reason, is itself a violation of the lockdown orders. There are specific instructions to people from across all communities to abstain from gathering for any kind of social or religious events,” he said.

The suspects have been booked under section 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by government authorities), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the IPC along with section 51-B of National Disaster Management Act. Meanwhile, around 58 people were booked by city police on Tuesday for violating lockdown orders.
