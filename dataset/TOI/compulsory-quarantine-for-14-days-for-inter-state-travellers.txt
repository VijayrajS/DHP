MYSURU: District minister S T Somashekar stepped up efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus by directing the Mysuru district administration to compulsorily quarantine inter-state travellers for 14 days, who are arriving in Mysuru, on Sunday.

Though the district administration had mandated it, and quarantined over 1,000 travellers, the government asked it not to do it. Now with the minister’s directive, those who are coming to Mysuru from other states and abroad, will be compulsorily quarantined for two weeks. Somashekar said that he had directed the district administration to adopt strict measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

“As a precautionary measure, people coming from other states and abroad, to the district, should be compulsorily quarantined for 14 days,” he said. Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar said the directive will be followed by the district administration.

He has also asked the district administration to set up a different team to take care of senior citizens. “Special attention should be given to children and the elderly. A separate team should be formed to monitor the elderly. Social distancing and cleanliness should be given utmost importance,” he said.

Somashekar also directed the authorities to conduct surprise inspections of factories which have started production in the district, and check whether they are following all the norms and directions prescribed by the government in fighting Covid-19.

“Mysuru, which was in the red zone with 90 positive cases, now has just four positive cases. In the next one week, there will be no positive cases in the district,” he said, appreciating the work done by the district administration, police and health and ASHA workers, in controlling the virus.
