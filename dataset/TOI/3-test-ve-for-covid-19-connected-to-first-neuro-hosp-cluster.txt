2020-05-10
MANGALURU: Even as health authorities are scrambling to find answers on who P-0 is, as far as the First Neuro Hospital cases are concerned, three more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada on Saturday. The trio were primary contacts of P-578, a 69-year-old man from Kasba village in Bantwal taluk, who in turn was a primary contact of P-390, the first victim of Covid-19 in the district. P-390 is among the three people who succumbed to Covid-19 in the district.

P-390 was the daughter-in-law of P-432. P-432 was treated at First Neuro Hospital in Padil. The hospital has been designated a supervised isolation centre. While P-390 died on April 19, P-432 died four days later. District health authorities maintain that P-390 had visited the hospital on April 2 to inquire about her mother-in-law’s health, and could have contracted the disease there.

Saturday’s positive cases are all members of a family, who are related to P-390, and lived in the same neighbourhood in Kasba village. Designated P-777, P-778 and P-779 in the state bulletin issued at 12pm on Saturday, P-777 is a man aged 30, P-778 is a woman aged 60 and P-779 is a woman aged 70. P-578, who tested positive on May 1, is being treated at Wenlock Hospital, the designated Covid-19 hospital for Dakshina Kannada.

Eight family members of P-578 were quarantined after the 69-year-old tested positive, and three of them have tested positive for Covid-19. The three patients who tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, as well as the 14 other patients afflicted by the disease, can be traced back to P-390, and her link to First Neuro Hospital. With this, the total active cases in the district has gone up to 15, and a total 25 people in the district have been afflicted by Covid-19 so far. Six people from outside the district were successfully treated for the disease here, and discharged.
