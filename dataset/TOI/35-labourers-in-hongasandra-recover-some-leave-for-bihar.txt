2020-05-19
BENGALURU: The residents of Hongasandra area, which had been sealed for the last 25 days after 35 people tested positive for Covid-19, will be relieved if no case is reported in the next three days. 

All the 35 patients have recovered and some of them have started returning to their home state, Bihar. As on Monday, 206 recovered persons and their primary and secondary contacts returned to Bihar by trains. The spotlight was on Hongasandra after a labourer from Bihar got infected; the source is still not clear. 

Dr Suresh GK, medical officer, Bommanahalli, said the authorities responded swiftly to curb the spread of the virus. “The first case was reported on April 21 and 256 migrant labourers were quarantined immediately. Though none tested positive in the first test, later the cases started to report. By then, all the primary and secondary contacts were under quarantine which helped make Hongasandra a Covid-free area now. Also, police sealed down the area in no time and BBMP and the labour department provided the workers with ration,” he said. 

Officials said the people in the locality followed rules which also yielded results.

BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said the migrants, who were the primary contacts, were quarantined in a hotel and could leave if they tested negative twice.
