Pilibhit: In order to control the spread of Covid-19, the district unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday decided to suspend the OPD services at private nursing homes, clinics and hospitals owned by IMA associated doctors with immediate effect.The IMA doctors would, however, tend to emergency cases.A letter in this reference was issued jointly by IMA’s district president, Dr Tarun Sethi and secretary, Dr Deepak Gangwar.“Our decision is in compliance with the state government’s directions. We feel that around 9,000 to 10,000 patients, who were being served by 80 private medical institutions of IMA doctors in district, may face difficulty due to suspension of OPD services, but we will be serving the nation by averting the gathering of thousands of people in a bid to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus at the same time”, said Dr Deepak Gangwar.
