Virus screenings take hit as test kits stuck in China
2020-04-16
JAIPUR: The state government’s strategy of aggressive screening, testing and quarantine of suspects to prevent spread of Covid-19 in Jaipur’s Ramganj and other hotspots in the state suffered a setback as the rapid test kits ordered by the state were still pending at a port in China.

 Meanwhile, a report from Delhi said India will finally receive the first consignment of rapid testing kits by this week with one consignment of 3,00,000 kits being cleared by customs in Guangzhou on Wednesday and headed to Delhi on Thursday, said official sources. Over the next couple of weeks, India is expected to receive about 2-3 million kits from China. 

“Not only the kits ordered by Rajasthan but by the central government are also pending at a China port,” said chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday. The state government had ordered 10 lakh kits and was expecting the first tranche of 2 lakh soon. But the consignment has not yet been dispatched. Since the central government had also put its order from China, there is no way the state could arrange test kits from the Centre either. 

The state has been focusing on testing, isolating and quarantining the suspects as a strategy to control the pandemic in congested areas like Ramganj. 

Sources in the state government said in Ramganj, which is now the nerve centre of Corona, the administration has decided that if space is available at the residences of suspects or relatives of corona positives, they will be allowed home quarantine.

“The officials have been busy identifying buildings to quarantine people living in the old city areas, as home quarantines are virtually ineffective in this congested locality,” said an official.

The chief minister said, “We are making arrangements to accommodate about 20,000 people in quarantine centres in Jaipur.”
