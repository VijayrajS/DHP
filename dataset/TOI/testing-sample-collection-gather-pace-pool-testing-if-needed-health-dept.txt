2020-04-19
DEHRADUN: Alleging that both sample collection and testing have gathered pace in the state, health officials released the reports of 274 Covid-19 samples on Saturday, the highest ever in a single day since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. 


According to health officials, 330 samples were collected on Saturday, again a first ever in a single day. Keeping in mind the rising number of cases, the health department is now mulling pool testing to ramp up detection of cases.

Talking to TOI, additional secretary (health) Yugal Kishore Pant said that both collection of samples and testing have increased in the state. “We have collected around 150-300 samples daily in the last week and received reports of around 100-150 every day. There was some backlog mid-week but with 274 new reports on Saturday, we have cleared most of it. With 76 pending reports and 330 new samples collected, we are awaiting the results of 406 persons,” he added. He further said that the guidelines for pool testing have been shared with the laboratories in the state. Meanwhile, a government doctor at a Covid-19 facility said that the testing needs to keep pace with the sample collection.“The rate of sample collection has increased drastically in the last 10 days but reporting has not kept pace. It will be difficult to assess the situation if the reports remain pending for long,” he added.

The health department on Saturday notified Dehradun as red zone, Nainital and US Nagar as orange zones, Haridwar, Pauri and Almora as blue zones and Uttarkashi, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Pithoragarh and Bageshwar as green zones.
