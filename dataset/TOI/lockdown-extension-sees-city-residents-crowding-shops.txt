2020-04-15
MADURAI: Vegetable markets and grocery stores were crowded than usual on Tuesday as residents resorted to a panic buying after the lockdown was extended.


Residents said that while they have essentials they had purchased earlier, they wanted to stock up certain items like dal, sugar, rice and oil as a precaution. There was also a general fear of price of essentials going up making the people indulge in panic buying. 

“I got only half-a-month’s salary, which I have already spent it on essential items. I borrowed some money from my relative to make my purchase today (Tuesday),” V Alagumalaiyan, a hotel employee said.

Residents said that many grocery stores are still closed, while most bigger ones operate. Shops will not be crowded if all of them are open. “Only one shop in my area is open. Many items were not available. I was forced to come to Anna Nagar to purchase essentials required for a month,” J Kayalvizhi, a resident of Anupanadi said.

Police personnel deployed at junctions, allowed people to buy essentials till 10am. Those who were found wandering after that were stopped and asked to give reasons. Similarly, those who travelled without wearing any masks were asked to return home. A police officer from Anna Nagar station said that although they have been insisting of wearing masks while coming out of the house to ensure safety, many, especially the elderly and women venture out without a mask.
