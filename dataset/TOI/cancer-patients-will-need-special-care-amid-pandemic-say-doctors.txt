VISAKHAPATNAM: Cancer patients need special care during the coronavirus outbreak, say oncologists, as they are already immune-suppressed. Consequently, cancer treatment centres in the city are taking special measures.

Discussing some of the measures being taken, Dr Muralikrishna Voonna, MD of Mahatma Gandhi Cancer Hospital and Research Institute said, “Any ultra-radical surgery that requires multiple blood transfusions should be delayed now if alternative form of treatment can be instituted interim.

“Scheduling of patients should be such that overcrowding can be avoided in the radiation therapy department. Laparoscopic and robotic surgeries are to be discouraged,” he said.

Dr Voonna added, “In medical oncology, immunosuppressive chemo can be changed to non-immuno suppressive treatment and chemo therapy should be changed to long duration intervals. Wherever possible, palliative chemo can be changed to oral chemo therapy and some adjuvant chemotherapies can be postponed for few more weeks.” 

Dr D Raghunadha Rao, former director of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre said that those on chemotherapy must take extra care with social isolation and personal protection.

“The need of the hour is to reduce the number of radiation fractions, while increasing the dose per fraction. Also, oral drugs are preferred to intravenous drugs,” Dr Rao said.
