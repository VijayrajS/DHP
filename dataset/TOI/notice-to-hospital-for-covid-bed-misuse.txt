Notice to hospital for Covid bed misuse
2020-06-06
Ahmedabad: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Friday issued a show-cause notice to Artham Hospital, which was notified as a Covid hospital by the civic body on May 16. The hospital was recently found to be admitting patients privately and charging them while giving them beds meant for Covid-19 patients referred by the AMC. The notice also mentioned that the management of Artham Hospital had cited non-availability of beds, when a Covid-19 patient was supposed to be shifted there from SVP Hospital.

According to the agreement signed between the AMC and the hospital management, 50% of the 90 beds at the hospital were to be reserved for Covid-19 patients admitted by the civic body; while the hospital management could admit patients separately on the remaining 50% of beds and charge them accordingly.

Over suspicions of alleged irregularities, when an AMC representative visited the hospital on Wednesday, it was found that six patients were admitted privately on beds earmarked for patients sent by the AMC and they were charged as well. Upon further investigation it was found that a total of 51 such patients were admitted privately, at their own expense.

“The charges for the beds that remain empty under the AMC’s quota of beds are taken from the AMC. Moreover, the same beds are used to admit patients privately and these patients are also charged. This is a deliberate attempt by the hospital to admit patients privately on beds allotted for patients to be admitted by AMC. This is a very serious matter and is in violation of the Epidemic Diseases Act and cannot be tolerated,” stated the show-cause notice issued to the hospital.

According to a report by a department representative, when the patient from SVP Hospital was denied admission, 29 beds of those allotted to AMC and 19 of those under private admissions were found to be vacant. This is in clear violation of the agreement signed by the private hospital with the AMC.

The civic authorities have asked the hospital management to state why its registration should not be cancelled. The notice also asked the hospital to explain why 10-times the charge levied by the hospital on privately admitted patients in beds allotted to AMC, should not be charged as a penalty and why a police complaint under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code should not be filed against the hospital. The civic authorities have asked for a response from the hospital within a day.
