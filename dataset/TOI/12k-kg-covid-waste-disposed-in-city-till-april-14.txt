Indore: Indore with highest number of Covid-19 patients in the state has incinerated over 12,000 kg of hazardous biomedical waste, according to Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. 

According to the data released by regional PCB after conducting inspections of hospitals, isolation wards and quarantine centres, around 12,559 kg of Covod-19 bio medical waste has been collected and incinerated as on April 14. 

PCB regional officer R K Gupta said, “As Covid-19 patients are increasing, biomedical waste is growing. We are regularly inspecting all centres to keep a close eye on collection and disposal of bio medical waste. Close to 12,559 kg of waste has already been disposed of scientifically in the incinerator.” 

On Wednesday, a team of officials from regional PCB office conducted inspection at Gokuldas hospital, Vishesh hospital, Index Medical College, Suyash hospital and Prashanti hospital among a few other quarantine centres to check collection and storage of biomedical waste. 

These hospitals were found collecting biomedical waste in yellow bin as directed by Central Pollution Control Board guideline and waste was sent to the incinerator facility. 

The inspection team suggested hospitals to dispose hazardous waste such as PPE kits, masks and other discarded items in double layer yellow bags to avoid any probability of spreading infection from discarded medical supplies. 

Looking at the increasing waste, additional vehicles have been deployed for collection and transportation of biomedical waste. A total of 5 vehicles have been designated in the city to collect bio medical waste from various sources, said pollution control board.
