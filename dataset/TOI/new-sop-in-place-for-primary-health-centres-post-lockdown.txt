2020-05-24
HYDERABAD: A person cannot walk into a primary health centre (PHC) without a mask and sanitising his/her hands on entering the premises is mandatory, according to a new set of guidelines issued by the state health department for containing Covid-19 post the lockdown.

Not allowing spitting in public places, including PHC premises, regularly disinfecting thermometer, BP machine and stethoscope as well as mandatory sanitising of hands by PHC staff and doctors after coming in contact with a patient are among other mandatory measures issued in the order on Saturday, detailing the post lockdown strategy across Telangana.

 It also stressed on the need for co-ordinated efforts of various departments to control the spread in urban areas and GHMC limits. 

Also, surveillance would be continued in all erstwhile containment zones and all hospitals, both private and government, have been mandated to report cases of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases to the ‘ebirth and notifiable diseases portal’. 

“All SARI cases should be tested for Covid-19,” it said.

At PHCs, the order mandates, disinfection of all surfaces should be done at least twice a day with 1% sodium hypochlorite. 

Ambulances transporting suspected Covid-19 patients should be disinfected after every visit. Biomedical waste management should be done scrupulously with specific focus on disposal of protective gear, it added.

For surveillance, ASHA workers and ANMs have been asked to monitor fever and influenza like illness (ILI) cases at field level and medical officers have to alert district health officers in the instance of a spurt in the number of cases. 

“Migrant workers have to stay in mandatory home quarantine for 14 days and will be followed by ANM and ASHA workers. In case of symptoms, they have to be tested,” the order said.
