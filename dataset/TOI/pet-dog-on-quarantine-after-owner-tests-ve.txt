THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The animal husbandry department has kept a dog in home quarantine after its owner tested positive for Covid-19. 


The Pathanamthitta district administration noticed the one-and-a-half-year-old Indie while preparing the contact list of its owner, a 27-year-old man, who had returned home from Dubai on March 22. He was since quarantined at home in Airoor panchayat. The man tested positive on April 8. 

Health officials, who prepared contact list, was told that the dog, called Appu, had closely mingled with the youth.

“The family comprises the father, mother and a younger brother, who are in home quarantine. Though we have quarantined the dog, it is in its natural habitat and not strictly in a kennel,” Dr Oommen P Raj, deputy director, Animal Husbandry, Pathanamthitta, said. The family and health workers checking on the quarantined people have been instructed to observe the dog for symptoms such as fever, nasal discharge, dullness or anorexia. “Currently, the dog is healthy and shows no symptoms,” Dr Raj said. Officials said though there has been no case of the virus getting transmitted from pets to humans, the dog has been quarantined as a precautionary measure.

“Some local residents raised concerns after a tiger in a New York zoo was tested positive for Covid 19,” the official said. After discussions, the department decided to conduct tests only if the dog showed any symptoms. There are only three institutions—in Bhopal, Hisar, and Bareilly—to conduct Covid-19 test on animals in the country. “If there are any such symptoms, swabs will be sent to the national institute of high-security animal diseases in Bhopal, the nearest of the three,” the official said.

Officials have also prepared a list of 427 domestic animals and birds in houses of persons either tested positive or on home quarantine. 

Incidentally, a three-year-old Indian Spitz at Deonar in Mumbai suburb was released to its owners after two weeks of quarantine. The dog was quarantined after the death of its caretaker, a 65-year-old woman.
