Yale prof warns over handling of coronavirus cases

Bhopal: Yale professor Joseph Vinetz, ly an expert on how infectious disease spread, has raised an alarm about the way suspected Coronavirus patients are being handled in India. 

A visiting faculty at PGI Chandigarh, Prof Vinetz said: “WHO, CDC scientists are extremely concerned about suspected Coronavirus patients being discharged without molecular tests in densely populated countries like India. Neither molecular tests nor the complete WHO and CDS protocols of testing are being followed. The patients could be a great danger to the community at large.”

The internationally renowned expert explained: “The new Coronavirus seems to have become stable in humans and the spread of cases reflects this new adaptation to humans.” 

At this point, it’s fair to say that this (mutation) probably happened at the time that this virus jumped from whichever animal sources to humans.

“The best strategy is to wash hands well and to stay away from crowded places for a few weeks,” said Prof Vinetz.

Experts indicate at the possibility of mutation of coronavirus in a student at Ujjain, where the suspected patient’s mother was also treated for viral influenza. The MP health department is also directed for surveillance of suspected Coronavirus family members for any mutation. Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. “We usually do not diagnose most of the viruses. India needs easily available diagnostics facilities,” said Prof Vinetz.

The only way to diagnose Coronavirus is extensive molecular-based testing. Blood test will not be helpful. Molecular test on serum sample or swab from back of the nose is tested in reference laboratory, he said. Molecular tests are generally are not available (in India), except in highly specialized reference laboratories, he added.
