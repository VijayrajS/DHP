MEERUT: All UP roadways buses in Meerut were sanitised on Monday in the backdrop of coronavirus scare. All the buses were sanitised both from inside and outside to ensure that infection of any kind is not spread among the public.


“At a time when cases of coronavirus are on the rise and chances of getting infected by travelling by public transport looks like a huge risk, we have started disinfecting UP roadways buses to make sure that the locals do not fear travelling in these buses,” said Neeraj Saxena, Meerut regional manager, UPSRTC.

This comes at a time when the government authorities have instructed that all public places be disinfected to make sure that the situation remains under control and the disease is contained.

“We have purchased disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide and water to create a mixture, which is being used as a disinfectant. The sanitation workers – otherwise responsible for cleaning of the buses – have been given this task,” said Saxena.

Special care is also being taken of the buses which return after making trips to Delhi. Every time, a bus reaches the workshop, it is being disinfected to ensure a safe travel for passengers, he added.
