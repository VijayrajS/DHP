Covid-19 scare: Mumbai short on ventilators, say doctors
2020-03-07
MUMBAI: Even as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has asked all countries to stock up on ventilators because “oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe COVID-19,” BMC officials said the city has adequate infrastructure for any health emergency.


The Chinese experience in Wuhan showed 14% of patients had severe symptoms such as pneumonia and 5% become critically ill. Around 6% needed non-invasive or invasive ventilators. The BMC’s 60-bedded quarantine facility at Kasturba Hospital has merely four invasive and four non-invasive ventilators.

Critical care specialists told TOI the city would need thousands of ventilators in case of an outbreak. Intensivist Dr Prakash Jiandani worked out a figure of 1,500 for 1% of the city’s 1.4 crore population. A BMC doctor said all the ventilators in public and private hospitals would not be enough. Dr Dilip Mathai of Clinical Infectious Diseases Society of India is optimistic though. “Not all will need ventilators at the same time.” BMC additional municipal commissioner S Kakani said, “We can move ventilator beds to the quarantine facility if needed.”
