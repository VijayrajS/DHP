Identify land for last rites of Covid patients: Banna to districts
2020-04-15
JAMSHEDPUR: State health minister Banna Gupta on Tuesday directed all the deputy commissioners (DCs) to identify land in their respective jurisdictions where Covid-19 casualties can be either cremated or buried. The move comes after protests erupted in Ranchi when the administration tried to bury the body of a 60-year-old Hindpiri man who died of coronavirus on Sunday.

Banna said, “I have asked all the districts to identify land for cremation and burial and have also asked the administrations to keep separate ambulances to ferry deceased Covid-19 victims. Once the land are identified, it will be the first-of-its-kinds in the country.”

Banna agreed that finding land for setting up a separate burial/cremation ground is not easy, but said, “Where there is a will, there is way. There are lots of land outside towns and villages which are barren and can be used for this purpose.”

He added, “Steps are also being taken to create separate mortuaries for keeping bodies of Covid-19 casualties.” The minister also said that Jharkhand is not a very rich state, but these steps will help in the fight the virus and other states can also follow them.

Answering to whether funds will be made available for these steps as withdrawals from the state coffers have been stopped, Banna said, “Funds will be channelized from the disaster management department.”

Banna, who is heading the four-member state cabinet team formed to assist chief minister Hemant Soren to handle the crisis, expressed confidence that these initiatives will receive the cabinet’s nod too.
