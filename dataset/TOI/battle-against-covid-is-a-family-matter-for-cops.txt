Battle against Covid is a family matter for cops

Vadodara: The battle against coronavirus has become a family matter for the police in Vadodara. While the men are on the field risking lives to protect others from spread of the virus, their wives and sisters are saving lives, their own way. These women from families of cops posted in the city have come together to make face masks at the city police headquarters in Pratapnagar.

Saroj Kumari, DCP (crime) told TOI: “The women gather in the afternoon for a few hours and stitch masks from cotton cloth. These masks are then distributed to the policemen or common citizens. Our entire police force is out on the roads, manning the roads and keeping citizens indoors during the lockdown. Their dedication inspired the family members to contribute in the battle against coronavirus.” About 15 such women make about 500 masks daily and hand these over to the police department. 

“I see my husband giving his best in the battle against the virus daily. Therefore, I too decided to contribute in my own way. The masks we make save lives of both the cops as well as the needy people. This is our way of giving it back to the society. We will bring in more women in the coming days,” said Jyoti Patel, wife of police constable, Nilesh Patel, posted in the city police station.

The women spend nearly five hours everyday making the masks. They take all precautions including using sanitizers, gloves and maintaining social distance. “We need masks in large numbers and hence these women will continue making face masks in the coming days,” the DCP added.
