Mathew Varghese, a resident of Thottapuzha in Eraviperoor grama panchayat in Pathanamthitta, has become an inspiration to the society. Though there has been no emergency situation in the village, the move has come as a relief for authorities. 

At present, no Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in this area though 45 are under observation. According to Rajeev N, panchayat vice-president, the home is in the perfect location to set up an isolation ward as it is in the middle of a five-acre land. Even during floods in 2018 and 2019, Varghese had converted his house into a relief camp. 

However, some people had objected to Varghese’s decision of converting his house into an isolation ward fearing disease spread. “Some people complained about it. But I convinced them that it would not affect anyone. It’s a relief to get an isolation room in this locality itself,” Rajeev said.

Mathew Varghese, a Gulf returnee, is settled with his family in Thiruvananthapuram. He often comes to this village and stays in his home. “This is an isolated place. Since the Corona is almost like a national disaster I offered my willingness to convert my house into an isolation home to the panchayat vice-president,” he said.
