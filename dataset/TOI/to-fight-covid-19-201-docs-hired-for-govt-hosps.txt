DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand Medical Service Selection Board recruited 201 doctors for several government hospitals across the state on Tuesday. The recruitment is meant to strengthen healthcare services of the state in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.


Confirming the hiring of doctors, National Health Mission director Yugal Kishore Pant told TOI that all the new appointees have been allotted nearest centres so that they can join their service immediately. “These new doctors will surely help in strengthening the healthcare system in government sector. We are also planning more appointments in the days to come,” said Pant.

The recruitments come a week after CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had announced that doctors can be hired for government medical institutions through walk-in interviews. Incidentally, the newly recruited doctors were working on an ad-hoc basis in different facilities till now. 

The state, at present, has around 3000 sanctioned posts for doctors but only 1600 doctors are permanent appointees. In a response to an RTI query filed by Haldwani-based activist Hemant Guaniya in August 2019, the state government had stated that Uttarakhand has just 48 gynaecologists against 171 sanctioned posts, 60 child specialists against 140 sanctioned posts, 53 pathologists against 146 sanctioned posts, 37 eye surgeons against 137 sanctioned posts, five skin specialists against five sanctioned posts, 33 general surgeons against 134 sanctioned posts, 40 orthopaedic surgeons against 101 sanctioned posts, and 37 radiologists against 137 sanctioned posts.

Meanwhile, the health department on Tuesday received Covid-19 test reports of 63 patients and all were found negative. On the day, 35 new samples were sent for test. The state has quarantined 9,650 people in the last 15 days and has tested 513 suspected patients for the disease so far.
