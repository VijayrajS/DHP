2020-04-15
JAIPUR: Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot while supporting the extension of the lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said increasing incidents of Covid-19 was a matter of concern and social distancing was the only solution to break the chain.


But he said the state governments should have been given freedom to impose the lockdown according to local conditions. He said for instance the prevailing condition in the Northeastren states was entirely different from southern states. “The respective state governments thus should be allowed to outline the implementation of the lockdown according to local conditions,” he added.

He added that, “We are starting random testing and kits are being imported from outside. The focus is to strengthen the health infrastructure. Provisions for treatment in each district headquarters have been made,” he said.

Talking to journalists on Tuesday, he said, “We are doing a lot of sampling and testing unlike many states. So we are getting the real picture.” He said Ramganj area in Jaipur is very congested and social distancing has been not very effective. “But since curfew is imposed, no one is allowed to go inside or come out,” he added. 

He said the mortality rate is comparatively less and those who take timely treatment recover without any complications. He asked people to get tested and go for treatment without any inhibitions. “I request people to voluntarily come forward undergo testing and screening,” said Pilot.
