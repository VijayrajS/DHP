Cong ex-legislator opens his resort to MLAs, booked for lockdown violations
2020-06-08
Former Congress MLA from Rajkot Indranill Rajyaguru was booked on Sunday for “violating” Gujarat government’s lockdown order by opening his resort here to house five party legislators to shield them from any possible poaching attempt by BJP ahead of Rajya Sabha elections, scheduled to be held on June 19. During the ongoing Lockdown 5.0, hotels and resorts were ordered to remain shut till Sunday. 


These establishments are likely to reopen on Monday. After three MLAs resigned from the party ahead of the RS elections, Congress shifted its 65 legislators to three resorts in Rajkot, Ambaji and Anand to keep them away from ‘poaching’ by BJP. Along with Rajyaguru, Samarth Mehta, the manager of Neelcity Resort and Club, was also booked.
