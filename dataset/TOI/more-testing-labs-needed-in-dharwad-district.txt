More testing labs needed in Dharwad district
2020-04-15
Dharwad: In view of increasing suspected Covid-19 cases and lack of facilities to conduct virology tests, the district administration is making efforts to set up more laboratories and hire laboratory technicians and other experts.

Deputy commissioner Deepa Cholan said medical devices and equipment at Karnatak University will be used to conduct tests. The facilities at the Karnatak Institute of DNA Research will also be utilized, she said. Deepa said that more labs and human resources are needed since KIMS is the only testing lab in North Karnataka.

Experts say the process of Covid-19 testing involves three phases. In the first phase, RNA is extracted from swab or blood sample by using specific kits and chemicals. The second involves its conversion into Complimentary DNA (C-DNA). In the third, C-DNA is run with the help of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RtPCR) machine. It gives amplification only if the result is positive.
