Wedding industry hit hard by pandemic
2020-04-26
An auspicious day for weddings, Akha Teej or Akshaya Tritiya, is doomed by coronavirus this year. Falling on Sunday, the day will not be witnessing any wedding event due to the lockdown and prohibition on assembling of more than five persons at a place. The virus has ruined the business of caterers, wedding gardens, tent houses as well as service providers like beauticians, band companies, florists, photographers, safa (turban) sellers, costume sellers and pandits.

 Ghanshyam Mehra, who owns a shop selling torans, said that usually there is a huge demand for torans on Akshaya Tritiya, especially from rural areas. “But the entire material we had prepared considering the demand on Akha Teej is just wasted,” said Mehra, pointing to the rack of torans lying tattered in a corner of his shop near Ghantaghar.

Amri Devi’s concerns are no different. She sells traditional earthen pots for rituals of wedding at Akhaliya Circle. “I usually sell 200 sets of pots on Akha Teej. But there is no demand at all this time. This has dealt a reasonable monetary blow to many like us, who wait for big sales on this day,” she said. 

A pandit, Sunil Dutt Vashisth, who solemnises approximately 7-8 weddings on this day is sitting idle this time. “I stand to lose about Rs 1 lakh this year as there are no weddings taking place due to the lockdown and fear of virus,” Vashisth said.
