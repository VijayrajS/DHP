2020-03-24
COIMBATORE: With the state government imposing Section 144 from 6pm on Tuesday till March 31, grocery stores and vegetable shops in the city witnessed panic buying. The government also ordered that all food establishments, including hotels, restaurants and bakeries, to remain shut, however, allowing Amma Unavagams and food delivery aggregators like Swiggy and Zomato to function.


Though the government clarified that grocery stores will remain open during the period, people started buying goods fearing that the supply chain of grocers would be disrupted. “I am buying vegetables, fruits and groceries needed for two weeks. Usually I shop once a week before. I don’t know whether the situation will improve or worsen after March 31,” said Kamala Ravi, a housewife, at a grocery store in R S Puram. 

Many people were seen filling their push carts with ready to eat products. “Families in my apartment have decided to ask maids and cooks not to visit during the period. We don’t want to let any outsiders as they might not be as careful as us,” said Meghna Gupta, a resident of Peelamedu. “With buses cancelled, they may anyway not be able to turn up now,” she added.

Several grocery shops closed early since shelves were running out of vegetables, fruits and other essentials.
