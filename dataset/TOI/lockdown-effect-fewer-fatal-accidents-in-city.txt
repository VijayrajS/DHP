Lockdown effect: Fewer fatal accidents in city
2020-05-16
Nashik: The lockdown owing to Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant drop in fatal road accidents in the first four months of this year compared with last year.

As against 63 road fatalities registered between January and April 2019, this year 45 people died in road accidents during the same period. Fatalities on the city roads have thus dropped by 29% this year. 

Police officials said the 45 deaths are from 149 road accidents, in which 113 people escaped with serious injuries. 

Officials added that there were hardly any vehicles on the roads in April, which saw only 12 accidents that claimed five lives and left six others seriously injured. 

Senior police officials of the city traffic branch said that the barricades and heavy police presence on roads had an impact on the speed of vehicles too.

On an average, there are 13 to 18 fatal accidents in the city every month, with rash driving being the main cause of them.

The police have appealed to motorists not to indulge in rash driving on the empty roads during the evening and night hours for their own safety and safety of others on the road.
