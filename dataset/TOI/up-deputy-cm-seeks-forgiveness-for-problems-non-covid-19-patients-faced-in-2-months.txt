2020-06-03
MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Tuesday stopped short of apologizing for the problems which non-Covid-19 patients faced during the last two months, and said a plan of action is being readied to make sure that not only the government but private hospitals also admit patients with critical diseases.

Scores of non-Covid-19 patients have died across the state during the lockdown allegedly after private hospitals denied them treatment. Most of the nursing homes asked for Covid-19 report and said they will only admit those who are negative.

“I can feel the pain of the non-Covid-19 patients who have faced problems. And I seek forgiveness from them. Some steps were taken only to protect them because the majority of those who have died of Covid-19 had a history of other critical diseases,” said Maurya in a video press conference conducted for Meerut on the completion of one year of BJP government at the Centre.

“A plan of action is being prepared and it will soon reach the districts in containment zones. The plan will ensure that not only government but private hospitals are able to cater to the patients with critical diseases,” the deputy CM said.

Asked about a recent incident in Meerut’s LLRM Medical College where a monkey snatched blood samples of Covid-19 positive patients from a lab technician, Maurya said, “This was a rare case which nobody could have foreseen. However, the opposition tweeting against this matter only decreases the morale of the doctors, pathologists and nursing staff.”

Asked about why sampling of not even 1% of the state’s population has been done, he said, “It is impossible to conduct sampling of everybody in the entire state and the number is low because we are focusing on symptomatic cases.”

Maurya also said that efforts are being made to provide jobs to migrants in various sectors.
