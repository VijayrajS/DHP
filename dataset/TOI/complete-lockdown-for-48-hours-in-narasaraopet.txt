NARASARAOPET: With sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, the Guntur district administration enforced a 48-hour total lockdown in the town from Wednesday.

With 26 new positive cases reported on Wednesday, Narasaraopet has a total of 101 Covid-19 patients. The first case, however, was reported two weeks ago.

Most of the cases have been reported from Varavakatta and Ramireddythota colonies. The residents in these areas are worried about getting infected since they are staying in small houses.

“We have decided to enforce the 48-hour lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus to rural areas in the district. The movement of positive suspects to other areas in the district has resulted in cases in those areas,” said rural district SP Vijaya Rao.

He said no one from Narasaraopet town would be allowed to move out till Friday morning. He said all the check posts at the entry and exit points of Narasaraopet have been strengthened to prevent unnecessary movement of people.

Additional police forces have been deployed in Narasaraopet to enforce the lockdown. Special teams have been deputed to track and trace the sources of positive cases. A private cable-network technician from Varavakatta area was the first victim of Covid-19 in Narasaraopet town.
