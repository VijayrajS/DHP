HYDERABAD: Devotees gathered at the Chilkur Balaji temple on Thursday and offered prayers with a hope to prevent the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov). Over 2,000 devotees took part in the recitals that lasted for over 45 minutes. 


“We have urged Lord Balaji to stop the spread of Coronavirus and prevent deaths. For this, we are chanting two shlokas — apamarjana stotram and sudarshana ashtakam,” said one of the priests.

A special pooja was also performed in front of the inner sanctum. “These special prayers were held amid the fast-spreading Coronavirus outbreak which has taken a toll on the whole world,” said temple trustee, C S Rangarajan. He made an appeal to the other temples in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to follow the same recital programme for the protection of all from the virus.

The ‘aparjana stotram’ is a prayer, which calls on the various forms of Vishnu to use his Sudarshana Chakra to clean the body and mind from various ailments. After the rituals, divine water was sprinkled on the devotees.
