Pune: Swab collection & screening boost in micro-clusters to check Covid-19 spread
2020-05-09
PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to ramp up collection of swabs of suspected patients, testing and screening of symptomatic people from the 69 micro-clusters to arrest the rise in Covid-19 cases.


While five new swab collection units have already been started in the last two days, the administration plans to introduce more mobile units to save people from travelling to give the samples. The mobile units are being introduced for the first time. 

 


Saurabh Rao, state sugar commissioner who is also overseeing the containment measures in hotspots under the Bhavani Peth and Dhole Patil Road areas, said the focus was on boosting testing and contact tracing. “We are planning a new experiment of introducing mobile units for swab collection. Three units will start running on trial basis soon. Ten units are planned, two each for five most-affected civic wards,” he said.

On Thursday, PMC’s daily swab collection went beyond 1,000. “We are looking to maintain it over 1,000 daily from now on,” a civic official said, while appealing to the citizens to make use of the flu clinics and swab collection units.

A team of dedicated doctors and workers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Jankalyan Samiti (RSSJS) has also joined PMC’s screening drives in the slum and densely populated areas. Over 190 doctors and 520 workers have participated in the initiative.

The members of RSSJS said health check-up of 49,128 citizens from 10,200 households in these zones was completed through the Arogya Raksha Seva Abhiyaan (screening campaign) till Friday. About 811 symptomatic citizens have been referred for further testing and treatment. The masks and homeopathic medicines were also distributed among the people after the health check-up.
