HYDERABAD: While the Telangana government has deferred an increase in property tax, registration charges on properties and power tariff in view of Covid-19 lockdown, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have enhanced toll fee on their respective roads from April 1.


Since there has been a complete lockdown on movement of vehicles and the borders have been closed due to the lockdown, the new rates would come into effect after the lockdown concludes. While the 158 km Nehru Outer Ring Road (ORR) is under the control of HMDA, all national highways are with NHAI.

Officials said the hike was just 4%-5% on various vehicles. While it is just 0.07 paise per km for cars, the enhancement for oversized vehicles is 0.53 paise per km. With this, a person travelling in a car from Nanakramguda (Gachibowli) to Shamshabad has to pay Rs 40 and Rs 110 till Pedda Amberpet. 

With regard to national highways, the increase is between Rs 5 to Rs 25 on Vijayawada and other highways. People going towards Vijayawada on NH 65 have to cough up Rs 80 at Panthangi plaza for light motor vehicles such as cars, jeep and other vehicles. When it comes to commercial vehicles, the fee is Rs 125 and Rs 255 for heavy vehicles. “The toll fee rates of Hyderabad ORR were lesser than the toll fee collected on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Yamuna Expressway in Delhi and national highways. The government can enhance toll fee up to 5% of the existing rates every year i.e from April 1,” a senior official of the HMDA said.

The metropolitan authority had increased the toll fee by 50% in February 2017, to overcome financial crisis and also to cover the loss in revenue accrued due to demonetisation.
