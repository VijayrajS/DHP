Panaji: With the Dabolim airport gearing up to receive Goans from abroad soon, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said not a single passenger will be allowed to exit the airport until the state government obtains his/her Covid-19 test results. 

The nodal officer for NRIs informed the state executive committee that 350 passengers would land in Goa on two flights after around a week. Meanwhile, Sawant said that each person entering the state from abroad would have to undergo a test for coronavirus and that a standard operating procedure (SOP) had been finalised to receive people at the airport as well as at the Mormugao port. 

“We will test everyone, Goan or non-Goan, coming through Dabolim airport. If anyone is found to be positive for Covid-19, he/she will be kept in institutional quarantine,” Sawant said. Those who test negative will have to undergo a mandatory institutional quarantine at their own cost.
