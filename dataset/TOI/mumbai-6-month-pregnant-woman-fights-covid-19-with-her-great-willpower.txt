Mumbai: A 26-year-old Sion resident is among the 2,000 patients in the state who recovered from Covid-19 until Saturday, but what makes this woman’s recovery special is that she is six months pregnant.


“I spent 13 days in the hospital ICU and will have to spend another 28 days in home quarantine, but I am feeling better,” she told TOI.

When she reached S L Raheja Hospital at Mahim on April 18, she could barely breathe. “She couldn’t speak coherently because of low oxygen levels,” said Dr Sanjith Saseedharan, who heads the ICU at S L Raheja Hospital.

As she was pregnant, doctors decided against putting her on ventilator support. “We decided to put her in a proning position which is difficult for a pregnant woman, but it was our best hope...,’’ said Dr Saseedharan.

While most patients on proning are sedated, it wasn’t an option for a pregnant woman. “We used a bit of steroid and lots of blood thinners to ensure she gets better,” said the doctor. It took 13 days before she tested negative twice.”

As the woman will now be in home quarantine, she will not be able to visit her doctor. So, her husband, who is also a doctor, will administer the medicines and injections that she requires.

Doctors at the hospital said the woman has “amazing willpower”
