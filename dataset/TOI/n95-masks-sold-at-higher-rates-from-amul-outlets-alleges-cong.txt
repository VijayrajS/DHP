N95 masks sold at higher rates from Amul outlets, alleges Cong

Ahmedabad: The state Congress on Friday alleged that the state government was charging higher prices for N95 masks being sold from Amul outlets. The Congress said the prices charged for these masks was higher than the price fixed by Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Limited (GMSCL).

Producing a copy of a note of GMSCL dated March 30, where it fixed the maximum price of procurement of a single unit of N95 mask at Rs 49.61, Congress said people were being charged Rs 65 for an N95 mask at Amul parlours.

A statement issued by the party said that at a time when people are bearing the brunt of the lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government is looking to earn profits from the sale of masks.

Meanwhile, although the government announced a couple of days back that triple layered masks and N95 masks will be sold from Amul outlets, several people were left disappointed, as the masks were not made available at a majority of Amul outlets in the city.
