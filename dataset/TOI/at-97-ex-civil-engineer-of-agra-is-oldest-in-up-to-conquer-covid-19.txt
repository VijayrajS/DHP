AGRA: Smiling from ear-to-ear, GC Gupta, 97, was holding his Covid-19 report copy like a trophy. He was free to go home as the report declared him free from the infection on Wednesday evening.


Already suffering from medical complications like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) and urinary infection, Gupta was worried when he contracted the contagious disease. And so were his family members.

A resident of Agra’s Gandhi Nagar colony, the retired civil engineer was admitted to Covid-19 facility at city’s Nayati Hospital, a private establishment, on May 29.

For the next 12 days, he was provided treatment with high-oxygen flow at the isolation facility. On Wednesday evening, the nonagenarian was declared cured of infection. 

District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Following proper care and treatment provided by the doctors, the 97-year-old Covid-19 patient has overcome coronavirus infection. He is a motivation to all of us and a ray of hope to all the Covid-19 patients especially of older age”.

Gupta is the oldest person in UP to be declared Covid-19 free after being infected with it. His closest rival is an Urdu poet who lives in Noida.

A month shy of hitting 94, Anand Mohan Zutshi ‘Gulzar’ Dehlvi was hospitalized in Noida after being found Covid-19 positive. He was declared free of the virus three days ago.

In the last week of May, Dehlvi was admitted to Noida’s Kailash Hospital. He had a fever and cough, symptoms of Covid-19 and comorbidities — coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism and enlarged prostate. His test results came back positive and he was referred to Sharda Hospital on June 1. He got cured and returned home. 

As of now, Mukhtar Ahmed, a resident of Central Delhi’s Nawabganj, holds the country record of being the oldest to trounce the disease. He is 106.
