MYSURU: The Karnataka State Transport Corporation has racked up losses of at least Rs 1.5 crore in March so far due to hundreds of trips cancelled daily over the coronavirus scare in its divisions in Mysuru (rural and urban), Hassan, Chikkamagalur, Mandya, Shivamogga and Chamarajanagar.


Outlining the magnitude of the problem, KSRTC authorities said on Tuesday alone, Mysuru rural cancelled 137 trips, followed by urban at 56; Shivamogga at 43; Hassan at 34; Mandya at 31; and Chikkamagaluru at 22 due to poor occupancy.

The Mysuru rural division, they said, has lost 30% of revenue so far while the urban division has lost 20%.

While passenger volume was dipping due to fears of an outbreak since the beginning of March, the curbs imposed by the state government and local administration has led to a steep decline, KSRTC officials said. Mysuru urban services, for instance, began registering a loss over the past 2-3 days.

The division lost Rs 2.3 lakh on cancellation of premium bus services on March 15 and 16 while the non-premium cancellations cost it nearly Rs 10 lakh between March 14 and 16.

The others have been bearing the brunt for longer. The rural division lost nearly Rs 78 lakh on cancellation of its premium and non-premium services between March 1 and 16.

In the same period, Shivamogga sustained a revenue loss of Rs 16.8 lakh on its premium and non-premium services, followed by Hassan at Rs 14.2 lakh, Chikkamagaluru at Rs 13.9 lakh, Chamarajanagar at Rs 13.4 lakh and Mandya at Rs 2.8 lakh.
