As virus grips Italy, anxiety spreads among Malayalis too
2020-03-22
Kochi: With Covid-19 fast spreading to southern and central Italy from northern parts of the country, more Malayalis are likely to be affected. It is in central Italy, Rome and southern parts of the country that most of Keralites reside.

Many who work part-time as cleaners, salesmen/saleswomen have lost their jobs and are unable to return to Kerala as international flights have been cancelled.

Several students are remaining in rented houses after the shutdown of colleges. Many others who have gone as caretakers to help the elderly are also struggling to cope with anxiety as most of the dead so far belong to old age groups. 

“We can get out of our residences only for going to hospitals or supermarkets,” said Fr Jophy Thottankara, a Keralite priest at a church under Venice diocese.

“Italy values individual freedom, and citizens may have some problems when the government restrict their freedoms. They have even roped in the army to control the youths who violate the lockdown,” Thottankara said. Thottankara, who had served as assistant vicar at a church at Thalayolaparmbu, where recently a holy mass was conducted violating the instructions given by the authorities, called upon believers to abide by the government’s instructions.

“In Kerala, the health department and the government are doing an excellent service. We have to support them” Thottankara said.

He said many of his parishioners, mostly elderly couple, are anxious. “Most of them are widows or widowers and they burst into tears once we start talking. Friends and family members of the dead are sad that they were not even able to see them for one last time,” Thottankara said.

“Even the verandas of hospitals are full of patients. Most of the hospital staff, including Malayali nurses, are staying at hospitals,” said Fr Geo Tharakan, another priest who resides in Rome.
