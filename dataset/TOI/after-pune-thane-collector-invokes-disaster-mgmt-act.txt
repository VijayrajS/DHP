THANE: After Pune, Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar invoked the Disaster Management Act 2005 late on Wednesday to tackle the Covid-19 situation in the district. Narvekar said the Act empowers him to form a dedicated team of officials from revenue and health departments, FDA, police and local self-governing bodies, among others, who will coordinate and take prompt action in case positive cases are detected here. 

Officials said the Act enables them to empanel private hospitals and get them to share their resources and infrastructure to quarantine patients. A senior medical official said they are following up with healthy people who have travelled abroad in recent past. On Thursday, Narvekar said the administration has warned pharmacists against hoarding medical kits and alerted FDA to conduct checks to ensure essential items are not overcharged.

Narvekar warned of stern penal action against those found spreading Covid-19-related rumours on social media that could spark panic. He has called for frequent fumigation and disinfection of bus stands, train stations, malls, hotels, banks and ATMs. 

Fifty-six Thane travellers who recently returned from abroad have been advised home quarantine, as is routine procedure. Narvekar said the residents, including a woman from a gated community in Manpada who had travelled in a cab whose driver tested positive in Pune, have not shown any symptoms.
