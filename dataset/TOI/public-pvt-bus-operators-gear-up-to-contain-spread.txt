Covid-19 preventative measures in Maharashtra: Public and private bus operators gear up to contain
2020-03-06
PUNE: Major public and private transport bodies in the state have directed their employees to keep a tab on passengers and ensure cleanliness in vehicles after a Dubai-returned techie from Bengaluru, who travelled to Hyderabad in a bus, tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection recently.


The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has told all its officials to ensure the strictest level of cleanliness in vehicles amid the Covid-19 scare. “Instructions regarding hygiene have been issued,” state transport commissioner Shekhar Channe said. 

 
 
A source in the MSRTC said a system would soon be started, under which details of passengers would be recorded at all depots and ticketing counters of the state transport utility.

Private luxury bus operators have also been directed to compile list of their passengers. “Passenger details like addresses and contact numbers are being taken before issuance of tickets,” Babasaheb Khadekar, the president of Pune Luxury Bus Association, told TOI.

The Bus and Car Operators’ Confederation of India (BOCI) said an alert was issued to all state federations and member operators to take steps to check the spread of the contagion. “In case a passenger tests positive for Covid-19, the list will come handy to track the other passengers,” BOCI president Prasanna Patwardhan said.
