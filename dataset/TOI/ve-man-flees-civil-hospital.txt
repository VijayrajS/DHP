RAJKOT: A 41-year-old man living in Jangleshwar area of Rajkot tested positive on Tuesday. The source of his infection is still not known because he is not cooperating with the authorities in revealing his travel history. He also escaped from Rajkot Civil Hospital after the doctor on duty suspected him to be positive.


 He was referred by a private physician after his condition deteriorated on Monday evening. When the doctor in civil hospital asked him to complete some formalities, he escaped from there. The doctor alerted health officials because his mobile number was also switched off. Police traced him after one-and-a-half hours in Jangleshwar. Meanwhile, a 29-year-old woman from Bhavnagar also tested positive. She is a family member of a 65-year-old man who had tested positive and is under treatment at Sir T Hospital.
