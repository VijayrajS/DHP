2020-06-06
Vijayawada: While the number of Covid-19 cases continues to show a rapid increase in the state, officials claim that it is the increased testing capacity that has led to the spike in numbers. The higher case numbers, they said, can also help in early detection and prevent the spread of the virus.

Andhra Pradesh had close to 1,460 Covid-19 cases when the state crossed the one lakh milestone in number of tests conducted. At two lakh tests, the tally rose to 2,130 positive cases. The pattern of transmission has been similar for the three lakh tests mark (2,797 cases) and the four lakh mark (3,791 cases). The state crossed the 4,000-case mark on June 4. Foreign returnees, people from other states and cases linked to the Koyambedu market account for nearly 1,100 cases in AP.

The positivity rate stood at 1.42% for the first one lakh tests, while it decreased to 1.06% by the time the state crossed the two lakh mark. It further fell to 0.92% at the three lakh mark and rose marginally to 0.98% at four lakh tests. The state continues to top the chart in terms of the number of people screened per million population and on June 2, conducted 12,613 tests, the highest number of tests on a single day.

The first Covid-19 viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) was set up at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS), Tirupati on February 15. Till April 14, the state had conducted only 9,794 tests. By May 1, however, the state had conducted one lakh tests. Apart from RT-PCR testing, the state also used 350 Truenat machines to speed up the testing process. 

While it took over two months for the first one lakh tests, the next one lakh were conducted in 12 days, by May 13. Time taken to conduct the subsequent one lakh tests further decreased to 11 days and the four lakh mark was reached in another 10 days.

At a recent review meeting, special chief secretary, medical, health and family welfare department, KS Jawahar Reddy asked officials to augment testing and treatment facilities, in view of expertsâ€™ predictions of cases peaking in June. 

The special chief secretary also directed the officials to focus more on persons aged above 65 and suffering from chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiac issues, to reduce the number of Covid-19-related deaths.
