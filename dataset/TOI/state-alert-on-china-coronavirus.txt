Rajasthan alert on China coronavirus
2020-01-23
JAIPUR: An alert has been sounded across the state on novel coronavirus, a virus that has infected over 400 people and caused nine deaths in China. Since many people travel from Jaipur to China for business purposes, the health department has alerted its staff.


The state is vulnerable to novel coronavirus as it is a zoonotic disease and the state had reported 16 deaths due to such zoonotic diseases in 2019. 

 
 
In all, 3,111 people had also tested positive for three zoonotic diseases — Scrub Typhus, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) and Brucellosis last year.

Since, novel coronavirus is also a zoonotic disease, the health department is taking help of the agriculture department to ward off any chances of novel coronavirus entering the state. 

“We have alerted all chief medical health officers in the state on coronavirus. We have sent them guidelines and information about the disease,” said Dr KK Sharma, director (health), health department. 

According to the health department, the clinical signs and symptoms of the virus are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty in breathing. 

Moreover, the mode of transmission is unclear as of now. The health department officials said so far there is little evidence of significant human-to-human transmission.

Besides, World Health Organisation has issued an advice for international travellers stating that while the cause of the pneumonia seems to be a novel coronavirus, transmission potential and modes of transmission remain unclear. 

Therefore, it would be prudent to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections while travelling in or from affected areas (currently Wuhan City).

WHO pointed out that travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
