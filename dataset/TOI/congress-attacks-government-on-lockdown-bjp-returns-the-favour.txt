Congress attacks government on lockdown, BJP returns the favour
2020-05-21
NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday dismissed Congress claims of countrywide lockdown being implemented in an unplanned manner, saying that under PM Modi, India has demonstrated unprecedented leadership to the world in battling the Covid-19 crisis.


“It was never a claim of the government that there will be no corona cases as a result of the lockdown. An individual’s opinions do not reflect the government’s views,” said BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao. “The Congress party could have imagined a corona-free India only if Dr Rahul Gandhi would have invented a vaccine before the lockdown was imposed,” he said.

The remarks came soon after Congress said implementation of the nationwide lockdown was unplanned and alleged that the government does not have any exit strategy.

Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said this government is synonymous with “inefficiency, incompetence and insensitivity” and its taskforce has been indulging in “data jugglery” to claim that “there will be zero cases by May 16”.

Rao, however, explained that the lockdown had to be imposed suddenly and without weeks of notice as the spread of the virus had to be contained by asking people to stay where they were. He said under Congress rule, India had always been seen as a country worst prepared to handle any health emergency.

“Under PM Modi, India has demonstrated unprecedented leadership to the world in battling the Covid-19 challenge with its hugely successful lockdown,” Rao said.

He said Congress is “deeply jealous and envious” of the soaring image of the Prime Minister both at home and abroad, as reflected in global and national surveys.
