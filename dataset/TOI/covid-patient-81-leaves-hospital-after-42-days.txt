2020-05-17
KANNUR: An 81-year-old Covid-19 patient, undergoing treatment for the last 42 days at Government Medical College Kannur, Pariyaram, has been discharged after his two consecutive tests were negative.

On April 5, he tested positive and became the first primary contact in the district to be infected. The octogenarian, who apparently contracted the disease from his grandson coming from Dubai, had serious health problems when he tested positive.

Ten people of the family, including immediate relatives, had contracted the disease but they were all discharged from hospital earlier.

The octogenarian had to be given oxygen regularly even before hospitalization as he suffered from respiratory problems. Adding to the woes, he suffered a heart attack but prompt treatment saved his life, said hospital authorities

After his condition improved, swabs were tested 16 times. On Friday, two of his samples tested negative from the same PCR laboratory, following which he was discharged on Saturday afternoon.

“It is a big achievement that the patient was discharged after 42 days of treatment,” said medical college principal N Roy. Besides medical college staffers, MLA T V Rajesh was among those present to see off the senior citizen.

With this, all those admitted here in first phase have been discharged. Now there is a patient from Kasaragod, who was admitted recently as he tested positive on return from Maharashtra after borders were opened.
