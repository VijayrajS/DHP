Lockdown reins in child marriages in Rajasthan
2020-04-26
KOTA: The Covid-19 pandemic has come as a blessing in disguise in checking child marriages, which were solemnised despite strict administrative vigilance in large numbers in Kota, Bundi, Jhalawar and Baran districts of Hadauti on Akshaya Tritiya, also called Akha Teej that falls this year on April 26.


Akha Teej is believed to be an auspicious occasion to solemnise marriages, particularly child marriages in the rural belt of Hadauti in Rajasthan, mainly in Gurjar, Meena, Bairwa, Mali and other SC/ST communities. However, fortunately, no report of child marriages on this occasion has surfaced so far from any of the four districts of the division.

The district administration of the four districts of the region used to be extra cautious during Akshaya Tritiya, but this year has come as a relief. However, Kota district collector Om Kasera on Thursday directed district officials to ensure that no child marriage takes place in the district on Akshaya Tritiya on April 26 and to form the vigilance teams to monitor the rural areas. “The reports of child marriages on Akshaya Tritiya this year are nil (zero) so far, due to strict enforcement of lockdown,” said deputy director, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Bundi, Bhairu Prakesh Nagar.

The anganwadi and ASHAs are already in the field to survey for Covid-19 and they have not reported any suspected child marriage in the area on Akshaya Tritiya so far, he further said, adding unlike previous years, no control room for child marriage, ahead of Akshaya Tritiya, has been set up this year. However, one-stop centre in the district is functional to receive and sort out women-related grievances including that of child marriages.
