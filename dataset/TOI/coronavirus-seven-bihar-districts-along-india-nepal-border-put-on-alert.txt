PATNA: The state health department on Saturday put seven districts sharing borders with Nepal, especially East Champaran and Araria, on alert after a student was tested positive for coronavirus in the neighbouring country. The guideline issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare along with a pro forma was also shared with all the districts late on Friday evening.

“A student from Nepal, who had been to Wuhan, was tested positive for the virus. As a result, the seven districts sharing borders with Nepal have been alerted,” state health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said. The other five districts are Sitamarhi, Kishanganj, Supaul, Madhubani and West Champaran.

According to reports, Nepal confirmed the first case of deadly coronavirus on Friday after a student studying in Wuhan was tested positive for it. He had returned to Kathmandu on January 5 and developed severe acute respiratory illness. His blood samples and throat swabs, which were sent to World Health Organisation laboratory in Hong Kong, were tested positive for coronavirus.

The state health department has also asked airports to remain alert as many tourists come to Bihar from China as well.

The health department has also sent reporting formats to health institutes in all the districts. A protocol has been introduced for sending daily health status of passengers under observation. As per the format, state surveillance unit will collect the line list or email IDs of passengers coming from coronavirus-hit countries from airports or the ministry of external affairs. They will then share the list with district surveillance units at least for the next 28 days.

Passengers with coronavirus symptoms have been advised to restrict their movement and contact 24-hour helpline number 011-23978046.
