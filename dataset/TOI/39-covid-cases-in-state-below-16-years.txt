2020-04-17
VIJAYAWADA: As many as 39 children below 16 years have tested positive for Covid-19 in Andhra Pradesh, indicating that no age group is immune from the pandemic. In the 0-10 years age group, 19 kids figure in the Covid-19 positive list of 534 as of Thursday morning. Children as little as three years old have also contracted the novel coronavirus. The 11-20 years age bracket accounts for 44 cases or nearly 8.2% of all Covid-19 positive cases registered thus far in the state.


Nearly 44% cases affected by Covid-19 in AP belong to the 21-40 years age group, as per data of the state government for 534 Covid-19 cases. This correlates with the national trends of nearly 40% Covid-19 incidence in the 21-40 years age group. The next most-affected group is 41-60 years with about 34% cases in the state.

Officials said that contrary to popular belief that the elderly are more susceptible to Covid-19, only about 10% patients are above 60 years. There are four patients aged 80 years, the oldest among all. While 40 patients are in the 61-70 years age group, 14 patients belong to the 71-80 years bracket. When it comes to gender, men make up for nearly 72% cases. Of the 534 cases registered till Thursday morning, only 149 women tested positive. Health officials said children showed very mild symptoms and responded well to the treatment.

The majority of the Covid-19 patients, who were cured and discharged from hospitals so far in Andhra Pradesh, belong to the 21-40 years age group. However, the recent recovery of a 70-year-old patient in Visakhapatnam and two 65-year-old patients – one from Vijayawada and one from Visakhapatnam – come as a glimmer of hope in the fight against the pandemic, officials said.

Several discharged patients also had comorbidities.

On the other hand, a majority of the 14 Covid-related fatalities were in patients aged 50 years or above. Several of these deaths occurred in patients with pre-existing health conditions.

According to the state authorities, these comorbidities might have made them susceptible to the Covid-related complications. But the officials are yet to establish the origin of the disease in some of the death cases.

Special chief secretary, medical, health and family welfare, KS Jawahar Reddy, said the combined Covid-19 testing capacity of the state has reached to 3,000 samples a day from just 90 samples on February 15.

“We want to take it to 17,000 in the next one week. Andhra Pradesh has tested 331 people per million against the country’s average of 198 tests and stands among the few states screening higher number of people,” said Jawahar Reddy.
