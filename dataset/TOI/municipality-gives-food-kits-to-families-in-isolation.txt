2020-03-23
KOCHI: To address the shortage of provisions in the houses of people in home quarantine, Kalamassery municipality reaches out to them with food kits.

Around 82 people, who had travelled from abroad and other parts of India, have been undergoing home quarantine within the limits of the local body.

“When there is nobody to buy provisions for a family under home quarantine, the municipality steps in to purchase and transport the essentials to respective houses. We buy as per the requirement of each family. One food kit is only for 14 days. If the provisions run out before 14 days, they can raise it with us. the local body spends around Rs 1,000 for a food kit. Initially, we got some food kits from the district administration. But that has run out and we decided to buy the kits ourselves,” said Bindhu Manoharan, chairperson of the health standing committee of the Kalamassery municipality.

A sanitizer, which has become a prized possession, is also part of the kit. “If a person is in home quarantine and his/her family is not in a position to come out of home, they can contact the health inspector of the respective areas. The official will inform the municipality health officer, who in turn buys the kit from a shop, identified earlier,” said a health official.
