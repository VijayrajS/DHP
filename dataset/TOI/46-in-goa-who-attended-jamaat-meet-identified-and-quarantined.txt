PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday that his government has identified 46 people in the state who attended the markaz of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi last month. All of them have have been quarantined, he said.


Sawant said that none of the 46 are Goans, and that all of them will be tested in the next two days. “Their test results will decide if Goa is in safe zone or in danger zone,” he said.

Sawant said that nine of the 46 stayed in Ponda, 16 in Fatorda, 13 in Vasco, and others in Old Goa and Bicholim. He also said that all of them entered Goa before March 15. The CM also said that nine of those identified stayed at a mosque in Goa for the past 10-12 days, but the government wasn’t informed.

Thamin Ansari from the organisation’s headquarters in Delhi told TOI that between March 7 and March 9, around 25 people from Goa visited Nizamuddin to attend its religious congregation.

Meanwhile, the CM appealed to Muslims to inform police if anyone who belongs to the Tablighi Jamaat or attended its meeting has not been quarantined or is staying in a mosque. 

“We are searching to see if there are more members of the Tablighi Jamaat, including maulanas, in Goa,” he said. “Our Muslim brothers have to cooperate with police to identify them. This issue is not related to any religion.” 

Sawant also emphasised on the need for an inquiry to know the reason behind their visit to the state.

He also issued a general appeal to the people to inform police or helpline if they know of anyone who has recently come from outside the state.
