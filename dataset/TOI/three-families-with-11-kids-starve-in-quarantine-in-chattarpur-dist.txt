Bhopal: Quarantined for over a week, three families with eleven children scarred by lockdown are starving for the last three days in Lavkush Nagar of Chattarpur district.Hunger is excruciating these families from May 30, the day they had returned to their homes and were sent for 15 days quarantine.All of them were working at a brick kiln in Dhaulopur, they said they were helped by the Rajasthan government for travelling up to Charkhari village of Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh. From there, they made gruelling 50km journey on foot to reach Lavkush Nagar .Anwar, father of an 8 -year-old Ayan said, “ We had some ration but it lasted for three days only. Now, there is no one to look after us.”He said, “ No villager can help us as their entry is not allowed. We cannot even move out to work and earn”.Anwar said that when they had reached Charkhari, officials in Uttar Pradesh provided ration to many families who travelled along with them. But they were not given any ration as they didn’t belong to Uttar Pradesh.Hari Prajapti who has three children said, “ We lost our jobs after the lockdown and were forced to live in penury. We don’t have ration cards and can’t have provisions to sustain during the confinement”.“We have been sleeping empty stomachs for the past three days,” he added, sitting at his doorstep.Santosh Chouhan with six children also had the similar story to narrate.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Avinash Rawat, however, said, “We are looking after all the people who are quarantined. We have also been providing ration to those who are living a hand-to-mouth existence.”There are over 200 migrants quarantined in Lavkush Nagar.
