2020-06-10
Gandhinagar: Even as there is considerable speculation whether Covid-19 positive MLAs will be allowed to cast their vote or not in the upcoming Rajya Sabha election, the state chief electoral officer said there are no directions yet from the Election Commission of India on the matter.Three BJP MLAs have tested Covid positive and others could be infected by coronavirus if they are allowed to cast their vote in the June 19 RS election. The office of the state chief electoral officer is expecting a communication from the ECI, as this is a nationwide phenomenon and political parties are left worried about their prospects in the elections if infected MLAs cannot vote.S Murali Krishna, chief electoral officer, Gujarat, said, “So far, no decision has been made about the arrangements to be made for the Covid-affected MLAs to vote in the Rajya Sabha election. The ECI is expected to issue categorical directions on the voting by corona-affected or symptomatic MLAs.”He added that the Representation of Peoples’ Act allows only physical assistance during voting if the voter requests in advance. “However he/she has to come at the voting booth. There is no provision in the act of allowing proxy voting. Only postal ballot voting is allowed but that has to be requested before the nomination,” Murali Krishna said.He added that his office will however, arrange for health check-up at the voting area and those who have Covid-like symptoms will be allowed to vote at special arrangements only if there are specific directions from the ECI.
