2020-05-02
AHMEDABAD: As on May 1, Gujarat with 4,721 total cases and 3,749 active cases is on second place in India after Maharashtra. Even in deaths related to Covid-19, the state has recorded 236 casualties of positive patients which is also second only to Maharashtra in India.

As third phase of national lockdown is announced on Friday, how has the state fared during previous two phases? Analysis of the figures till May 1 reveal that compared to lockdown 1.0, the rate of new cases and deaths has decreased in Gujarat.

Based on state health & family welfare statistics, Gujarat had 33 positive cases and 1 death reported till March 24. The first lockdown was observed from March 25 to April 14. During this period, the state added 617 cases and 27 deaths. Compared to the starting point, the figures were 18.7 and 27 times higher.

Likewise, the second phase of lockdown started from April 15 and will end on May 3. Data till evening of May 1 reveal that the state added 4,071 cases and 208 deaths in 15 days. Compared to the figures till end of lockdown 1.0, the multiplication factors came down to 6.3 and 7.4 respectively.

Among the three major cities of Gujarat, Vadodara recorded the most difference. It had 6 cases pre-lockdown in which 107 cases were added during lockdown 1 and 176 during lockdown 2.0 (till March 30), thus bringing the multiplication factor down from 17.8 to 1.5. Compared to that, Surat has reported a rising trend – compared to a sixfold rise in cases in lockdown 1.0, in lockdown 2.0 the Diamond City has reported 13.6 times more cases. However, compared to other states and national average, Gujarat lags behind in reducing cases. While cases went down from 19 times to 2 times from lockdown 1.0 to 2.0 in India, Delhi reduced it from 51 to 1.3.

A city-based epidemiologist said the impact of lockdown in terms of effectiveness for arresting growth of Covid-19 is of interest. “We still need more data to validate whether the lockdown is the only factor – several states have adopted aggressive testing, whereas in some states, the measures were stringent,” said the official.
