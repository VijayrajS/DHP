BHOPAL: A 60-year-old Ayush doctor, with a predisposed high-risk medical condition, was assigned to carry out door-to-door health checks and distribute medicines in Covid-19-19 hotspots and eventually contracted coronavirus.

On April 9, he assisted a Gandhi Medical College (GMC) post-graduate student working in Sultania hospital after she tested positive for Covid-19-19. Thirteen days later, the Ayush medical officer, Dr Rizwan Saleem Ansari, also tested positive for Covid-19-19. He lives in the same apartment behind Sultania hospital as the Covid-19-19 patient. 

Four people tested positive in the same apartment, including a Sultania hospital nurse. Both the government workers in emergency service were asked to report for work by their respective departments, despite coming in close contact with a Covid-19-19 patient. Both are undergoing treatment in a private medical college. 

“Since I was aware of coming in close contact with Covid-19 patient, I got my sample tested. I got the test conducted on April 16. On April 22, I was on duty when I got a call confirming I am Covid-19-19 positive,” said Dr Ansari.

However, between April 9 to 22, when he tested positive, Dr Ansari was told to report for work. His sample was taken on April 16, seven days after coming in contact with the Covid-19 patient. 

In order to get more medical staff and doctors, the Madhya Pradesh health department has offered a package of Rs 1.25 lakh per month for MD doctors, PG Diploma Rs 1.10 lakh per month, MBBS Rs 60,000, AYUSH Rs 25,000, staff nurse Rs 20,000 and ANM Rs 12,000 per month.

“We were issued one N95 masks when we went into the field. Since then, more supplies were hard to come by. We wore single-layer masks, which were available at a premium. Better protection should be provided to Ayush doctors too,” said Dr Ansari, who wants to return to work when he is declared fit. 

Dr Ansari’s condition is stable. He took Unani medicine to counter the first symptoms of Covid-19-19. Joshanda is an ancient multi-ingredient alternative remedy for the treatment of acute upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold, sore throat, sneezing, rhinitis and flu-associated fever, he said. 

“We go door to door and provide homeopathic medication. It is administrated to boost immunity and recommended by AYUSH department,” he said.
