AHMEDABAD: Senior officials of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Friday released their action plan to control the spread of COVID-19. City municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra told the media that no notification related to the closure of schools or the cancellation of Holi celebrations had been issued. 


“So far, there is no positive case in the city,” he said. “We are taking all precautions and any notification will create unnecessary panic. We are relying on advisories issued by the government on avoiding large gatherings. We appeal to citizens to exercise caution while celebrating the festival.”

AMC officials said that till Friday, 13 persons from within AMC limits had been been quarantined at Civil Hospital and SVP Hospital but all tested negative for COVID-19. “BRTS and AMTS bus stands will soon have hand sanitizers. If citizens are found spitting at the public places, they can be fined up to Rs 10,000. Infrared thermometers have been procured for CHCs and PHCs for quicker identification of infections,” said a senior AMC official.

Officials added a total of 51 isolation beds are ready at the three AMC-run hospitals along with 14 ventilators. If needed, this can be expanded to 250 beds. “Keeping hands clean is an effective way to thwart the virus,” said Nehra.
