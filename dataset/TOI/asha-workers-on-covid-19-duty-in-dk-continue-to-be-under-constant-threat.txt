ASHA workers on Covid-19 duty in DK continue to be under constant threat
2020-04-15
Mangaluru: Two weeks ago, 48-year-old ASHA worker Tulasi was manhandled and threatened while inquiring about the health status of home-quarantined people in Amtady. She is not alone; several Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) in Dakshina Kannada continue to be under constant threat while carrying out duties in the fight to contain Covid-19. So far, the district has registered three such cases.

These unsung heroes, who get a paltry pay, put their health at risk while visiting remote villages for surveillance work. Yet, they are humiliated abused, assaulted and threatened. An official said: “ASHA workers visit each household and conduct survey in cities, towns and remote villages. They collect information about people suffering from fever, cold, headache, sore throat or any other symptoms related to coronavirus. They also upload the collected information online through a mobile application and inform officials about individuals needing urgent medical attention.” 

Based on their survey, higher officials take further decisions. “However, it is sad that people have not recognised their sacrifice,” the official added.

While a few such incidents are reported, several attacks go unreported, said a source. An ASHA worker said her family is dissuading her from visiting households for field surveillance over fears of infection. “Worried about infection, my family members have been asking me to stop going to field visits, but I have convinced them to allow me to work. Our help is crucial to government to contain the spread of Covid-19,” she said.
