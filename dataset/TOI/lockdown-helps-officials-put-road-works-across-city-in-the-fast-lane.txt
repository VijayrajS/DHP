2020-05-10
HYDERABAD: The lockdown has been a blessing in disguise for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), which is expediting the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) works. Absence of heavy traffic in the past two months is facilitating the speedy completion of works.


According to GHMC officials, the steel bridge at Panjagutta will be inaugurated on June 2. The flyover work at Rd No.45, Jubilee Hills and the cable stayed bridge at Durgam Cheruvu could see completion by July.

The officials are expecting level-I flyover at the Bio-Diversity Junction to be put to use by the end of this month. In the eastern part of the city, Kamineni flyover will be ready by June and the underpass near LB Nagar will be constructed by August, while the Bairamalguda flyover can be used by June.

While works in the Charminar zone are under rapid progress, construction of Bahadurpura flyover and Owaisi Hospital flyover is also underway at a brisk pace. “The works pertaining to Panjagutta steel bridge will be completed within a month, and the government is planning to inaugurate it on Telangana Formation Day (June 2),” said a GHMC official. The government had sanctioned the construction of steel bridge and the road widening (two way) at Panjagutta graveyard at an estimated cost of Rs 23 crore under the SRDP. 

Hyderabad mayor, Bonthu Rammohan, and principal secretary of municipal administration and urban development (MAUD), Arvind Kumar, had inspected the steel bridge on Friday. Another SRDP project to extend the Tolichowki to Gachibowli main road up to Malkam Chervu is also under progress.
