PUNE: Over 16,000 Puneites have responded to a survey undertaken by Pune police on their implementation of the lockdown norms. The police uploaded the survey form on May 19. Police said it was aimed at understanding the issues faced by people and to find new ways to check the spread of Covid-19.

The respondents were asked reasons for stepping out of their houses, their fears about the pandemic and challenges faced during lockdown, as well as suggestions to contain the Covid-19 spread. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam said the report would be released on Friday. 

Many residents of Pimpri Chinchwad too took the survey and urged the Pimpri Chinchwad police to undertake a similar survey.
