MUMBAI: After visiting Dharavi and meeting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to suggest augmented efforts to combat the Covid-19 threat in Mumbai, the central inter-ministerial team led by additional secretary Manoj Joshi will now visit Thane.


A senior official said the central team found blatant violations of lockdown measures in Mumbai. 

“Implementation of the lockdown measures are indeed very poor and as a result, despite best efforts, we have not been able to halt new cases of Covid-19,’’ he said.

The central team will make on-the-spot assessment of the situation in the coronavirus hotposts of Mumbai, Thane and Pune and issue necessary directions to the state administration for redressal and submit its report to the ministry of home affairs. 

The visiting central team has been focusing on a range of issues, including compliance and implementation of lockdown measures as per guidelines prescribed by the ministry, supply of essential commodities, preparedness of health infrastructure, hospital facilities, availability of testing kits, PPEs, masks, safety equipment and the condition in relief and shelter camps.
