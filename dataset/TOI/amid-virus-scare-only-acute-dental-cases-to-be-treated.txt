Amid virus scare, only acute dental cases to be treated
2020-03-19
Panaji: Dentists in the state have begun treating only emergency cases and postponing any non-essential dental procedures amid coronavirus concerns for the next two weeks.

The steps were taken after advisories were issued by the Indian Dental Association and Dental Council of India.

Goa Dental College is now attending to only a fraction of the 100-odd patients it otherwise sees. The decision to attend to only emergency cases was taken at a meeting of all heads of departments of the dental college on Monday.

“We have told patients that only emergency cases will be treated till March 31. These include cases of swelling, abscesses, fractures, severe toothaches, root canals and other trauma,” a senior consultant at the hospital said. 

As a result, staff strength has also been reduced. Besides clinics, patients - especially senior citizens and children - sitting in waiting rooms could also be at a risk of being infected. Extra precautions are being taken to sanitise tabletops, chairs and all other surfaces. 

Posters have been put up around the college informing patients of the risks the virus poses. 

The dental college, however, continues to remain open till 4.30pm.

Private dental clinics have also begun following suit.

“We have deferred all non-emergency procedures and are attending to those with acute problems only. The precautions are more for the safety of our doctors as we face a high risk of getting infected,” a dentist from Panaji said. 

The Indian Dental Association has strongly recommended that all dentists in the country voluntarily suspend non-essential and non-urgent dental care up to March 31. It has stated that it “does not make this request lightly. It is being done as an abundance of caution during this serious outbreak and historic public health emergency”.
