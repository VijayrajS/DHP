NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has informed protesters at Shaheen Bagh that not more than four people would be allowed to sit in for the protest till March 31.


According to the cops, anyone apart from the four protesters found assembling at the Shaheen Bagh protest site would be arrested. Police has also asked the protesters to sit at a distance of three metres from each other.

Protesters said they would be taking turns through the day to man the protest site from Monday. They would also not be allowed to use microphones, as it is prohibited under Section 144 of the CrPC, currently imposed in the city.

“We have asked protesters to ensure that anyone who has recently been put on quarantine is not allowed to enter the protest site. Anyone doing so would be immediately booked,” said a senior police officer.

On Monday, only four women were allowed to enter the protest site, while others left their slippers and a name tag along with it to mark their presence.

On Saturday night, hours before the lockdown was enforced, two groups of protesters had engaged in a minor scuffle arising from differences over continuing the protest or calling it off.
