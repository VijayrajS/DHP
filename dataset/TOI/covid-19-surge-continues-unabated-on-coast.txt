Covid-19 surge continues unabated on Coast
2020-06-07
Mangaluru/Udupi: The coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada combined accounted for 145 out of 378 positive cases that Karnataka recorded on Saturday, with Udupi accounting for 121 of those cases. However, there was some good news, as 104 patients were discharged from hospital after treatment, including 101 in Udupi and the rest in Dakshina Kannada. People who returned from Maharashtra contributed to the majority of the cases.

Stressing on the discharge of 101 patients in hale-and-hearty condition, G Jagadeesha, deputy commissioner, Udupi, said 120 out of 121 positive cases in Udupi were its residents, and the other case–a person from Dakshina Kannada—has been referred to authorities there for treatment. “None of the patients in the district are critical or in need of ICUs, high flow oxygen or in need of ventilator,” he said, adding that more patients are lined up for discharge in the next two days.

The day’s development saw Udupi still on top of the Covid-19 chart with 654 active cases. Jagadeesha said that since the Covid-19 testing laboratory adopted the pool testing method, the lab is still saddled with 422 swab samples, and the results of these will be known on Sunday. “We should see the last spurt of positive cases as far as the district is concerned, once these results come out,” he said. A total 233 patients have been discharged in the district thus far.

Dr Prashanth Bhat, Covid-19 nodal officer, earlier at a DISHA meeting that Shobha Karandlaje, Udupi-Chikkamangaluru MP chaired, said an average 100 patients will be discharged daily after treatment in the next 72 hours. In all, 98% of the 889 positive cases were asymptomatic. The district collected 12,258 samples and reports of 10,992 samples were negative. There has been no recorded case of community transmission in the district thus far, Dr Bhat said.

On the other hand, Dakshina Kannada district recorded 24 positive cases. These included 11 cases from those who had returned from Maharashtra, seven from United Arab Emirates, and one from Turkey. Authorities are tracing the source of infection of five patients, said Gayathri Nayak, in-charge of the Dakshina Kannada district bulletin. The district that has 167 recorded positive cases, saw 5 deaths due to Covid-19, one non-Covid-19 death and one death due to liver cirrhosis.
