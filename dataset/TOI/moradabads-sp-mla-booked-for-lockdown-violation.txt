Moradabad’s SP MLA booked for ‘lockdown violation’
2020-05-24
BAREILLY: Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA from Moradabad Ikram Qureshi was booked for “assembling a large crowd at his residence for ration distribution and violating social distancing norms amid Covid-19 lockdown in a hotspot”. Police have lodged an FIR against him and his son Ubaid on Saturday.

The SP MLA, however, said that every year on the last Friday of Ramzan he distributes food among the poor and he was only following the tradition.

Additional superintendent of police (city) Amit Anand said that an FIR under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC and relevant sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act was lodged against the MLA and his son.

“Further action will be taken,” the police officer said, adding that while distributing ration, they were not using face masks.

The FIR had been lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by a sub-inspector in which he stated that he was, along with his team, on lockdown duty when around 2:30 pm he found that scores of people, including women, had come out on to the streets from Asalatpur and Eidgah localities.

“The people said that they were going to the MLA’s house where food was being provided. I immediately informed the police station for additional force to control the crowd. The MLA didn’t respond whether he had taken permission from the district administration,” a copy of the complaint stated.

When asked, despite being a lawmaker, why he wasn’t aware of the lockdown norms, the MLA said, “What can I do if people assemble in such large numbers? I have been feeding the poor every Ramzan.”
