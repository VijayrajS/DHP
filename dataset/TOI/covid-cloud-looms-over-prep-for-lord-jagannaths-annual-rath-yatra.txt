Covid cloud looms over prep for Lord Jagannath’s annual rath yatra
2020-06-11
Lucknow: For the first time in its 100-year history, the annual Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra of Chowk will be held without troupes, tableau trucks and massive crowd of devotees due to novel coronavirus pandemic.

Organised at Badi Kali Ji Mandir by Shri Shri Jagannath Rath Yatra and Navratra Mela Samiti, the Rath Yatra was scheduled on June 23.

As per tradition, devotees pull the ‘rath’ (chariots) of three deities—Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and Devi Subhadra.

Temple authorities have decided on a mini version of the yatra with deities in three ‘palkis’ on a vehicle accompanied by 10 people, including committee members and priests, while maintaining physical distance. The temple will be closed for public. The plan yatra will be livestreamed on social media.

Organizing committee member Anurag Dixit said: “We have requested the administration to allow a mini version of the yatra. Those participating will perform the ritual of ‘nauka vihar’ in Gomti. We will request devotees to stay at home and offer prayers from the terrace or watch live on Facebook.”

Similar decisions have also been taken by other prominent puja committees.

Shri Radha Madhav Sewa Sansthan of Madhav Mandir in Daliganj, which will enter its 59th year of Jagannath Yatra, will perform only a set of rituals in the temple.

“Instead of five days, a three-day event will be organised. On first two days, a blood donation camp will be set up, food packets and masks will be distributed.On June 23, a puja will be organised inside the temple. Devotees will offer prayers from outside the main entrance,” said spokesperson Anurag Sahu.

The 96-year-old Shri Mahant Shatrughan Das Rath Yatra Samiti of Aminabad is also considering to skip the yatra. Surya Prakash Pathak, a member, said the temple will remain closed.
