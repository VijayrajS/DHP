2020-05-04
Ahmedabad: India has been successfully fighting the Covid-19 pandemic with the frontline warriors being medical personnel, police, government staff, and volunteers. In a nationwide drive to boost the morale of Covid-19 frontline warriors, recognize their contribution and express solidarity with them, the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force organized demonstrations across the state and country.

 In Gujarat, on Sunday, Indian Air Force MI-17 V5 helicopters showered flower petals over Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, and GMERS Hospital, Gandhinagar in the morning hours. In the background, there was a scintillating musical performance by South Western Air Command (SWAC) band. At about 11am, a flypast by a formation of three Su-30 fighter aircraft was conducted over the Gujarat legislative assembly building.

People in the city watched from the terraces of their homes and flats as the Su-30 warrior jets flew over the Sabarmati riverfront. Even the hospital staff came out to see the MI-17 V5 helicopters showering flowers. However, at some places people forgot to maintain social distancing while watching the flower showers.
