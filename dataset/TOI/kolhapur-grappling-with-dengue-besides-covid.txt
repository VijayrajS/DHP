Kolhapur grappling with dengue besides Covid
2020-06-02
Kolhapur: The civic administration, while trying to prevent the spread of Covid-19, is also grappling with another problem — the rise in dengue cases in the city. 

Over the past few days, dengue suspects with high fever have been reported from Rajarampuri, Daulatnagar, Rajendranagar, Sathmari and Tatakadil Talim Mandal areas in Kolhapur city. Officials of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) said there have been atleast four confirmed dengue cases from these areas.

The untimely showers a couple of weeks ago led to waterlogging in many areas, providing a conducive environment for dengue-spreading mosquitoes to breed. Most dengue cases are usually reported in May and June every year. 

The KMC’s health department has appealed to the citizens to not get confused between the symptoms of dengue and Covid-19. 

KMC’s chief health officer Dilip Patil said, “Both diseases have distinct symptoms. While in dengue, high fever is accompanied by headache, bodyache and joint pain, the symptoms of Covid-19 are dry cough and rise in body temperature.”

“We have already started looking for dengue suspects. Private hospitals have been asked to notify the details of the patients who get admitted for dengue treatment. We are collecting blood samples of the suspects and getting them tested in the Sentinel laboratory at Chhatrapati Pramila Raje hospital,” said Patil.

The civic administration has also appealed to citizens to donate blood as the blood banks are facing shortages. Plasma with platelets is injected into dengue patients as their platelet-count plummets drastically. Without blood donation, adequate amount of plasma cannot be prepared. While the platelet count in a healthy individual is around 1.5 lakh to 4.5 lakh/microlitre of blood, the count drops to 20,000/microlitre of blood in dengue patients. In a worst case scenario, the situation may turn fatal if plasma is not injected in time.
