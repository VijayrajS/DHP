2020-06-05
HYDERABAD: Taking advantage of a Covid-19 patient and his family being away for treatment at Gandhi Hospital, burglars struck at their independent house in Alwal during the lockdown and decamped with gold jewellery, laptops and other valuables. Though the burglary is suspected to have taken place between May 12 and 26, it only came to light on Thursday. 


The patient and his family members got admitted to hospital on May 12. His wife and other family members were discharged on May 26. When they returned home, they found a breach in their sliding door, which gives access to their independent house. “When my family went inside, they found the almirah open and valuables inside their house missing,’’ the person, who has since recovered, said in his complaint. 

According to him, 10 tolas of gold, Rs 30,000 cash, two laptops, three tabs and 18 watches were stolen. The family members returned to their residence on May 26 after undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital and were shocked to find the house burgled. 

A case was registered on the same day and investigation is still under way.
