LUCKNOW: UP government has achieved a record of sorts by distributing 29.66 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains in the two months of lockdown. According to a state government spokesperson, about 3.55 crore people were provided ration twice every month during the lockdown.

The fifth phase of distribution cycle, which began on Monday, saw distribution of more than 81,000 metric tonnes of foodgrains on the first day itself. This included 78,325 metric tonnes of rice and over 3,000 metric tonnes of gram (chana). The distribution was made to over 31.12 lakh ration card holders. Besides, nearly 35,500 metric tonnes of foodgrains was distributed free. At the same, the food and civil supply department distributed 16.6 metric tonnes of foodgrains to 1212 migrant labourers. They were given wheat along with rice and gram.

The foodgrains distribution cycle started in April when around 7.5 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains was distributed. The distribution cycle received a push following initiation of PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana which covered nearly 3.5 crore people.

According to the spokesperson, the state government mainly covered daily wagers and street vendors who were hit the most because of the lockdown. 

“The CM has directed to cover not only the ration card holders but also those who did not have ration cards. For this, the state government has appointed nodal officers to ensure transparency in distribution of foodgrains,” the spokesperson said.
