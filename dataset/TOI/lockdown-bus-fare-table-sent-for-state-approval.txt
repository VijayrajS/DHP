2020-05-16
Kolkata: The proposed special lockdown fare table for pvt buses was sent to the transport department for approval on Friday. Earlier, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had left the issue of fixing fare during the lockdown on the bus operators. Accordingly, transport minister Suvendu Adhikary asked the operators to get it approved from the government.

“We have decided the fare after much deliberation and calculation over the operating cost. Since it is a difficult time, we, the bus operators, are not thinking of any profit. We just want the recovery of the operating cost. We hope the government will understand our compulsion and approve the fare,” said Joint Council of Bus Syndicate secretary Tapan Bandyopadhyay.

While the proposed fare for the first 4km is Rs 20 for normal buses, it is Rs 25 for mini buses and Rs 50 for AC buses. The buses, plying according to the new fares are expected to hit the roads from Monday.

During the lockdown, buses are allowed to carry only 20 passengers at a time. The police will keep an eye on whether the lockdown norms are being violated.
