‘Govt can use pvt hospitals, hotels for quarantine’
2020-03-21
Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday slammed protests against the quarantine facility coming up at the ESI hospital in Margao. He told protesters it was the state’s prerogative to decide where a quarantine facility would come up and who would be admitted there.

Rane also stated that in times of an epidemic and under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the department of health services can requisition even private hospitals and hotels to quarantine infected persons.“Some people are telling us where to have a coronavirus quarantine. It is nobody’s jurisdiction to tell us where to have a quarantine. The collector will decide,” Rane said.

The state government has decided to utilise the top two floors of the ESI hospital at Margao to quarantine international and domestic passengers who have travelled to coronavirus hotspots. A 14-day quarantine has been made mandatory for such passengers as a precautionary measure.

Some flights from the Middle East continue to arrive at Goa airport, but with barely any passengers. Those flying in from the UAE are screened and based on symptoms and travel history, are marked for either self-quarantine or government quarantine.

Based on the trajectory taken by the virus in the country and the state, the authorities are empowered to have quarantine facilities across Goa, the health minister said. “I can take over an entire private hospital or hotel if required. We have told private hospitals that we will utilise their facilities if required,” he said.
