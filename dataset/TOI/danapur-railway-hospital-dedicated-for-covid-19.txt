PATNA: The 80-bed Danapur divisional railway hospital has been made Covid-19 dedicated hospital at the advisory of Railway Board. This railway hospital is the first of its kind in the East Central Railway (ECR) to be dedicated for Covid-19 cases.

Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said railways has procured 18 ventilators for the hospital, while orders for 12 more ventilators have been placed with the registered supplier. “We have also tied up with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna for quick disposal of surgical waste materials of the hospital,” he said.

The DRM said in emergency cases, non-corona patients are being referred to railway superspecialty hospital at Karbighaiya. “The outdoor patient department of the hospital has started functioning from the old building for non-Covid cases. Medicine counters are also open at the old building for non-corona OPD patients,” he said.

Chief medical superintendent of Danapur railway hospital Dr R K Verma said railways has also arranged ‘online medical advice’ for patients, mostly railway employees, who are unable to visit the hospital due to the lockdown.

The DRM said in addition to the present strength of railway doctors at the Danapur railway hospital, doctors and experienced nursing staff would be hired on temporary basis for around three months.

The DRM said railways has also developed a 156-bed quarantine facility for the Covid-19 suspects at Madhu Vihar railway colony in Khagaul.
