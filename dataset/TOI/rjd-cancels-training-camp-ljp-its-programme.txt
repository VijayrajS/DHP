PATNA: RJD called off its two-day training camp at Rajgir on March 14 and 15 as the allotment of the convention centre was cancelled after the state government announced several preventive measures against coronavirus on Friday. 


LJP also cancelled its programme under ‘Bihar First Yatra’ scheduled at Madhepura and Saharsa on Saturday. LJP minority cell president Ashraf Ansari said the decision had been taken in view of coronavirus. He said the programme will be held soon.

Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said they had done all the preparation for the event. “Thousands of our workers had already reached there. But we were informed that the allotment of Rajgir Convention Centre had been cancelled,” said Tejashwi. He said the government should have given them special permission. “But we do not want to do politics over it,” he added.

When asked about talks going on to cancel the ongoing Budget session, Tejashwi said, “Personally, I want this session to continue. If legislators are not safe inside assembly, then what will common people will do. What about safety inside buses, at airports and railway stations.”
