NAINITAL: Udham Singh Nagar police late on Thursday booked and arrested eight people after it came to light that they were performing a wedding in contravention to the country-wide lockdown. 


The incident took place in Khatima area of US Nagar district around 11.30 pm when police were informed by some residents that a crowd had gathered at a house in the Islam Nagar locality of Khatima.

“When we reached the spot around midnight, we found that a baraat had travelled from Kichha to ward number three of Islam Nagar area for the wedding. A few people from the locality had also gathered there for the ceremony. However, since the entire country has been under lockdown, this was against the law therefore we stopped the wedding and took them to the police station,” said Khatima SHO Sanjay Pathak.

He added that they arrested and booked eight people including the groom named Salim, his father Faheem, bride’s father Nizakat and two brothers Arbaaz and Shahbaz as well as the kaazi Syed Mohammed Ali performing the ceremony. “We took them to the police station where an FIR was registered. However, all the arrested were let go after they filed for bail,” Pathak said.

The police has invoked section 269 (unlawfully or negligently doing an act which is likely to spread infection), section 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and section 188 (offence of disobedience of an order by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code against all the offenders. 

Pathak said that the area is especially sensitive since eight suspected cases of novel Coronavirus were reported from the area on Thursday as well. While the health department is yet to confirm the reports, the officials said that all of them have been quarantined and, therefore, the police are maintaining vigil so that the crowd does not gather in the area.
