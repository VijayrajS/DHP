2020-05-15
MEERUT: A sudden spike of more than 140 Covid-19 cases in last 12 days has prompted Meerut administration to enforce “watertight” lockdown from Thursday. Although relaxation was announced for medical stores and milk shops, but in reality police did not hesitate to challan even those put to procure daily needs.


The heavy enforcement came after several videos and pictures of blatant flouting of lockdown rules became a cause of embarrassment for the local authorities, accompanied by spike in cases. At present, Meerut has 285 Covid-19 positive cases (including one case in Kanpur) with 17 deaths so far. According to district magistrate Anil Dhingra, the strictness was ensured to “break the chain” of infection. Throughout the day main crossings remained deserted as police fined every commuter who could not explain the reason of his moving out. Senior policemen patrolled all sensitive areas as well.

“Sudden spike of cases in Meerut is a matter of concern and the only way out is the strict enforcement of lockdown. It became necessary when people misused the leniency provided to them. The total lockdown is for their safety,” said ADG Meerut zone Prashant Kumar.

According to SP traffic Sanjeev Bajpai, “Around 1,000 challans were issued and 45 vehicles impounded. Only essential services, like medical stores and milk shops, were allowed to open. Not even kirana stores were open. It was a total lockdown.”
