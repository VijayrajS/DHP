MEERUT: In utter ‘negligence’ of the staff of LLRM Medical College, the newborn of a 31-year-old pregnant woman, who had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 20, was handed over to her family without testing the baby for Coronavirus.


The Meerut chief medical officer has now sought a written reply in the matter from the hospital authorities. The woman gave birth to a baby boy after a caesarean delivery on Friday. Now, all eyes are on the test reports of the baby.

Notably, the woman's case came to light after she went for a regular check-up at a hospital in Begum Pul as her fever continued a little longer. She tested positive at the private facility last Monday. Her husband and the private hospital staff were put under quarantine. Her husband is a vegetable seller. He sells vegetables at Sadar Sabzi Mandi, thereby putting the health department on alert to trace his contact chain.

The woman was traced from Rajban’s Chhota Bazaar area, which was declared a "Covid hotspot" starting Monday midnight, until further orders.

Dr Raj Kumar, the Meerut CMO, said, “This is a matter of utter negligence and a written reply will be sought from the LLRM hospital authorities about it. The testing of the child should have been done before handing him over to the family.”

However, Dr RC Gupta, principal of LLRM Medical College, had something else to say. “Despite the risk involved, we conducted a caesarean delivery. According to protocol, the test of the newborn is conducted a week after he is born, and since somebody has to take care of the child, he was handed over to the family, who have already tested negative,” he said.
