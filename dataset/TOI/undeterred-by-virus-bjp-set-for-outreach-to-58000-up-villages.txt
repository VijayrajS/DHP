Undeterred by coronavirus, BJP set for outreach to 58,000 Uttar Pradesh villages

LUCKNOW: Undeterred by coronavirus threat, the BJP brass has decided to fan out across the state to drum up people’s support by holding ‘chaupal’ in nearly 58,000 villages from March 19-24 to mark the completion of three years of the Yogi Adityanath government in UP.


During the campaign titled ‘Sushasan Ke Teen Varsh’ (three years of good governance), UP ministers, MLAs, MPs and senior party functionaries will hold meetings with people in rural areas and recount achievements of their government.

Talking to TOI, UP BJP general secretary Govind Narain Shukla said, “The idea is to ensure that people-centric steps taken by the Centre and the state government reach the grassroots level.”

He said the party cadre and senior leaders had been asked to take adequate precautions during the campaign in view of coronavirus.

A senior official at the chief minister’s office said the CM’s programme could be altered considering the severity of coronavirus threat.

BJP also plans to hold a special campaign wherein party functionaries would meet parents and students to take feedback on educational system and how it can be improved further.

The move is seen as an attempt by the party to use the occasion to reach out to maximum number of people and lay groundwork for the 2022 assembly election.

According to BJP leaders, every party functionary will be made in charge of at least five villages where they will hold ‘chaupal’ and collect people’s feedback. MLAs and MPs may be asked to reach out to more than five villages.

The party is also planning to revive its Gram Swaraj Abhiyan under which ministers and senior party members camp in villages.
