NEW DELHI: One more primary teacher of a East Delhi Municipal Corporation school passed away after contracting Covid-19 in Bhajanpura area.


Also, another teacher who was engaged in ration distribution from a school in Shakarpur had been found Covid-positive. Her contacts were sent for home isolation of 14 days.

Meanwhile, spokesperson of the east corporation said that the primary teacher passed away from Covid-19, but he had not been deputed on ration distribution duty. “The teacher had pre-existing conditions related to liver. We had not deployed the teacher on Covid-19 duty. His family would get compensation as per normal benefits,” the spokesperson added. 

Teachers unions, however, alleged that the civic body was trying to suppress the matter so that paying ‘special compensation’ could be avoided. “We demand that Rs 1-crore compensation should be given. All teachers would protest by wearing black armbands while doing the duty,” Khatri said. 

The primary teacher was admitted to a private hospital on April 29 and was sent to Lok Nayak Hospital after being tested positive for Covid-19. He passed away on May 11. 

In the past two weeks, several cases of teachers getting infected during ration distribution at centres being run from corporation schools had been found.

With frequent complaints of crowding and mismanagement, teachers unions had been demanding that teachers should not be deployed for this duty. Kuldeep Khatri of Shikshak Nyaya Manch Nagar Nigam said that though teachers were not being paid regularly, they were asked to expose themselves to crowds with high possibility of contacting the infection. Khatri said that he was also on ration distribution duty and had interacted with over 4,000 people in last two days.

“So many cases had been detected but no one was doing anything,” Khatri rued. So far, Covid-positive cases had been confirmed from seven civic schools.
