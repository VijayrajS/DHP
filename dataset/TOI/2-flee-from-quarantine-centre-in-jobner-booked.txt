JAIPUR: Two youths, who were taken to a quarantine centre in Jobner near Jaipur, absconded from there on Friday. According to the police, they were suspected of being infected with Covid-19. The police have registered a case against them. 

The youths were quarantined at the centre set up at Jyoti Mahila Vidyapeeth University in Jobner. They had been shifted to the centre from Jaipur on April 14. 

Kailash Chand, assistant sub-inspector, Jobner police station said, “We received a report that two persons who hailed from Delhi fled from the quarantine centre without informing anyone and we are trying to locate them as absconding in such a way is a criminal offence.” 

Police have registered a case under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Disaster Management Act, 2005, and others. 

On Friday, cops arrested 18 persons in Jaipur for violating Section 144, thus taking the total to 492. Police also seized 306 vehicles and ever since the lockdown was imposed over a month back, over 13,000 vehicles have been seized. 

“We have been enforcing the lockdown strictly to prevent the spread of coronavirus as much as possible. Essential goods are being delivered at home to ensure that people do not need to go out of their homes. We will continue to arrest those who are found violating the lockdown without any valid reasons. Only those in emergency situations can go out, including for medical services,” said a police officer. 

In the state, 1,350 cases have been registered for defying Section 144 and over 3,000 persons arrested for the same. 

Nearly 10,000 persons have been arrested under CrPC Section 151 for loitering on the roads during the lockdown period across Rajasthan. Approximately one lakh vehicles, including both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, have been seized for violating the curfew.
