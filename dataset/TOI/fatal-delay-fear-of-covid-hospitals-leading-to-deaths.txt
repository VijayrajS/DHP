AHMEDABAD: The outbreak of Covid-19 and deteriorating conditions at hospitals have instilled a fear in people, who prefer not to get hospitalized and do so only when their conditions worsen, where some of them are too late and succumb to the novel coronavirus.


TOI spoke to the families of three such patients, who were not ready to go to hospital and ultimately died of the coronavirus.

In the first case, a 55-year-old man from the Vastral area had a cold, cough and fever for around ten days. The person, who was also suffering from hypertension, preferred to consult a local doctor and took medication till Thursday, when he began complained of breathing problems.

On Thursday night, his condition worsened and family had to call the 108 ambulance, which took him to the nearby Shardaben Hospital. At the hospital, he was declared brought dead by doctors.

The deceased’s relatives said he did not want to be hospitalised at the newly set up Covid-19 facility on the Asarwa Civil Hospital campus despite the insistence of his family and other relatives.

Another man from the Asarwa, 45, who worked for a private firm was also suffering from a dry cough for around a fortnight only consulted a local doctor. “He was not ready to go to a Covid-19 designated hospital fearing that he would catch the infection at the hospital only. The increasing number of deaths at Covid-19 hospitals instilled more fear,” said a family member.

This man was also admitted to the Covid-19 hospital on the Asarwa Civil Hospital campus and died on Thursday morning. 

A relative of a 54-year-old woman from the Odhav area of city, who died a week ago, said that they also had a fear of hospitalisation in he corona ward where people were dying of the virus. “My sister had a dry cough for a week and was referred to the Covid-19 hospital at Civil, where she died after being hospitalized for two days,” said the deceased’s brother.
