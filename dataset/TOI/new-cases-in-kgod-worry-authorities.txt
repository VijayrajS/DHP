New Covid-19 cases in Kasaragod worry authorities
2020-04-30
KANNUR: Kasaragod, which has so far successfully contained the spread of Covid-19 in the district, even after becoming the first hotspot in the country, is baffled with two cases reported in the last two days. One is a journalist and the other a person who was not in the primary contact list.


Officials said that they are in the process of preparing the exact route maps to identify the primary contacts of these two.

A 24-year-old resident of Mavungal near Kanhangad, who was not on a primary contact list, tested positive on April 27. He visited Coorg in the first week of March, but it is not sure whether he contracted the infection there or somewhere else.

“We are in the process of tracking his route map in an effort to identify his primary contacts, but it is very complicated,” said Dr AT Manoj, district surveillance officer.

Incidentally, his mother is working in Anandashram, a spiritual retreat in Kanhangad. But there is nothing to panic as she took up external works only, said officials. They have collected her swab sample and a of a few other primary contacts on Wednesday and the test result is expected on Thursday. Also, police are in the process of tracing all his contacts, which might take a couple of days, as his movements and contacts are complicated, said the officials.

The details of the reporter with a TV channel, who tested positive on Wednesday, is also being traced, said the officials, who added that his primary contacts would be asked to go on quarantine and their swab would be collected for testing.

Though 178 positive cases have been reported so far and 165 have been discharged from hospitals, they are all people who came from abroad and their primary contacts. However, in these two cases the route of the infection seems different, and hence the concern.
