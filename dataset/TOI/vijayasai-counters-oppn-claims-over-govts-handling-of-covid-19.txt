Visakhapatnam: YSRC general secretary and Rajya Sabha member V Vijayasai Reddy on Saturday condemned the allegations levelled by opposition leaders over the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the state. 

Stating that he would give out all details on Sunday, Vijayasai said TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu made the state exchequer pay for his properties in foreign nations.

“Naidu should first come out of his house and check the well being of people before making statements. At a time when the state is bearing the brunt of coronavirus, Naidu is sitting in the comfort of his house in Hyderabad and making political statements. Is he the opposition leader of Telangana or AP?” Vijayasai asked.

The YSRC leader also participated in the distribution of essential commodities to people at Chinna Waltair in Vizag and Mogalipuram in Pendurthi assembly constituency. He warned stern action against miscreants if they attack village volunteers who are involved in the distribution of essential services. “Action would be taken against the henchmen of (former MLA) Gandi Babji who attacked village volunteers in Mogalipuram village,” he said.

On Friday, former TDP minister Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy had alleged that the state government has been misleading people by furnishing false details on the number of positive cases in Visakhapatnam district. The TDP leader had claimed that over 80 samples were sent for tests from Vizag several days ago, but not a single result has been announced so far.
