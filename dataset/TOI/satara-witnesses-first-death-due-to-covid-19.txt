Kolhapur: The Satara district administration on Tuesday confirmed that the 63-year-old man who passed away on Monday morning due to cardiac arrest was Covid-19 positive.

District health officer Aniruddha Athalye told TOI that the patient had completed his 14-day quarantine period and according to the protocol his throat swab samples were taken within a span of 24 hours on Sunday and Monday.

“The first sample tested negative, while the second came out as positive. His last rites were performed on Monday morning as per union ministry’s protocol. The patient had returned from California on March 19 and had tested positive on March 24.

District collector Shekhar Singh said the man’s death has been confirmed with cardiac arrest and COVID-19 infection.

“Few photographs of his last rites have gone viral saying that the team at the crematorium did not wear any gloves. This claim is not true. We have taken every precaution to ensure all the safety protocols were followed. The gloves and other protective gears were also disposed in scientific manner,” he said, adding that the administration is committed to the citizens’ safety and there will not be any compromise.

Singh, however, agreed that there were a few hiccups during the last rite process since it was the first death in the district due to Covid-19. “But learning from the instance, we have now assigned duties to the staff concerned and have asked them to follow the protocol. We have also finalized two cremation sites, in Satara and Karad,” he said.

The deceased is survived by his wife and son.
