Covid-19: Italy reports 3,405 deaths, 150 more than China’s, despite fewer infections
2020-03-20
ROME: The death toll in Italy from the coronavirus overtook China’s on Thursday in a stark illustration of how the crisis has pivoted toward the West. Italy, with a population of 60 million, recorded at least 3,405 deaths, or roughly 150 more than in China — a country with a population over 20 times larger. 


Italy tallied 902 deaths in the last two days alone: 475 on Wednesday and 427 on Thursday. The total number of cases rose to 41,035 from a previous 35,713, up nearly 15%, a faster rate of growth than seen over the last three days, the Civil Protection Agency said. 

Italy reached the bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged, recorded no new infections. The worldwide toll crept towards 10,000 as the total number of infections topped 220,000, including nearly 85,000 people who have recovered.

 A visiting Chinese Red Cross team criticised Italians’ failure to properly quarantine themselves and take the national lockdown seriously. The head of the delegation, Sun Shuopeng, said he was shocked to see so many people walking around, using public transportation and eating out. “Right now we need to stop all economic activity and we need to stop the mobility of people,” he said. “All people should be staying at home in quarantine.”

Health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy’s high toll, key among them its large population of elderly people. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population, and the vast majority of its dead — 87% — were over 70.

Spain has been the hardest-hit European country after Italy, and in Madrid a four-star hotel began operating as a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients. The Madrid Hotel Business Association said it has placed 40 hotels with room for 9,000 people at the service of the Madrid region. Spain on Thursday announced that virus deaths had jumped by nearly 30% over the past 24 hours to 803. The number of people who have contracted the disease has meanwhile grown by around 25% to 17,395.

The British government, which was slow to react to the virus, has shifted gears and is now drawing up legislation giving itself new powers to detain people and restrict gatherings. The bill is expected to be approved by parliament next week.

Meanwhile, the WHO warned that the virus is spreading quickly in Africa. “About 10 days ago we had about five countries” with the virus, said WHO’s Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti. Now 35 of Africa’s 54 countries have cases, with the total close to 650. It is an “extremely rapid evolution”, she said. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei planned to pardon 10,000 more prisoners to combat the virus. The country’s toll from coronavirus jumped to 1,284 on Thursday, with the total number of infections rising to 18,407. “Based on our information, every 10 minutes one person dies from the coronavirus and some 50 people become infected with the virus every hour in Iran,” Iran health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur tweeted.
