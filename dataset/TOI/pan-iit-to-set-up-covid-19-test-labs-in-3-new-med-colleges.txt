Pan IIT to set up Covid-19 test labs in 3 new med colleges
2020-05-17
Daltonganj: The state government has roped in Pan IIT Alumni India (Pan IIT), an umbrella organisation representing the alumni of all the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in the country, to set up three Covid-19 testing labs in the three newly established medical colleges in Palamu, Hazaribag and Dumka.

An MoU has been signed in this regard between Pan IIT (Alumni Reach For Jharkhand Foundation) and NRHM, Jharkhand, earlier this week for the purpose, the state health department said. The MoU, a copy of which is with TOI, said an understanding has been reached to set up bio-safety II/III labs, which will have facilities to test the virus, in the three medical colleges.

Chief project officer of PAN IIT of the Jharkhand chapter, Meenakshi Kumar, said, “We visited Palamu Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) two days ago to begin the ground work for setting up of the lab. PMCH principal J R Prasad has done the basics very well and now our team will set up a virology test lab. We are also setting up similar labs in Dumka and Hazaribag medical colleges and hospitals. If all goes well, the labs will be ready within a month.”

Kumar added that their job is restricted to setting up of the labs while the government will rope in another agency for the diagnostic tests.

Prasad said, “A team of Pan IIT came to our college a few days ago and inspected the hall where a test lab is to be set up. All necessary arrangements are in place for the purpose.”

Currently, only four government-run labs are functional for Covid-19 tests, of which two in Ranchi (Rims and Itki), MGM (Jamshedpur) and PMCH (Dhanbad). Three private hospitals, namely Medica (Ranchi), TMH (Jamshedpur) and BGH (Bokaro), are likely to begin tests soon. Moreover, the state government has given its approval to four private diagnostic centres to collect samples and conduct tests.
