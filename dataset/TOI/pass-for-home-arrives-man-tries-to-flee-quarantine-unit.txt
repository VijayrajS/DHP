GREATER NOIDA: The pass to go home had arrived, the Covid report hadn’t. Krishan Kumar approached doctors, but they told him to wait. He picked up his bag, sneaked out of the room and managed to give guards the slip. But the escape was shortlived.

The 31-year-old Krishan was caught by guards at the main gate while trying to flee a quarantine centre at Galgotias University on Sunday. Originally from Jharkhand, Krishan worked at a factory in Faridabad and stayed in Gijhodh village in Sector 53. After a man from his locality tested positive, he was brought to the quarantine centre on Friday as part of protocol.

Desperate to go home, Krishan had applied for an e-pass seven days ago. But before that arrived, he was sent to quarantine. On Sunday, he came to know that his pass had arrived and approached the authorities at the centre with an appeal to discharge him.

“He approached the doctors, but was told to wait. According to the new guidelines, he could have been discharged since he was asymptomatic. However, he did not wait for that and slipped out of his room on the third floor. He had reached the main gate and was about to flee when the guards noticed him and brought him back,” said Dr Anil Gupta, in-charge of the centre.

A police team arrived at the centre and lodged a case against Krishan under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) on the complaint of a policeman who had chased him.

Since an FIR has now been registered against him, a decision would be taken on Monday on whether to allow Krishan to go home anytime soon.
