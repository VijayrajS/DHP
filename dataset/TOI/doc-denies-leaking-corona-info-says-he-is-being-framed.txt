2020-02-12
HYDERABAD: In his defence, Dr Vasant Kumar denied having leaked any information on the coronavirus cases. He said that he had complained about irregularities in the functioning of the hospital which is why he is was at the receiving end of such accusations. 


“I have not done anything wrong. I am being falsely implicated for being a whistle-blower. There are scams in this hospital that are even bigger than the ESI scam. There are irregularities involving sanitation, age hike, security and drug purchase. I am being wrongly implicated for pointing them out. I have not leaked any information about corona cases. I am not foolish to do so,” said Dr Kumar, speaking to media persons at Gandhi hospital, before he was removed by cops.

Meanwhile, the medical JAC of hospitals held a meeting and came out in support of Dr Vasant Kumar demanding an inquiry into the allegations of corruption levied against the hospital. “How can the authorities take action against Dr Vasant without asking for his explanation? He is the association leader of Telangana Government Doctors Association. No cases should be filed against him without proof and allegations made by him should be probed,” said Bongu Ramesh, chairman of the JAC.
