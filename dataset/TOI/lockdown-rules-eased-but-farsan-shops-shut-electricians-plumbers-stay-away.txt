Lockdown rules eased but farsan shops shut, electricians & plumbers stay away
2020-04-21
Mumbai: Despite an official relaxation in lockdown restrictions for mithai and farsan shops, carpenters, plumbers and electricians from Monday, most establishments and individuals were unable to restart activity. Until shops open, workers cannot purchase parts, tools and raw materials. Moreover, manpower is at a low ebb.

Chivda Galli in Lalbaug is a hub of farsan manufacturers. None reopened their shops on Monday. Shankar Kale of Vijaylaxmi Farsan said, “My workers live in Vikhroli, Chembur and Dombivli and are unable to travel to Lalbaug in the absence of local trains.” Another shopowner said, “The steady availability of raw material needed to manufacture farsan is not guaranteed either. Basic items such as curry leaves, condiments and rice flakes are out of stock. If we reopen, the government should be able to assure us that supplies will reach us unhindered regularly.” 

Mithai shops, too, are unable to procure adequate milk, mawa, ghee and food colour.

Rajesh Kumar of Mahalaxmi farsan and sweet shop in Bhandup said his outlet opened but home deliveries were held up due to housing society restrictions. Besides, police action against fruit and vegetable vendors has made store employees worry about their own fate.

In Kalina, too, electricians depend on hardware shops to buy parts and these were closed. 

Ramkrishna Das (30), a plumber in Kharghar, said, “I received a call from a regular customer in Sector 15 for replacing a kitchen tap but shops are shut.” Electrician Jitendra Gupta (25) from Vashi said, “In case a fuse is burnt, it’s not possible to replace it.” Carpenter Shyamlal Lohar (45) said, “For making new furniture, we require plywood, screws, nuts and bolts. Where can we buy these?”
