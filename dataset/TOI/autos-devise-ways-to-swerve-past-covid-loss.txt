Autos devise ways to swerve past Covid loss
2020-05-31
Kolkata: In the new pandemic normal, autos are allowed to ferry just two instead of four passengers. To compensate for the loss, many routes have come up with innovative ways instead of increasing the fare substantially. There were, however, some routes that fleeced passengers at will.

On Sinthee-Dum Dum Metro route, for instance, auto operators have truncated the route — Sinthee-30A bus stand for Rs7 and 30A bus stand-Dum Dum Metro for Rs 6 — instead of revising the fare. The fare for Sinthee to Dum Dum in Rs 9. “If the first half of total number of autos run the first half of the route length (Sinnthee- 30A) on Monday, rest of the autos will run the second route length (from 30A to Dum Dum) on Monday. Next day, each set will change of route,” said Shankar Pradhan, a route committee member. On Hazra-Bondel Gate route, the route length has been trifurcated — Hazra-Sishu Mangal, Sishu Mangal-Ballygunge Phanri and Ballygunge Phanri-Bondel Gate. 

One of the key reasons for not charging an abruptly high fare is low demand. Another big reason is the substantial reduction of auto LPG price from Rs 44/kg in April to 32.4/kg from May 1. The reduction of Rs 11.6/kg is also being used as buffer, said Aniruddha Kar, a transport economist. 

However, there are some routes — Dunlop-Barrackpore, Ultadanga-Karunamoyee and Ultadanga-Phoolbagan, among others — that continued to fleece commuters. Police received multiple complaints against such routes. In some, autos are accused to have charged almost triple the regular fare. In others, the auto operators are plying with more than two passengers citing “peak-hour pressure.”

“There are reports that the Ultadanga-Baguiati route is breaking rules,”said an officer. Similar complaints have come from the Beliaghata ID-Phoolbagan-RG Kar and the Thakurpukur-Taratala routes. DC (traffic) Rupesh Kumar said they were in touch with the transport department in this regard.
