2020-04-15
HYDERABAD: A 65-year-old woman from Hyderabad's old city, who was declared Covid-19 positive after she died on April 11, has infected nothing less than 17 members of her family with the virus. 

This is the highest number of positive cases detected in one family in Telangana so far. Health officials say it is also an indication of the extreme speed at which the virus can jump from one person to another.

A worrying factor is that officials have no clue how the woman contracted the virus. They have joined hands with municipal authorities to intensify contact tracing and started a house-to-house survey the area.


Residents voluntarily put barricades in Old City area
 Authorities are also taking extra precautions in the old city's Talab Katta area where the woman lived given that her funeral was completed even before her positive test results arrived.

 Samples of as many as 41 persons, including family members and neighbours, were collected on April 13 after which the family members, including two minors, tested positive. The affected persons have been shifted to Gandhi Hospital for treatment while the remaining have been put in isolation wards in Nizamia Unani Hospital. 

As news of the woman's death and test results spread in the old city, many residents voluntarily put up barricades to prevent outsiders from entering their localities. The government has also declared the area around her house a containment zone and restricted movement of people.

The woman had been suffering from a heart ailment and was taken to a private hospital for initial treatment. Later, she developed complications and was shifted to Gandhi Hospital where the doctors collected her blood samples.

After she died, the family members performed her funeral at a graveyard in Begum Bazaar area. It was only after this that the test results arrived.
