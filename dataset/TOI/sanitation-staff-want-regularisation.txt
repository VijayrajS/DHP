Sanitation staff in Covid-19 wards of Hyderabad's Gandhi Hospital want regularisation
2020-05-06
HYDERABAD: Sanitation workers in Covid-19 wards of Gandhi Hospital are boycotting the duties for the last two days, demanding regularisation of their jobs, better wages and incentives. They said they have been paid Rs 8,000 a month for the last 15 years and demanded hike in their salaries. They also demanded incentives like other medical workers get since Gandhi hospital has been designated as a Covid-19 hospital.


“We do all the work like even packing the bodies. We are at a greater risk than any worker here. The government should recognise our services,” Venkat, a sanitation worker, said. All the workers are employed under a private contractor on an outsourcing basis.

They also pointed out that GHMC sanitation workers get incentives but they are denied such a facility. “Floral tributes for us are fine but we are ignored completely despite our hard work,” another worker said. “We want a reasonable pay,” he added. Recently, some sanitation staff were showered with petals for working during the lockdown.

Another worker, who resides on the city outskirts, said she was not allowed to enter her village as residents thought she might be carrying coronavirus.
