Announce Rs 2k cr aid package for Covid-hit: MGP
2020-05-24
Panaji: With no financial relief forthcoming from the Centre, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) on Friday demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant announce a financial package for the people affected due to the Covid-19 lockdown.

The government had sought a minimum of Rs 2,000 crore for the state as the mining and tourism industries had both come to a halt, further straining state finances.

Speaking to mediapersons, senior MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that Sawant should reveal to the people of Goa the amount of aid money the state was entitled to, from the Rs 20 lakh crore financial package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“After reviewing the package, I realised that there is nothing for Goa in it,” he said. Dhavalikar said that the state has been allowed to borrow Rs 4,450 crore as a loan, which is 3 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).He also said the state cannot borrow this loan to pay salaries or repay pending loans, but can utilise it only for development.

 “The government needs around Rs 1,000 crore to clear the bills of developmental works undertaken by various departments. The expenditure is more than the revenue of the state ,” he said.
