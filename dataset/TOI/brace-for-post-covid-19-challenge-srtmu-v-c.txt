Aurangabad: Udhav Bhosle, vice-chancellor for Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwadad University (SRTMU), Nanded, on Friday appealed to teachers and students to gear up for facing challenges that may arise after Covid-19 pandemic phase gets over.

“The outbreak of novel coronavirus has not only shaken India but also entire world. Even if the spread of the virus gets contained in the near future, the education system will have to brace for sea-change in the teaching-learning process. Every stakeholder must develop a clear understanding about what lies ahead and gear up accordingly,” he said in a public address through social media.

Sharing his views on post Covid-19 era in the field of education, Bhosle said that the online platforms and e-resources would be used more than before in future.

“Every student and teacher must develop a sound understanding of online tools available for teaching and learning. The e-education ahead will also have lot of scope for self-learning and students as well as teachers develop their mindsets accordingly,” the V-C said.

Appealing to the students to focus on the brighter side of the situation, Bhosle said the beginning of online era in the field of education have opened multiple avenues of e-learning. According to him, these avenues never got due attention in the past. “Open and free sources of knowledge have been there for last some years, but its utilisation was not taking place to the full potential so far.,” he said.
