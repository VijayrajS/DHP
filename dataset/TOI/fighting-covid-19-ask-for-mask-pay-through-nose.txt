Fighting coronavirus: Ask for mask, pay through nose
2020-03-11
COLVA: Panic over coronavirus and the resultant demand for masks has opened a new avenue for pharmacists to cash in on with some creating artificial shortage.

In Margao, pharmacy owners under the garb of rationing sales are selling two masks per person, and that too at a higher price.

A disposable face mask which is available under normal circumstances at Rs 15 is being sold at Rs 20 to Rs 40, while the reusable N-95 and 3M versions, which generally costs, Rs 80 to Rs 100, are offered in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 350.

The reusable masks contain filters and can be used over a week with a simple rinse in water. Some pharmacies in the commercial capital of Goa have already exhausted their stock and those who have inventory, are jacking up the prices.

A customer at a pharmacy seeking six masks had to remain content with just two, and that too at Rs 35 per piece. She told TOI that just last week she had paid Rs 20 for the same mask.

Another pharmacist said that before the outbreak of coronavirus, his sale of disposable masks was just 2-3 a day and the target group was two-wheeler riders. But now, he makes daily sales of 30-50 reusable masks.

The sale of sanitizers and liquid soaps has also increased three-fold.

One of the pharmacists who has run out of stock disclosed that her order for fresh consignment is pending since last week.

A senior citizen said when demand competes with supply, then unethical business practices come into play.
