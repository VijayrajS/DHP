Kanglish music video inspires in battle against Covid-19
2020-04-15
Mangaluru: India’s fight against Covid-19 got a musical edge to it with ‘namma huduga’ Guru Kiran’s Kanglish video, ‘Corona We Will Kill You’ rocking with his fans since its release on YouTube, late on Monday. Such has been its impact in this short span of time, that the celebrated music director, an alumnus of Mangalore University, has since decided to bring out a peppier video version with Corona Warriors featuring in it, later this month.

The 140-second YouTube offering is the result of a suggestion by actor Tara, that Sandalwood too must do its bit in the nation’s fight against Covid-19, said Guru Kiran. Noting that he normally quarantines himself in his studio to get the creative juices flowing, Guru Kiran said the lockdown gave work from home, a whole new meaning, as he was able to bring out this video with limited resources at his disposal.

“Sri, from Crazy Minds, a visual film editor, helped in this musical effort,” Guru Kiran said, adding the larger effort was to bring out a video version with bits and pieces performances from Bollywood actors. However, with this initial effort already uploaded on YouTube, Guru Kiran said the video version will be a more elaborate and better planned effort, which will also feature those on the front lines of fighting this epidemic, like doctors, police personnel and sanitary workers.

With this present video underscoring the idea ‘Irona Nam Nam Maneyalli….” (let us all stay in our homes), Guru Kiran also bats for Sandalwood, urging all those devouring content on Netflix and other such streaming platforms to watch Kannada films on over- the-top (OTT) apps. His video has been lapped up across various social media platforms, including Kannada entertainment channels.
