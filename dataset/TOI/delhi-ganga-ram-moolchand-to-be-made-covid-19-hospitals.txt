2020-06-04
New Delhi: The Delhi government on Wednesday declared three private hospitals functioning on concessional land as Covid hospitals. These are Moolchand Hospital, which has 140 beds, Saroj Super Specialty Hospital with 154 beds and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, which has 508 beds. 

According to the order issued by state health secretary Padmini Singla, Moolchand and Saroj Super Specialty hospital will have to give 100% of their beds for Covid-19 patients and SGRH 80%. 

"SGRH is allowed to keep up to 20% beds for treatment of non-Covid patients," the government order states. 


25% of Covid beds in three hospitals free for the poor
It adds that 25% of the total Covid beds in these three hospitals shall be free for EWS patients.

The government has said the action follows a surge in the number of positive cases of Covid-19 in the last one week in Delhi, resulting in additional demand for beds in hospital isolation wards as well as in the ICU.

The government’s new order comes days after another directive to private hospitals and nursing homes with a capacity of 50 beds or more to reserve at least 20% of their beds for coronavirus patients.

“Delhi government felt an imperative need to increase the number of beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients. Hence, all 117 private hospitals/nursing homes with a capacity of 50 beds or more have been directed to reserve 20% of their total bed strength,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted on May 24.
