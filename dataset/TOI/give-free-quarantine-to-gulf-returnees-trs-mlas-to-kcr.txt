2020-05-23
HYDERABAD: Four TRS legislators have written to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to provide free government quarantine instead of paid quarantine to Telangana workers returning from the Gulf. The joint letter was signed by MLAs of the erstwhile Karimnagar district — Chennamaneni Ramesh of Vemulawada constituency, K Vidyasagar Rao of Korutla, M Sanjay Kumar of Jagtial and Ravi Shankar of Choppadandi.


In the letter, the ruling party MLAs said in view of the coronavirus pandemic and closure of a number of companies in various Gulf countries, a large number of Telangana workers have lost their jobs and some of them have decided to come back to Telangana

“A large number of the workers hail from northern Telangana districts. In view of their financial difficulties, we request you to approve the provision of government quarantine with basic amenities to all those who would like to avail it,” they said.

The Gulf workers, as part of the ‘deeksha’ they undertook in the state and also in the Gulf, wore black masks to bring to the attention of the government their inability to pay for their quarantine in Telangana. They also urged the government to provide for their airfare. 

Bheem Reddy Mandha, president, Emigrants Welfare Forum, thanked the MLAs for their iniative and urged them to pay special attention in providing free quarantine to all the workers who return.
