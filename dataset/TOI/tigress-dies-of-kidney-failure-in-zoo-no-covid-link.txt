NEW DELHI: A Delhi zoo tigress died after suffering kidney failure, zoo officials said on Friday. The animal — Kalpana (13) — whose postmortem examination has been carried out, was also the oldest big cat at the zoo. The zoo later sent the samples for testing for Covid-19 as a precautionary measure. Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) later confirmed that the tiger had tested negative for the virus.

“After the positive case from the Bronx zoo, we had received strict instructions from the Central Zoo Authority to improve sanitation measures and maintain suitable distance from carnivores, especially during feeding. The food is also being sanitised and boiled before it is fed to the animals,” said a zoo official.

Tigers have an average age of 10-15 years, depending on the habitat and living conditions. A source said the animal was found to be ill on Tuesday, with high creatinine levels in the body, along with dehydration. The animal didn’t respond to the treatment and died on Wednesday.

Delhi zoo director, Dr Suneesh Buxy, said the death occurred due to old age and kidney failure, stating it was a natural death. “She was the oldest big cat at the zoo, at thirteen years and 7 months. She had stopped eating over the last week. A postmortem examination has revealed renal failure as the cause of death,” said Buxy.

A Union environment ministry official said only a few veterinary officers were present during the autopsy “Samples were sent to IVRI in Bareilly for testing,” said the official.
