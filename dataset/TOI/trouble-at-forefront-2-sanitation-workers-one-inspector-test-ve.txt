NEW DELHI: Two sanitation workers in south Delhi and one assistant sanitary inspector (ASI) in Rohini have tested positive for novel coronavirus, raising concerns about the safety of staff deployed at the forefront.

The ASI, who is from Wazirpur, is currently admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital, a senior corporation official said. The assistant commissioner of Rohini zone, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, has directed 39 sanitation workers who were in direct contact with the inspector to go into home quarantine.

North commissioner Varsha Joshi said the official had no contact with any positive patient, but was asked to stay at home when he started to show symptoms. “All his contacts have been sent into home quarantine, while his family is being tested. We will take every care till he fully recovers,” she added. All the 39 employees are currently asymptomatic, but are being monitored.

A South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official said that one of two sanitation workers who tested positive was posted in Bhogal of Daryaganj ward. “The worker was suffering from liver-related ailment and was admitted to AIIMS on Wednesday. He is currently on ventilator,” the official added.

SDMC spokesperson Radha Kirshan said the worker had only reported for duty twice this month and had not been posted to any hotspot or disinfection work.

In the second case, a woman employee from 6S Tagore Garden ward was also admitted to LNJP. “Her husband is a safai sainik and has tested negative. He has been called for a fresh test. Both of them are residents of Mangolpuri,” Krishan said. Nine of her colleagues in Tagore Garden have been sent on home quarantine.

Meanwhile, to protect its sanitary staff, north corporation has issued new guidelines according to which every worker will undergo thermal screening before their shift.

In the past few days, multiple cases of sanitation workers testing positive have emerged and unions have threatened the civic bodies to either improve the working conditions or face their ire.

Sanjay Gahlot, head, Delhi Akhil Bharatiya Safai Mazdoor Sangh, said two cases in east and multiple cases emerging from other local bodies have shown that sanitation workers were not being provided adequate protection. “Only some workers have been given masks and gloves, which should be changed daily. Sanitation staff are going well beyond their duties, but it is shameful that the corporations are playing with their lives,” he added.
