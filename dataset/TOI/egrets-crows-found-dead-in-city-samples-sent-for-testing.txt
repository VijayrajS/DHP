Thiruvananthapuram: Stray incidence of bird deaths in the district triggered bird-flu scare on Wednesday. Bird deaths were reported in the city at Azhoor and Karode panchayats. Three egrets were found dead on a tree on the premises of MLA hostel. The fire force retrieved the carcass and officials with animal husbandry department sent the samples to State Institute for Animal Diseases (SIAD) to identify the cause of death. More than 30 crows were also reported dead at Azhoor and Karode panchayats and samples from these places were also sent to SIAD, Palode.

Officials with animal husbandry department (AHD) said that samples were sent for detailed tests in the wake of bird flu outbreak in Kozhikode where avian influenza was confirmed in domestic poultry, forcing mass culling of birds. “We sent the samples to SIAD as a precautionary measure. The state already has a confirmed case of avian flu in Kozhikode and we have to take precautions,” said an AHD official.

The carcass received at SIAD was in a putrefied state. The district is not known to have reported avian flu in recent times and according to officials there was no need to panic. The SIAD team will do a preliminary investigation and even if avian flu is suspected, it has to be confirmed by the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal. The samples will be tested in Palode on Thursday and in case of suspicion, the samples will be sent to Bhopal for confirmation. As per protocol, NIHSAD will communicate the findings to the Government of India and then a communication will be sent to the chief secretary, following which an official notification will be issued.

AHD officials and veterinarians said that the deaths of egrets and crows during summer many not be a cause of panic and these could be isolated incidents. Extreme heat stress could be one reason for the death of egrets. 

Sometimes deaths also happen due to poisoning or bacterial infection, animal disease specialists said. The nature of the influenza virus is such that it has high mutation rates and undergoes frequent genetic reassortment (combination and rearrangement of genetic material) rendering vaccinations ineffective.

 The lone preventive mechanism is culling and containment which was what the officials did in Alappuzha in 2014.

The carcasses of egrets also became a topic of discussion in the assembly session, with MLA P C George demanding a probe into the death of egrets.
