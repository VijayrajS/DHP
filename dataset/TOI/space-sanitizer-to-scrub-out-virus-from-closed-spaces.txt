‘Space sanitizer’ to scrub out virus from closed spaces
2020-05-28
AHMEDABAD: Assisted by Gujarat based incubation centre – iCreate, Kanpur-based entrepreneurs have developed a space sanitizer, which uses negative ions to scrub out viruses from the air, especially in closed spaces like homes, offices and other workplaces.

The device, which resembles an LED lamp, cleans up the air in a room within an hour. It consumes less than five watts of electricity and can be kept plugged into a socket and operated continuously with no side effects.

Ashish Kanaujia had the idea of using negative air ions to scrub the air clean by removing all the ‘vehicles’ which the virus uses to transmit itself from one person to another. He packed the system inside a low-cost, easy to use bulb housing to make it user friendly for laymen. Most of the Covid hotspots in India have developed where people have been in close contact with each other in closed spaces.

Working in the difficult lockdown period, innovators Navneet Pal and Ankit Sharma worked on developing the product, even as the iCreate team guided them remotely through their work.

“The product has been priced at Rs 2,000 but it can be customized depending on the size of the room,” said Navneet Pal. He added that they intend to make the product available on other e-commerce platforms as well.

iCreate’s Anupam Jalote said, “Ashish and Navneet have used core science and adapted it quickly to create a product that is affordable and easy to use by the common man, and it is very effective. In my opinion, this is the highest level of innovation.”
