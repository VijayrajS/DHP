Covid workers get nod for 20% pay hike
2020-05-13
PANAJI: After Chief minister Pramod Sawant announced a 20% hike in basic pay to the staff engaged in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, the proposal has been granted in-principle approval. 

An official said that releasing additional funds to Covid-19 frontline workers may take a little while as details are being sought from the directorate of health services and GMC about the beneficiaries.

“We will be able to release 20% additional salaries to the frontline workers after the list is obtained,” the official said. The additional salaries will be released from state funds.

It is expected that benefit will accrue to all frontline workers, regular as well as contract employees who may be engaged for Covid duties, he said. This includes housekeeping, facility management, ambulance and security staff. The official however said that since not all security and other staff of the GMC were connected with services for fighting off Covid-19, not all can get the benefits and hence specific details were requested.

 Also, staff posted at ESI will also be considered for 20 % increase in pay. 

The increase in pay is counted for three months starting from March, and if their duties get extended, it may be considered, subject to approval of the government, he added.
