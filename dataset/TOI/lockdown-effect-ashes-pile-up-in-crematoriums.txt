2020-05-17
JAIPUR: Crematoriums in the city are piling up with ashes of the deceased as their kin are unable to visit Haridwar or Pushkar for immersion of the remains due to lockdown. This has emerged as a big challenge for crematorium owners who are running out of space to keep the ashes. 


Halighati crematorium Prem Chandani administrator of says that the lockers provided at the crematoriums are full. “We provide lockers to people who can keep the ashes for a time being till they are able to go to Haridwar or Pushkar. People usually go for immersion on the third day of death but these are unusual times. For months, ashes are lying in the lockers. All the lockers are full and now we have to open our store room to make space for ashes,” said Chandani. Similarly, Cheelgati crematorium administrator Anil Sharma said because of space crunch, they are keeping containers of ashes in whatever place is available. “Lockers are full and we are forced to keep ashes on the floor. It will be a while when people will be able to travel for immersion. Till then we are expecting that piling up will continue,” said Sharma. 

Residents of the city are demanding some relaxation in rules for immersion. City resident Krishna Mahrishi said, “I went for a funeral of my close relative a few days back. The fact we were not able immerse the ashes has affected our family emotionally. I don’t know for how long this will continue, but the government should give us some passes to immerse it in Pushkar city.” Before lockdown relaxations, crematoriums were facing shortage of firewood.
