Bareilly: The number of novel coronavirus cases in Moradabad rose to 37 on Saturday with seven new cases, including a 10-month-old boy and his five-year-old sister, being reported since Friday night. 

According to sources, except a 63-year-old woman, all the other new cases are linked to Tablighi Jamaat members.

Keeping in view the rising number of cases, 10 more areas in Moradabad city were declared as hotspots. The city has a total of 18 hotspots at present — Lalnagari, Tabela, Barvalan, Chamunda Mandir Barvalan, Khijaravali mosque, Kunwarshah lane, Lal School lane, Garyovali mosque in Galshaheed, Aysha mosque Azadnagar, Islam Road Asalatpura, Tambakuvalan, Nawabpura, Maqbara police outpost area, Ulal Bagh, Karula, Peergaib, Peerjada and Naivali mosque.

Chief medical officer Dr MC Garg said that the two children who tested positive are the relatives of a couple who had already tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, the parents of the children tested negative for Covid-19. 

The four Tablighi Jamaat members who tested positive are a native of Jaunpur district, one from Assam and two from Jammu and Kashmir. All of them were staying at Mugalpura.

Meanwhile, health officials expressed concern that the Tablighi Jamaat members might have come in contact with more people in the area. 

However, doctors and family members of the 63-year-old woman are clueless about how she contracted the disease as she has neither come in contact with any Covid-19 positive person nor has any travel history. Even though her son was also quarantined as a precaution, his test results came negative. 

Meanwhile in Sambhal, one more person tested positive for the infection, taking the total number of cases in the district to eight.
