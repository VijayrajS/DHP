AGRA: The Bengaluru techie’s wife who tested positive for Covid-19 infection a fortnight ago, is expected to be discharged from isolation facility on Thursday.


A senior doctor of the isolation facility at S N Medical College said, “Both samples of the 25-year-old woman, sent to KGMU and Aligarh’s JNMC on Tuesday and Wednesday, have tested negative. We expect her to be discharged on Thursday.”

Unaware of her infection, the asymptomatic woman had landed from Bengaluru at New Delhi airport early morning on March 9, after returning from honeymoon in Europe. She later boarded Gatimaan Express to reach Agra. Her husband too was admitted in a Bengaluru hospital with Covid-19 infection.
