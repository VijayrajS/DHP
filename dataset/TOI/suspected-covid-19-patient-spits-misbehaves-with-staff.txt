Ludhiana: A quarantined patient reportedly misbehaved inside the male isolation ward of the civil hospital on Friday. The 22-year-old from Gagan Nagar, New Shimlapuri, who was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday, spat all over the ward from Friday morning to noon and misbehaved with the staff too.Cleaners and Class IV employees raised the issue with the authorities, but he refused to cooperate with doctors too.A doctor said, “He was not cooperating with the staff and since morning was spitting all around at nursing station, on tiles of male isolation ward, floor, handles and even taps of washrooms. He also rolled himself on all the beds of isolation ward. We immediately locked him up in a four-bed isolation ward and called a psychiatrist.”Doctors wrote to the senior medical officer (SMO), who complained to the police. SMO Dr Ravi Dutt said, “This sort of behaviour when the whole country is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions is indefensible. We can only hope that better sense prevails. We have raised the issue of misbehaviour and non-cooperation with the health authorities and lodged a complaint at Division 2 police station.”Earlier too, two cases were reported from the civil hospital wherein two Covid-19 suspects had fled from the isolation ward. As many as 53 patients are admitted at the civil hospital isolation ward. On Friday, six throat swabs were sent to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala. Five positive patients have been quarantined in separate isolation wards. There are six rooms in one isolation ward.
