In the temple city of Tirupati in Chittoor district, where all major temples including, Lord Venkateswara temple, have been shut down to pilgrims, hotels, restaurants, fast-food joints and eateries, commercial establishments and shops, educational institutions, colleges and universities, state and central government offices, banks and other financial institutions, etc, remained shut throughout day. Consequently, all important arterial junctions wore a deserted look.

Similarly, janata curfew was observed in chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s home district Kadapa. The ever-busy Koti Reddy Circle, bus stations, railway stations, vegetable markets, commercial streets etc, wore a deserted look throughout the day. 

In Anantapur district, people who completed their last minute purchases of essential goods by Saturday, did not venture out of their homes, and extended complete support to janata curfew.

In Kurnool district, prominent places of worship at Srisailam, Ahobilam and Mantralayam and other parts of the district remained closed. The famous Konda Reddy Buruju circle, which is always abuzz with activity remained empty throughout the day, except for the presence of a few police personnel.
