2020-04-28
Mysuru/Madikeri: Dengue cases in neighbouring Kodagu district have put the authorities in Mysuru district on alert. 

Two dengue cases were identified in Kodagu. A man from Sampaje and a girl from Sunticoppa tested positive for dengue. However, both also recovered. This year from January onwards the district has witnessed seven dengue cases. All of them have been cured, said Dr Mohan, district health officer. 

Even though Mysuru district health department reported zero dengue cases in April, the health department launched an awareness drive to ensure that it will not further burden the administrative machinery which is grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic.

For last one week, the department launched door to door survey and awareness programmes along with the Covid 19 related activities. 

Seven dengue and 12 chikungunya cases have been reported from Mysuru district till March this year.

Authorities say that last year half of those who tested positivefor dengue in the district were from Bengaluru as the patients were either studying or employed in Bengaluru.

Dr Chidambar, district vector-borne diseases control officer, stated that all precautionary measures are being taken to contain the spread of dengue and chikungunya. Since people are at home during lockdown, it has become comparatively easier to ensure cleanliness in localities and prevent breeding of mosquitoes and spreading of the disease, he added. 

Dr MG Satish Kumar of Columbia Asia Hospital said the lockdown has helped in keeping vector-borne diseases under check. He, however, warned that cases may go up during the monsoon.
