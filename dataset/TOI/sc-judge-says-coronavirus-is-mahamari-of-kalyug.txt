2020-03-19
NEW DELHI: Terming coronavirus outbreak as a kind of ‘Mahamari’ (pandemic) which human civilisation had to face in each century, Supreme Court Judge Arun Mishra said that not only the government but people should fight this battle by taking precautionary measures to contain its spread.


“See the frailty of human being. It is Kalyug that is why humans are fighting against virus and it is so difficult,” Justice Mishra said while expressing concern over the cornonavirus outbreak. He said senior advocates should not bring many junior advocates inside court room and only one junior lawyer should be allowed to prevent crowding of courtroom.

He also agreed with the suggestion of senior advocate C S Sundaram that only matters relating to personal liberty of a person should be taken up for hearing in SC as a precautionary measure. The advocate said the Supreme Court should pass an order to keep orders passed by HCs on death penalty, demolition etc in abeyance for some time so that people would not rush to the apex court for relief.

Justice Mishra said he will talk to the Chief Justice of India on the issue and asked the lawyers also to make representation before the CJI.
