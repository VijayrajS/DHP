2020-05-29
PANAJI: After filing a police complaint against chief minister Pramod Sawant for defying Section 144 during the inauguration of the grade separator at Dabolim, Goencho Avaaz on Thursday filed another complaint against Sawant and urban development minister Milind Naik for defying orders and inaugurating a new ferry boat at Panaji jetty.


Goencho Avaaz co-convenor Swapnesh Sherlekar filed the complaint, and accused the CM of being a “repeat offender”. He also called for Sawant and his ministers to be prosecuted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code.

“The provisions in the orders of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) does not exempt public gatherings by government officials, and in no case permits any governmental function to be carried out without maintaining social distancing,” Sherlekar said.

Goencho Avaaz said that Sawant is setting a “bad precedent” which would be brought to the Prime Minister’s notice. “Is such undue hurry to undertake inauguration of structures or laying of foundation stones a means to influence the people and a signal that the zilla panchayat polls are likely to be announced?”
