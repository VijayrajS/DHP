Oxygen supply for all beds at multi-speciality block of MGMGH to admit more Covid cases
2020-06-14
TRICHY: All the 350 beds in the multi-speciality block at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital will be equipped with oxygen supply, in anticipation of another spell of Covid-19 outbreak. However, even though oxygen supply pipeline was installed in the old buildings on the campus and Covid-19 patients were shifted to reopen outpatient facility, the hospital administration said it will be difficult to reopen it fully considering the rising number of cases.

The six-storey multi-specialty and trauma care building on MGM campus was converted for Covid-19 care since the last week of March. Since then entry to the hospital was restricted with security guards preventing entry of attendants to the campus. As the outpatient treatment for several ailments including non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc came to a halt, patients were given with medicines for two months to prevent their visit to the hospital. 

On Saturday, dean K Vanitha and medical superintendent R Yeganathan were inspected the oxygen pipe installation work. “Our hospital has four high-flow nasal oxygen equipment that can be moved for oxygen supply from the pipeline that is being laid in the hospital now,” said Dr Yeganathan. 

Intensive care units of the hospital have already been equipped with 82 ventilators. 

“Keeping Covid-19 patients at the six-storey building and allowing other patients for treatment would lead to infection. Hence, the hospital administration in consultation with Trichy district administration decided to shift the Covid-19 patients to other buildings on the campus last week to allow other departments to resume treatment,” said a source. 

The sudden spike in cases has prompted the hospital administration to equip the hospital with more facilities like oxygen supply which is usually installed in ICUs.
