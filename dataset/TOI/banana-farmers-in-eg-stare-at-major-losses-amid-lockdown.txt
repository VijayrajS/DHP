Banana farmers in EG stare at major losses amid lockdown
2020-04-14
KAKINADA: Banana farmers in East Godavari have been severely hit by the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. According to estimates, the farmers could lose nearly 50% of their costs this year.


While the state government is rolling out measures to help the farmers, the lack of demand has put them in a fix. Marriages being postponed and temples being closed has led to a fall in the demand for bananas. Bananas are cultivated across 13,000 hectares across East Godavari district. 

Meesala Raju, a banana farmer-trader from Ambajipeta, said that a tenant farmer spends around Rs 1.5 lakh on each acre including lease and it will be difficult to recover even 50% of the investment.

“Meanwhile, prices have declined drastically. The price of the Chakrakeli variety has come down from Rs 250 a bunch to Rs 100 a bunch,” Raju said while adding that the lack of storage facilities is hurting banana farmers the most during the crisis. 

Konda Reddy, president of Ravulapalem Agriculture Market Committee Traders’ Association said that the price of one tonne banana has come down from Rs 8,000-10,000 to Rs 4,000-5,000.

He said that around 12,000 bunches of banana would come into the market every day before the lockdown. The number has come down to around 3,000 bunches now.

N Mallikharjuna Rao, assistant director horticulture, Amalapuram said that the government is taking all necessary measures to ensure that banana farmers get better prices.

He said that agriculture marketing committees are purchasing the Chakrakeli variety for Rs 200 per bunch and the Karpura variety for Rs60 per bunch. He further said that the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP) is purchasing bananas through DWACRA groups.
