MSU engineering students combat COVID-19 innovatively in slum areas
2020-03-18
Vadodara: An innovation that they had carried out as part of their academics is coming handy for a group of students of M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE), in spreading awareness on coronavirus disease (COVID)-19.With concern for their family members back home, these students took time off from their exam preparations and chipped in to spread awareness regarding COVID-19 in congested slum areas of the city. For this, they are using their indigenously developed robotic vehicle which received recognition at the 9th edition of Vibrant Gujarat Summit.“We had prepared this automatic vehicle as part of our project last year. The idea was to make available an automatic mobile vehicle that can be used to spread awareness on social issues or for advertising purposes. But as concerns over coronavirus are spreading, we thought that there cannot be any better use than spreading awareness among the masses with this vehicle,” said Afzal Sufiya, a final year bachelor of engineering student in electronics stream.Sufiya along with Mahil Dudhat, Yogesh Jadav and Dharmesh Gurjar had developed the vehicle that is fabricated from iron and can be operated through a remote control. Interestingly, all the four are hostel inmates residing in the Polytechnic campus of MSU’s Halls of Residence (hostels).The final year exams for these students are scheduled to begin from April 11. These students have started their awareness drive from Tuesday at slums located near Kamatibaug and Parshuram Bhatta near Jetalpur bridge.“We have incorporated the message on what are the symptoms of this disease, what precautions can people take and the emergency contact numbers,” he said, adding that the idea is to reach out in all those congested areas where the poor, illiterate and semi-literate people mostly reside. “Many of them who have mobile phones are relying on misinformation being spread on social media groups. In other cases, such people do not have any access to mobile phones and are completely clueless on advisory issued by government,” they said.
