2020-05-20
JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to ensure that the institutional quarantine centres are provided with basic personal hygiene items such as sanitary napkin for women as is being done by other state governments.


The division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mohanty and Justice Satish Kumar Sharma gave the direction while hearing a PIL by Shraddha Gautam.

“The quarantined people, including women, are not allowed to go outside the centre and so they cannot purchase sanitary pads on their own. Due to non-availability of sanitary napkins, these women are forced to use damp and dirty cloth which could increase the risk of various types of infections,” the petition said.

The petitioner referred to similar arrangements made by some other state governments. The court said the notification issued by other state governments be considered for the purpose.

“Though it is learnt that the government agencies are taking care of all persons admitted to quarantine centres… in order to ensure personal hygiene of persons, including women, the respondents are directed to check and ensure that necessary articles are timely provided at all quarantine centres within the state,” the court directed.
