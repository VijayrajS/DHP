HYDERABAD: After a large number of people came on to the roads despite lockdown, Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar on Monday warned that criminal cases will be booked against persons if they are seen without any bona fide reason on the streets. The erring person can get up to one-year in jail for violating GO 45, he added.


Police said those who violate GO 45, which detailed the restrictions and conditions to be implemented during the lockdown period, would be booked under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC. At various places, including Cyber Towers, police questioned motorists why they came on to the roads and allowed only bona fide persons, as per the GO, to ply on the roads, while others were told to return home. 

For violating the GO, 244 vehicles were seized by the Cyberabad police and 105 vehicles by Rachakonda police on Monday. Officials said the enforcement would be intensified during daytime on Tuesday.

At checkposts, cops had to stop vehicles and give counselling. DGP M Mahendar Reddy along with Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar visited Charminar and oversaw security arrangement on Monday evening, in view of unconditional lockdown from 7pm on Monday till 6am on Tuesday morning.
