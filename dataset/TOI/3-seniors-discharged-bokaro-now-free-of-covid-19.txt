Bokaro: A 75-year-old man from Telo village in Chandrapura block and two patients above 65 from Sadam village in Gomia block were discharged from Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) after they recovered from Covid-19 on Thursday. Bokaro district, which had reported 10 positive cases last month, is now coronavirus-free with nine patients discharged and one dead. The deceased, who succumbed before he was diagnosed with the virus, was the state’s first Covid-19 casualty.

The three patients were infected by their family members who returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizammuddin in Delhi on March 18. Officials said all three were asymtomatic. 

Bokaro DC Mukesh Kumar praised the efforts of BGH doctors and said, “We don’t have any coronavirus patient in Bokaro. However, it is hard to say anything about the future, but we are ready to deal promptly, if any new cases are detected.”

A BGH doctor treating the patients said, “Apart from strictly monitoring their health, we ensured that the three elderly patients get timely healthy diet and provided vitamin capsules. We also administered antibiotics to them and were released on Thursday after they were cured.”

BGH medical director Dr A K Singh said the recovery of nine patients, including the three elderly persons and an 8-year-old girl, was a big success for his team. He said, “It was possible with strict monitoring of the patients’ health condition and creating a positive environment for them. All patients also cooperated well.”

Civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said the war against the pandemic is still not over for them. “There are about 20,000 migrant workers, students and others who arrived or on their way back to Bokaro and we have intensified sampling tests,” he said. Meanwhile, one patient from Simdega was also declared cured on Thursday.
