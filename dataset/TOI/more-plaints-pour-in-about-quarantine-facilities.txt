Aurangabad: Two videos shot by people staying at quarantine facilities of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation allegedly show the poor arrangements of accommodation and transport for the suspected Covid-19 patients. Though the AMC officials have said that the allegations are baseless, changes have been made as per the directives from the municipal corporation 

A man quarantined at Padampura Emergency Operations Centre shot a video where he alleges that after one of his neighbours had tested positive for coronavirus, the AMC teams shortlisted the close contacts and took them to the quarantine facility crammed in an ambulance. The man in the video alleged that he had no contact with the Covid-19 patient but because he was transported in the ambulance, he tested positive later. He also said that there is no water available at the Padampura quarantine facility.

In another set of video, which was shot by a person quarantined at Qile Ark quarantine facility, allegedly shows lack of sanitation in the toilets and five to six mattresses laid on beds and on the floor in a hostel room. The person also said the on-duty staff does not clean the room.

Talking about the Padampura quarantine facility, AMC city engineer Sakharam Panzade said that it has proper water supply. He said that the people were brought to the quarantine facility in a crowded ambulance but that cannot be the reason for the man testing positive as it takes at least five to six days for the infection to manifest.

 Responding to the allegations made by a quarantined person from Qile Ark facility, Panzade said, “I have asked about the allegations to the staff and they said that people should use toilets responsibly and flush properly.”

Meanwhile, the municipal body’s teams have been directed not to bring suspected cases to a quarantine facility. Instead, their throat swab samples will be collected at their residence.
