MADURAI: With the number of COVID-19 cases going up in the country, health department officials in Madurai under deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr P Priya Raj held preparatory meetings at the district collectorate and at the international airport on Thursday. 


District collector Dr T G Vinay took part in the meeting at the collectorate. “The focus of the discussions was on preventive measures and creating awareness about spread of COVID-19 by spreading good hygiene practices. We are also urging private hospitals to alert us at the earliest in case of suspicions of the disease,” said Dr Priya Raj. About 25 people are currently being monitored in the district for COVID-19. However, so far none of them are symptomatic. The health officials later held a meeting with Madurai airport director V V Rao. Universal screening of all international passengers is being carried out at the airport while masks and hand sanitizers are also being used by officials as a precautionary measure, noted the director. Alert messages are being displayed prominently on banners and boards inside the airport. Between January 28 and March 5, a total of 15,432 passengers were screened at the airport for the disease, said health officials.

Meanwhile, officials continue to create awareness among school students about cough hygiene and hand hygiene to prevent spread of infections. Similar preparedness meetings with the district collectors were held by the health department in Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram too. “We have had to focus on dispelling rumours about COVID-19 and creating more awareness about preventive steps,“said Dr P Kumaragurubaran, deputy director of health Services, Ramanathapuram.
