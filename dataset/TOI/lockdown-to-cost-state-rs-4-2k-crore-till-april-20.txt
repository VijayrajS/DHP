Lockdown to cost state Rs 4.2K crore till April 20
2020-04-18
Bhopal: In complete lockdown till April 20, Madhya Pradesh will lose more than Rs 4,200 crore in revenue. That is, if the state’s revenue earnings are calculated at par with what it had earned in previous financial years, — the revenue targets are not increased. 

Normally, revenue targets are increased by 10-20% every year. 

Sources from the government say that if the lockdown is further increased to May 20, then the losses will increase to more than Rs 8,170 crore. 

And in the event of the lockdown being increased till June 20, the losses will further rise to Rs 12,195 crore. And these losses are apart from the losses incurred by the transport department. 

As transport department is a major source of income, if its figures are also included, then the lockdown till April 20 has already cost more than Rs 5,000 crore to the cash-strapped government. Another major source of the revenue for the government is SGST— collected from sales of consumer and other goods. 

As per budget estimates, around Rs 24,200 crore will be received in revenue in this financial year from SGST, but as there is lockdown till April 20, only Rs 21,700 crore will received, leading to a loss of Rs 2,500 crore. Similarly, in other segments like tax on petroleum products, excise and stamp and registry, the state government will incurr heavy losses.
