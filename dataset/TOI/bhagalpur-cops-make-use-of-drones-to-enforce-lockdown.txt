BHAGALPUR: Police are using drones to keep an eye on violators of the 21-day nationwide lockdown aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 virus.


The Bhagalpur police claimed that the flying devices controlled by remote or through software-controlled flight plans are being used to monitor large areas, including places of worship, from where reports of lockdown violations are being reported.

According to sources, the police have received information about congregation of people at some places, including at makeshift places for worship, in violation of the lockdown.

“We have started taking the services of drones for strictly enforcing lockdown and ensuring social distancing among people, even during times when people come out for buying essential commodities,” Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti told this newspaper on Wednesday.

The district administration has stepped up the process of identifying people who have returned from foreign countries in the past few weeks. “Around 50 people have been identified who travelled to foreign countries between March 18 and 23,” said Bhagalpur civil surgeon Dr Vijay Kumar Singh on Wednesday.

However, sources in the district administration put the figure at 140.

The vigil apart, the Bhagalpur SSP claimed that the district police are also providing food packets and food grains to the needy and underprivileged families with the help of social organizations. “Food packets and food grains are being distributed at specific points under the respective jurisdiction of various police stations,” Bharti said.
