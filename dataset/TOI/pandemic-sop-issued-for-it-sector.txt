Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has issued standard operating procedure (SOP) for the IT industry to manage the spread of coronavirus, whose outbreak declared pandemic by WHO (A pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations). The decision came in the wake of reports that IT professionals, who frequently fly to international destinations as part of work, are vulnerable. On Wednesday, two IT professionals of Dell and Mindtree in Delhi were found to be Covid-19 positive. Another IT professional in Bangalore too was tested positive recently. 

Though techies in IT parks in the state are not affected so far, an SOP was issued following a high-level meeting convened by IT secretary M Sivasankar at Technopark here on Wednesday.

The meeting, which was attended by IT parks CEO Sasi P M, Kerala Startup mission CEO Saji Gopinath, GTech chairman Alexander Varghese and GTech members, it was decided to identify IT employees who visited Ranni and Kottayam in the last two weeks. The companies were asked to conduct medical inspections and isolate them in case of any symptoms. The companies were asked to provide such employees the option to work from home for two weeks or 15-days leave. 

Companies were asked to provide necessary preventive items such as hand sanitizers for employees. 

The SOP stresses on the need for frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces.tnn
