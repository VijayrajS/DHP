Dr Reddy’s in pact with Gilead for Covid-19 drug Remdesivir
2020-06-14
Hyderabad: Pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has entered into an agreement with US-based Gilead Sciences Inc to manufacture and sell Gilead’s investigational anti-viral drug Remdesivir, which was initially developed for Ebola but has now emerged as a potential treatment for Covid-19.

The non-exclusive licencing agreement will grant Dr Reddy’s the right to register, manufacture and sell Remdesivir in 127 countries, including India, Dr Reddy’s said on Saturday. These 127 countries include under-developed and developing markets but excludes developed markets like US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

The Hyderabad-based drug giant said it will receive technology transfer from Gilead for manufacturing the drug and it would carry out the manufacturing scale up and obtain regulatory approval for marketing the drug in the respective countries.

Along with Dr Reddy’s, Gilead also inked similar agreements with other Indian companies like Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadily and Syngene. A month ago, Gilead had licenced the drug to other companies, including Hyderabad-based Hetero Labs Ltd, Cipla, Jubilant Lifesciences, Mylan, for making and marketing Remdesivir in 127 countries.
