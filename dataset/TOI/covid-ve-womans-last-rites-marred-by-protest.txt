2020-05-22
VIJAYAWADA: Notwithstanding government campaigns and specific guidelines, villagers of Bodigadithota and Vaikunthapuram in Nellore district on Thursday refused to allow the funeral rites of an elderly woman to be held. 

The 80-year-old woman tested positive for Covid and was admitted at Nellore Government General Hospital on May 12. She was later shifted to Narayana General Hospitals on May 13. 

Doctors said that she had comorbities like diabetes and hypertension which caused her condition to deteriorate rapidly. On Wednesday, she passed away. 

However, tension prevailed when locals raised objections while the body was being shifted to Kailasabhoomi for the last rites. They intercepted the ambulance and refused to allow them to conduct the funeral. 

The family members then called the police, who reached the spot and informed their higher authorities. Cops said they are trying to negotiate with the villagers to allow the funeral to be held.

This is not the first time where locals blocked funeral proceedings of a Covid victim in the state. Previously, at least four such cases have been reported.
