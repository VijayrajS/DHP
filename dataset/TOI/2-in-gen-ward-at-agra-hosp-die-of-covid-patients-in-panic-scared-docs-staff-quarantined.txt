AGRA: Doctors, paramedical staff and sanitation workers of Agra’s Government Medical College are in a panic after two patients, who were admitted in general wards, tested positive for Covid-19 after their deaths.


The two patients, a 57-year-old man admitted in ICU for respiratory ailment, and a 13-year-old girl in the paediatric ward, died in the last 72 hours. As news of the reason for their death spread in the hospital, a wave of panic swept through the other wards, terrifying patients and administrators alike.

Over 30 doctors and other staff were soon quarantined by the hospital administration. It is feared that hundreds of staffers, including 150 doctors, 300 junior residents, 150 staff nurses might have had direct or indirect exposure to the victims. 

A senior doctor, on condition of anonymity, told TOI, “If some patients are admitted in the ward and tested positive for Covid-19 later, like these two patients, then the entire staff is at the risk of getting infected as no extra precautions are being taken in the non-Covid wards. Also, the quarantine period for direct contacts should be 14 days, which is not being provided to medicos due to overload of work.” 

Principal of SN Medical College, GK Aneja, said, "The man who was in ICU had been tested for Covid-19 but the first result came negative. The girl, however, was not tested for Covid-19 as she had no travel history or contact with other Covid-19 patients."
