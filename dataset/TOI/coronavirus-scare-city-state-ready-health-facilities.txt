The country has so far not recorded any official CoV case. But on Friday, five people have been quarantined in Maharashtra. Experts say that Gujarat is more vulnerable than other states given the higher number of visitors from China owing to business links. 

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), said the government is following international guidelines to train hospital authorities to handle any possible case. “So far, there has been no recorded case of CoV in India. We have no directive yet to screen visitors with symptoms, but we are on alert and ready with screening facilities at Ahmedabad International airport,” she said.

Some private hospitals, too, have readied for the cases with treatment protocol. Dr Vishavdeep Goyal, COO of a city-based hospital, said that Gujarat’s close trade ties with China makes the state vulnerable. “We have circulated the international advisory to the doctors and staff and also have rooms with negative pressure and quarantine facilities. Any patient showing symptoms of the CoV and having history of recent travels to China and nearby countries would be screened further,” he said.

Dr Gunvant Rathod, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, said that the hospital has created a quarantine facility for any potential case. 

“The staff has been trained in symptoms related to CoV,” he said. Any possible case from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC-run hospitals will be sent to Civil Hospital, said AMC authorities.
