Madurai: ‘World Nurses Day’ was observed at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai district on Tuesday. The hospital staff nurses held a candlelight vigil and took oath in front of the statue of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.

This year was extra special for nurses as it was the 200th birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared 2020 to be the ‘Year of the Nurse’. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, the service and dedication of nurses have been exceptional. Many nurses are volunteering themselves and have not hesitated to come for duty in Covid-19 wards,” said Kaleeswari, Grade I matron, GRH.

For nurses, the job is a way of life. “I’m immensely proud to be a nurse and wanted to be nurse since childhood. All nurses are naturally dedicated and provide motherly care. But, nursing was often considered a thankless job. In the past, many families did not welcome a woman working as a woman. But, times have changed. We are always ready to serve and it feels good to get some kind of recognition,” said Sorubarani G, who has been in service as a nursing staff for 23 years.

On the other hand, members of Tamil Nadu MRB Nurses Empowerment Association organised a protest seeking equal pay for those employed by the government on consolidated pay and submitted a petition to district collector Dr TG Vinay. The nurses alleged that though they did all duties, their pay has been considerably less. The nurses wore black cards on their uniforms which read, “Need pay equal to the work we do. Equal work. Equal pay.”
