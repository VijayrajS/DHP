AHMEDABAD: Gujarat on Tuesday recorded 362 positive cases and 24 deaths in the 24 hours ending 5 pm. The state also saw the discharge of 466 Covid-19 patients. It is the highest single-day number of discharges for the state and second time when where 400-plus patients have been discharged in a day.

With the new cases and deaths, the tally of Gujarat has reached 8,904 whereas the death toll is now 537. As on Tuesday evening, Gujarat is second only to Maharashtra in terms of total deaths and cases in India.

Of the new cases, Ahmedabad acounted for 74% of the cases (267). Surat and Vadodara were second and third with 30 and 27 cases. Of the 24 deaths, 21 were recorded in Ahmedabad while one each were recorded from Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot.

Amid the rise in cases, Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health and family welfare), on Tuesday claimed that the epidemic is ‘under control’ in Gujarat. “The condition in Ahmedabad is stable, Gujarat is stable. The situation is absolutely under control,” she said in her brief.

Ravi said Gujarat’s discharge rate has increased from 6.3% on April 21 to 36.5% on May 12. So far, 3,246 persons have been discharged in Gujarat. After the new discharge guidelines three days ago, Gujarat discharged 1,155 or 35.5% of the total number of discharged patients.

She defended the discharge policy citing national and international studies. Under the new discharge protocol, asymptomatic patients can be discharged after 10 days without RT-PCR tests to ascertain viral load.

“The rules were formed by the high-powered committee with experts such as Niti Aayog member Dr Vinod Paul, DG of ICMR Dr Balram Bhargav, two senior professors from AIIMS and others based on research. The research showed that if there are no symptoms such as fever, after seven days the virus doesn’t grow even when presence is detected,” said Ravi.

Ravi also defended the testing rate of Gujarat, saying that the state is doing adequate tests. Among the four Indian states with highest total Covid-19 cases, Gujarat is carrying out least tests per million people. Against its capacity of 3,200 tests a day, Gujarat on Tuesday carried out 3,066 tests. The state has carried out more than 5,000 tests in a day earlier.

“We are carrying out widespread testing and are also conducting intensive tests in a cyclical manner in different districts of Gujarat. For example, more tests were conducted in Devbhoomi Dwarka, Mehsana and Bharuch in the past 24 hours,” said Ravi. “We have not set any targets for testing.”
