AHMEDABAD: With government efforts raising awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic, eateries have taken a hit as citizens have become reluctant to visit spaces frequented by large numbers of strangers, which have have higher risks of cross-contamination and infection.


With malls and multiplexes temporarily shut down and the government advising people to stay indoors and try to remotely work from home, footfalls at restaurants and eateries across the city dropped by at least 30% over the last 7-10 days. Even the numbers of takeaway orders have declined. Citizens have begun to prefer the relative isolation of their homes and the peace of mind provided by home-cooked food.

“The footfalls have gone down by at least 30%. Even though all restaurants are taking extra precautions and ensuring hygiene measures, customers are clearly avoiding restaurants,” said Rajmohan Modi, a city-based restaurateur.

Many restaurants have amped up hygiene measures, right from encouraging staffers to wash hands more frequently to keeping hand sanitizers on tables and upping sanitation and waste segregation.

“We have kept sanitizers on each table and are taking extra precautions to ensure that our water and food quality is maintained at par with standards. We have also ensured our staff members wear gloves and masks while serving food,” said Dilip Thakkar, partner of a city-based restaurant.

“Against at least 50 orders a day, we are getting 10 for non-vegetarian food,” said Rohit Khanna, co-founder, Food Entrepreneurs’ Association.
