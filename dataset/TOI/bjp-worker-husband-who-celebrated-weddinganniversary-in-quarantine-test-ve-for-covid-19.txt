MEERUT: A BJP worker celebrated her 36th wedding anniversary inside a quarantine centre with her husband and three other family members in Shikarpur town of Bulandshahr. Later, the couple tested positive for Covid-19 and was shifted to an isolation facility.


The family of five, including the couple's son, daughter in-law and two-year-old grand daughter, were earlier quarantined as they had come in contact with a Bulandshahr-based ayurveda doctor who had died in a Delhi hospital. The doctor's test report later confirmed Covid infection.

The woman member who had contested muncipal polls on a BJP ticket in 2017 even boasted her act on social media by posting photographs and stating, "Time and place doesn't matter, every moment is celebration when family is together... celebrating 36th marriage anniversary @ quarantine centre." The photographs also showed feeding each other with sweets as part of celebrations.

The incident took place on Monday, but was posted on social media a day later. Police have filed an FIR against the entire family of four.

On Wednesday, Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh said, "All four adults were found to be not observing social distancing norms and have been booked under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life)."

Notably, the politician's family was in close contact with the 58-year-old ayurveda doctor from Bulandshahr who died in hospital on April 10. The doctor, whose report later found Covid-19 infection, had earlier complained of fever and cold, and was on self-medication till his condition worsened.
