2020-04-27
DEHRADUN: City’s Government Doon Medical College and Hospital (GDMC) is expected to get containers where Covid-19 patients (or suspected cases) can be quarantined.


According to a GDMCH source, two containers are being sent by the Centre to be utilised as quarantine or isolation wards. These containers can also be used to make small Out Patient Department (OPD). The size of the containers is expected to be 40 feet in length and 10 feet in breath. The container is expected to have 6 beds and two separate doors for entry.

However, with already existing 400 beds, specially meant for Covid-19 patients, the hospital staff is unsure of its use.

An official from GDMCH told TOI that these containers should be sent to places where there are no hospitals and adequate quarantine facilities are not available. “We are still mulling where to get the vehicles parked and what use should we put them into. These containers are expected to reach here by Monday,” he added.
