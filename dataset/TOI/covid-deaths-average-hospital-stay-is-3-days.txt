2020-05-05
Ahmedabad: Around 18% of the Covid-19 deaths in Ahmedabad city took place on the day of the patient’s admission, either at Civil Hospital or SVP Hospital. For the 180 deaths analysed, the average stay in hospital was just three days.

Around 22% of the patient died on the day after their admission.

AMC officials said that in only seven of the 180 deaths did the patient stay for 10 or more days in hospital. 

The longest stay in hospital of those who died was 14 days, a 69-year-old male who was admitted on April 3 and died on April 17. The second longest surviving patient was a 69-year-old male admitted on April 17 who died on April 30.

In both cases, the patients had co-morbid conditions. Officials said 19% of deaths occurred on the third day of hospitalization. Thus 60% of the deaths occurred in the first three days of hospitalization.

A senior officer said that around two-thirds of patients who died had co-morbid conditions such as diabetics, asthma, hypertension, tuberculosis, hypothyroidism, liver cirrhosis among others.

Officials said that till May 3, 101 deaths were reported from the AMC Central Zone, comprising Khadia, Jamalpur, Dariapur, Shahpur, Asarwa and Shahibaug areas. The majority, 70, were reported from Jamalpur ward.

The officials said that of the 101 deaths in the Walled City, 24% had died solely of Covid-19.

Of the 180 deaths, 50% were in the 40-60 age group and 25% were in the 60-70 age group. Around 17% of deaths were in of those older than 70, while 10% were younger than 40.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said that evidence from the ground suggests reluctance among people to go to the hospital. In areas such as Jamalpur Danilimda, Behrampura and the Walled City, people were reluctant to give samples and teams were also attacked in places such as Gomtipur. “To find the reasons for this reluctance we met doctors in the area, and learned that one major factor is the long period of hospitalization required. In some cases it has been observed that patients died within hours of hospitalisation. We are now taking measures to change this situation and the mortality rate is also improving,” said Nehra.
