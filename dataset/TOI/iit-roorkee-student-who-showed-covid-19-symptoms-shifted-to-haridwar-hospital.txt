Haridwar: A 26-year-old IIT Roorkee student who had shown symptoms of coronavirus after returning from a trip to Japan, has been shifted to the Covid-19 isolation ward of Mela hospital in Haridwar by the health department on Saturday. His sample has been sent to Delhi. He had earlier been quarantined in his hostel after showing flu-like symptoms. 

Haridwar CMO Saroj Naithani told TOI, “A 26-year-old student of IIT Roorkee was observed by our team and quarantined from March 3 when he returned from Japan. He has cough-like symptoms but fortunately, he has no fever and his condition is stable. He has now been shifted to Mela hospital, where an isolation ward with 50 beds also has been formed.”

Meanwhile, 10 teams have been formed in the district to keep track of foreign tourists visiting Haridwar. The health department is trying to track two groups of 286 Pakistani pilgrims who recently reached Haridwar. Earlier, the department had put 297 persons, including 100 foreign nationals, in quarantine. However, they didn’t show any symptoms. 

The district administration has advised against social and religious gatherings in Haridwar. Akhil Bharitya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) Narendra Giri told TOI, “Although the district administration hasn’t requested us to avoid social and religious events, we have taken steps to curb the disease’s spread.”
