Guntur yet to identify Covid source
2020-04-13
Guntur: The Guntur district administration has intensified its efforts to find out how three people were infected with Covid-19. Two of these people have died. Neither the two victims nor the positive patient were in the list of people who had come into contact with other Covid-19 carriers.

Identifying the source of the infection is important to contain the virus spread. The cable television network technician in Narasaraopet who died due to Covid-19 had no apparent links with any of the Delhi returnees or foreign returnees. With a suspicion that he might have contracted it from one of the cable network customers, officials shifted many of the residents close to his house to quarantine homes and had sent samples for test. The victim was a TB patient for long and his samples for Covid-19 returned positive. The results, however, came after his death and made tracking of his contacts difficult.

A 55-year old patient of Narayanapuram in Dachepalle town of Gurazala constituency died of Covid-19 on Saturday. His samples returned positive after his death. Police, revenue and health wing officials have launched search in every possible contact of the victim to track down the source of the virus.

“Unless we know how he contracted the virus, the chances are more for the spread of the virus,” said a senior official. 

The victim had no travel history not had he met any of the Delhi returnees.
