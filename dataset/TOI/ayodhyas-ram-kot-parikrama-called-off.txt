Coronavirus outbreak: Ayodhya’s annual Ram Kot Parikrama called off
2020-03-21
LUCKNOW: The annual Ram Kot Parikrama and assembly of seers in Ayodhya, scheduled on Navratri eve on March 24, has been cancelled in the wake of coronavirus outbreak. This is the first time that the decade-old parikrama has been cancelled.

Confirming this to TOI, Ayodhya DM Anuj Kumar Jha said the administration has cancelled it to avoid large public gathering during the event. The event witnesses circumambulation of devotees and seers around the Ram Janambhoomi site every year. The Parikrama and the assembly of seers is organized by Vikramaditya Mahotsav Samiti.

BJP’s Ayodhya MLA Ved Prakash Gupta said the event holds immense importance for Ayodhya natives as it connects them directly with Ramjanmabhoomi. “We received the information about cancellation of event on Friday morning,” he said. Ramkot is the main place of worship in Ayodhya, and the site of the ancient citadel of its namesake, standing on elevated ground in the western part of the temple town. It attracts devotees from across the world on Ram Navami — the birthday of Lord Ram.

The parikrama, started a decade ago, is attended by around 1,000 people, including members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. 

VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said the cancellation was the need of the hour. “The congregation of devotees and events are only successful when people are safe,” he said.
