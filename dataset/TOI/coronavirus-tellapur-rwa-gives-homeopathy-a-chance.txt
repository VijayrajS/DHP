Coronavirus: Tellapur RWA gives homeopathy a chance
2020-02-08
HYDERABAD : Tellapur residents are taking to homeopathy to prevent contracting infections in the light of corona virus outbreak. However, health care professionals remain sceptical of its efficacy. 

Tellapur resident welfare association has ordered over 20,000 bottles of Arsenicum album 30 as a ‘preventive measure’. “With the virus spreading across the globe, we thought it’s better to be careful than sorry. Homeopathy helps develop the immune system against this virus,” said Ramana Eshwaragari, president, Tellapur Neighbourhood Association, who added that the bottles were being distributed for free. 

 
 
Among the apartments that have asked for the medicine are Mayfair Villas, Induscrest, Vasudeva Bloomfield Ecstasy, etc. “While I am not sure if this medicine is effective or not, I feel we have an opportunity to create awareness,” said Arvind Reddy, a resident of Mayfair villas. 

Homeopathy practitioners said that there has been a spike in demand for Arsenicum album 30 over the last month. Dr Praveen Kumar, a homeopathy practitioner from Ashok Nagar, said, “Many walk-in patients have asked for the medicine, especially those who are frequent travellers,” adding, “The medicine has been known to prevent swine flu, dengue and has no side effects. One just needs four pills a day for five days.” 

However, allopathic doctors are sceptical about its efficacy. P Avinash, a family physician and paediatrician, said, “There is no scientific basis for this. People must understand that there is no need to panic.” He said people should rather follow the basic principles of hygiene, such as washing one’s hands often and avoiding crowded places.

Echoing the need of better hygiene, Dr Bhavani, consultant microbiologist, Continental Hospitals, said, “One must sneeze into a tissue, which should be discarded. Frequent travellers must be extra cautious and try to restrict travel when possible.”
