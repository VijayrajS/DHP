Coronavirus scare: Crew of 3 ships denied permission to disembark at Paradip port
2020-02-01
Kendrapada: Paradip port authorities have since Monday refused disembarking permission to the crew members of three commercial ships that have sailed through China, Hong Kong and Singapore in the wake of the spread of novel coronavirus. Until now, the deadly disease has killed more than 200 people and infected thousands in China, leading the World Health Organisation to declare a health emergency.

On Friday, one ship was denied permission to allow its crew to disembark in Paradip. The ship is anchored 2 kilometres away from the port area. Dr Prahallad Panda, chief medical officer of Paradip Port Hospital, said, “On Monday and Thursday, crew members of two more ships were prevented from disembarking as the vessels had also anchored in countries hit by coronavirus before reaching Paradip port.” 

Port authorities, though, refused to disclose the details of the ships or where they were coming from and how many crew members were present inside. 

Sources said healthcare members would screen all crew members of the ships to detect if anyone is sick before deciding on whether to let them deboard. It is learnt that the process to screen the crew members could start on Saturday. 

“The measure is being taken to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus that has already reached in 22 countries. Due to that we, too, are on high alert in the port area and have to examine the health of all crew members since they have sailed through the affected countries,” Dr Panda said.

“A special help desk has been set up at Paradip port on Monday to detect if anyone has been affected by coronavirus and to provide information to crew and others about the disease,” he added. An isolation ward has been set up at Paradip Port Hospital to treat any showing symptoms of the disease.
