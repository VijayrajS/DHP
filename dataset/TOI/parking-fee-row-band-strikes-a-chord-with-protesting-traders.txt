Parking fee row: Band strikes a chord with protesting traders
2020-02-12
AGRA: On the 29th day of the indefinite strike, a local band performed in support of the traders protesting against the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) over the issue of parking fee.

The band ‘Katyayani’ staged a performance at the Dharna spot amidst a gathering of traders. Leaders of the Congress and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party participated in the protest. 

Traders have been protesting against the AMC administration for charging parking fee at 38 places in the market since January 14. They claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a one-time parking fee at the time of purchasing the property. 

Vice president of Sanjay Place Market Association Brajendra Baghel said, “AMC has flouted norms as traders of the market have already paid a fee for the parking space at the time of purchasing property. The protest will continue till the fee is rolled back.”
