2020-03-30
NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 23 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, the highest in a single day. No other state or union territory in the country has so far recorded these many cases in one day. The number of total novel coronavirus cases in the national capital has now reached 72, and two patients have died.

The upsurge in number of patients is a worrying sign, officials said. “In the last two days, 32 new cases have been confirmed,” said an official.

Of the 23 new cases, the state health authorities told TOI that 13 have travel history, four persons are contacts of positive cases and the status of six others who are natives of other states is unknown.

The government said 64 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in various public and private hospitals in Delhi as on Sunday. The reports of 369 persons who are suspected cases of Covid-19 are awaited.

“We have started a Covid-19 crisis support and counselling centre at Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences. It is operational from 8 am to 8 pm on all seven days. People can also speak to the doctors via video conferencing facility using Skype,” said a Delhi government official.

It has been seen that many high risk individuals, such as elderly and those suffering from comorbidities, tend to become anxious in a pandemic situation. They need psychological support, say epidemiologists.

The Centre is also running a helpline for counselling in collaboration with the experts from Nimhans.

Meanwhile, surveillance of all possible contacts of persons found positive is being followed aggressively. “We urge people to share their travel information proactively and report symptoms similar to that of Covid-19,” public health specialists in Delhi government said.

Of late, the state government has started testing even people with no travel history or known contact with a Covid-19 positive case to assess whether the disease has spread at the community level.
