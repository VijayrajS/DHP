Monserrate said that the collector has assured them to shift the quarantined people from Panaji. People have been quarantined in Panaji on Friday. “I had gone on behalf of the people of Panaji to request collector to shift them. There is apprehension in the minds of elder people and they are tensed after people have been quarantine around their vicinity,” he said

Monserrate said that the people quarantined were working in factories “We have told collector to hire hotels near their industries and shift them. If the people quarantine were from Panaji then we would have no issues,” he said.
