INDORE: As Indore’s positivity rate goes down, MGM Medical College has started pool testing of samples to detect asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 disease. The technique is stated to provide quick results, reducing workload at laboratories and saving cost by using a single RTPCR test for up to five samplings.

According to MGM dean Dr Jyoti Bindal, they conducted successful trials of pool testing of the samples on June 7 and started the procedure from next day. “By June 11, we have conducted total 4920 samples and of this, around 260 samples have come positive,” the dean said.

Around 1,000 pool testing carried out by MGM to test about 5,000 samples in last three days, the result was found positive in about 70 cases and when tested individual, as many as 260 samples were found positive.

She added that as per ICMR guidelines, the college is testing five samples in a single unit under pool testing method. If the pool tests negative then all individuals are regarded as negative. But if the pool sample is positive, each person in the pool is tested individually to find out, who is affected.

The college has started pool sampling for identification of asymptomatic patients after rate of positive cases has gone down in last around 10 days. As per the protocol, said testing is done in areas, where prevalence of the disease is less than 2% of the population.

According to local health officials, if the infection rate is low, pool testing can significantly expand the testing capacity of the existing laboratory infrastructure. 

With easing lockdown norms from June 1, Indore district administration has increased sample testing to check spread of the disease. 

As per Indore CMHO, the local health department on Thursday collected total 3110 samples and received report in as many as 1982 cases.
