KOLHAPUR: The swab reports of the two deceased Covid-19 suspects came negative on Wednesday, said the district administration officials. 

The two patients were suffering from pneumonia and were admitted in Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Rugnalaya (CPR) and city private hospital on Tuesday, where they succumbed to their ailments. As a precautionary measure, the swab samples of the patients were sent to the NIV, Pune. 

This is the third such incident in the past one week, where the deceased swab sample came in negative.

Meanwhile, the Kolhapur district collector Daulat Desai on Wednesday appealed to the citizens to act as volunteers and keep a close eye on the home quarantine suspects. He said that they should avoid frequent visits to buy essential commodities, to minimise the spread of infection. 

“Considering the current outbreak of the infection in the cities like Mumbai, Pune, and other parts of the country, staying indoors is the only safe option,” said Desai.

He asked citizens to monitor the ones, who have returned from foreign countries or other cities, and remain home quarantined during their stipulated time. “If such individuals roam around the city area and if the infection spreads, it will be difficult to contain. Hence, it is very necessary to keep watch on such citizens.”

Desai said people are finding excuses to buy essential commodities. “Now is the time to restrict your usage. If you manage to restrict yourself, we can contain the spread of the infection,” he added
