Pilgrimsâ€™ progress to quarantine
2020-03-27
Ahmedabad: A family of three from the Narol area of the city was among the last batch of pilgrims to have returned from Saudi Arabia on March 15. They were instructed to home quarantine themselves for 14 days due to the coronavirus threat, but they did not pay heed this advice and went roaming about the city.

The administration received complaints from their neighbours and the authorities picked up the couple three days ago and placed them in a government quarantine facility in Nikol. Their son, who was on a business visit to Surendranagar, was quarantined in the neighbouring district. 

Many families who returned after performing the Umrah at Mecca and Medina, met a similar fate after they refused to quarantine themselves. 

More than a week passed and the situation got serious for others as well, as people as is the custom, went and paid respects and congratulated them on their successful completion of the pilgrimage. Feasts were also part of the programmes.
