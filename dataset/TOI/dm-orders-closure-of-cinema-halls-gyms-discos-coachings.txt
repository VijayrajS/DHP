LUCKNOW: Ramping up preventive measures to curb the spread of novel coronavirus infection as two confirmed cases emerged in the state capital, Lucknow district administration on Sunday ordered closure of all multiplexes, cinema halls, clubs, discos, gyms and swimming pools till March 31.


In another order issued on Sunday, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash has directed all coaching institutes to remain closed till March 22. Shops in malls will, however, remain open.


 
 
The state government has already directed closure of all schools and college till March 22 and advised people to avoid mass gatherings. Subsequently, many events were cancelled in the city. While all teaching activities are suspended in educational institutes, coaching institutes had still been continuing their classes.

DM Abhishek Prakash said, “All the decisions have been taken in public interest under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897. We have also made a control room to tackle any emergency situation apart from helping people. Further, if anyone is found not abiding by the order then action would be taken under Section 188 of IPC (disobedience of government servant) that would amount to imprisonment for one month or Rs 1,000 fine or both.”

He said that teams have been set up under additional district magistrates to conduct checks while people are free to report any non-compliance to the control room.

Lucknow police commissioner, Sujeet Pandey said that 14 teams have been exclusively formed to support medical teams in handling patients suffering from coronavirus symptoms. “Teams will also assist the district administration in carrying out operations to check hoarding of masks and their sale at high rates in market,” he said.
