Sources said though the number of devotees coming to Pushkar and dargah declined on Sunday, there were still hundreds of people coming there. 

The district administration has also launched a 24-hour control room and anyone can provide information about the infection so officials can send a rescue team. 

The district collector also directed shutting down of anganwadis till March 31. He directed anganwadi officials to distribute food to children at their homes.
