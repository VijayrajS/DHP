LUCKNOW: The test report of a 55-year-old woman, who died on Thursday morning at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) due to brain haemorrhage, came out to be positive for novel coronavirus infection on Friday.


She is the third patient in the city to have lost battle with Covid-19 since the outbreak on March 11.

The deceased, Rafia Siddiqui, was a resident of Barood Khana in Golaganj. She was the first Covid-19 patient from the locality. She was buried on Thursday itself according to Covid-19 protocol.

In-charge of trauma centre, KGMU, Dr Santosh Kumar said, “She was gasping for breath due to brain haemorrhage when she was brought to the hospital around 2am. She was taken to the ICU for ventilator support as her oxygen level was below 60% but collapsed before intubation could be done.”

“The patient had comorbid conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes and high blood pressure. It is possible that brain hemorrhage was caused by high blood pressure and by the time attendants brought her to the hospital, blood oxygen dropped and her heart stopped functioning,” he added.

Hailing from a lower-middle-class family, Rafia is survived by her husband and two daughters. Family members told doctors that she was complaining of headache for three days and taking painkillers. They rushed her to hospital when she fell unconscious in the wee hours of Thursday.

Her swab sample for Covid-19 test was taken as a mandatory procedure required for every emergency patient. CMO Dr Narendra Agarwal said, “Swab samples of her family members and contacts have been sent for testing.”
