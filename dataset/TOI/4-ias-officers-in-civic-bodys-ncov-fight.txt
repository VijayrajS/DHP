PUNE: The four IAS officers given the additional responsibility of helping the civic body in containing the coronavirus spread would guide the surveillance teams in conducting contact tracing and field operations, and manage quarantine facilities, data as well as medical supplies.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday said the four IAS officers — sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao, animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh, groundwater survey director Kaustubh Diwegavkar and cooperation commissioner Anil Kawade — had been told to use their expertise for better surveillance. “They will devise a plan and carry out the operations after discussions,” Pawar told TOI on Tuesday.

He said the IAS officers were given the extra charge to help the management of the civic administration, Pune divisional commissioner and the collector in the fight against Covid-19.

Pune municipal commissioner Shekar Gaikwad said Rao, also former Pune municipal commissioner, would be handling contact tracing, house-to-house surveillance and overall field operations. Animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh would oversee the quarantine facilities.

The data management would be handled by groundwater survey director Kaustubh Diwegavkar. Cooperation commissioner Anil Kawade would look after the medical supplies and equipment.

Gaikwad said a detailed order would be issued to facilitate the overall management.

Earlier, a total of 15 IAS officers were roped in to contain the coronavirus spread in Mumbai. Similarly, the state government has asked the district administration to suggest names of bureaucrats posted in Pune, who could join the forces with local initiatives. Accordingly, the district administration identified the four officers.
