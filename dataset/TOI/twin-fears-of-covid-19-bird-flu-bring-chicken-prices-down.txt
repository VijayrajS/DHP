Twin fears of Covid-19, bird flu bring chicken prices down
2020-03-17
Panaji: On the back of twin fears of coronavirus (Covid-19) and avian influenza (bird flu), prices of live chickens in some stores in Panaji market have dropped to Rs 100 per kg. But even this low price is not reason enough to attract buyers, with vendors reporting a nearly 30% drop in sales.

While there is no evidence, yet, that Covid-19 could spread due to chicken consumption, buyers say the suspected cases of bird flu being reported from various parts of Kerala are making them apprehensive to consume poultry.

Siolim-based Rixon John Fernandes said retail rates have dropped to Rs 90 and the current wholesale rate is just Rs 60. “But the fear psychosis has drastically brought down sales. On Sundays, we would usually sell nearly 300 chickens, but on March 15, we sold less than 100 birds,” he said.

At the Al Madina cold storage and the Jai Bhavani chicken store in Panaji, the store managers were seen idling away time while waiting for buyers to make their purchases before they could start their work.

The slow movement of the birds has further dented traders’ budgets as they have to maintain them for a longer time. “We spend Rs 5,000 a day on feed, but with the sales down, managing our budget to maintain the birds is becoming problematic,” one vendor said.

Interestingly, the price of frozen broilers remained largely unchanged. At Royal Foods on Monday, a broiler was priced at Rs 129 per kilo. At Magsons Supercenter, Taleigao, the same was selling at Rs 145 per kg. 

Mutton and beef sales though have remained unaffected. “Our sales are intact. It is well-known that the virus doesn’t spread if meat is cooked well,” said beef vendor Musthtaq Khatib.
