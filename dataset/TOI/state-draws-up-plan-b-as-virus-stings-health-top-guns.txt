Madhya Pradesh draws up Plan-B as coronavirus stings health top guns
2020-04-06
BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh is the only state where a string top bureaucrats, leading the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, are in the grip of the virus.

While seven senior health officials, including two IAS officers, have tested positive in just 48 hours, as many as 14 senior IAS officers spearheading the mission are in quarantine or home isolation. Sources say the administration is putting a plan B in place in case the need arises. The officials either hospitalized with Covid-19 or in quarantine as possibly infected have rich experience in the health sector – one of them is an MD and another principal secretary of health – and the expertise needed to handle such a crisis. Samples of 120 officials had been sent for tests after the first IAS officer tested positive on April 3.

With so many of them confined indoors, the administration has to act fast to ensure the battlelines against Covid-19 don’t falter. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan praised health and police officials, who caught the infection in the line of duty. 

“The government has prepared a second line of action in case any official gets infected,” he said. Sources told TOI that a second line of senior bureaucrats has been drawn up to step into the battleground in case a backup plan needs to be put in operation.
