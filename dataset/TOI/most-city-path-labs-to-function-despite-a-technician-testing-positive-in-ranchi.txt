Ranchi: Although rattled by a lab technician testing positive for Covid-19, majority of Ranchi’s pathological and radiological clinics on Sunday said they will remain functional during the ongoing lockdown to cater to patients. 

“A lab technician testing positive is worrying. But we will remain functional by taking all preventive measures as laid down in the protocol of Covid-19 management,” Dr Judhajit Pal of the Station Road-based Ranchi X Ray Clinic told TOI. “The OPDs are closed in private and government healthcare facilities. As professionals, it is our duty to cater to the patients,” Pal said. 

Likewise, the manager of a prominent private national pathological laboratory chain based in Karamtoli area of the city said: “All our sample collection centres are functional. We are observing social distancing protocols and not allowing any patient in without face masks.” 

Most of Ranchi’s laboratories have pruned their business hours. “There is less footfall of patients these days. So, we are working from 7.30am to 1pm on weekdays. The premises are being disinfected after every one hour,” the owner of a pathological lab in Ranchi’s Bariatu Road said. 

Many labs have shut their shops to comply with the lockdown orders. “Our lab is closed since March 23. Many are calling, but we will resume business after lockdown is lifted altogether,” an owner in Booty Road, said. 

The lab technician, a resident of Kantatoli’s Netaji Nagar, is the city’s first positive patient outside Hindpiri locality. He is also the first health sector professional to get infected with the novel coronavirus in Jharkhand. The district administration has begun contact tracing of the man.
