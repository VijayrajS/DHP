2020-04-14
MEERUT: Born in the midst of coronavirus scare, a baby boy in UP’s Saharanpur was named Sanitizer by his parents. It comes days after a couple in Chhattisgarh named their newborn twins Corona and Covid, while in UP’s Basti district, a child was named Lockdown. The trend of using keywords related to novel coronavirus as names of newborn is picking up in parts of the country.

According to Saharanpur couple, they got the "inspiration" after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to everyone to use hand sanitizers, which has been instrumental in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak. 

"This is my way to contribute to the efforts taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government. Sanitizer is helping us fight coronavirus, so I named my child after it," said Omveer Singh, the delighted father of the newborn. A resident of Vijay Vihar locality in Saharanpur, Omveer has two daughters. He was blessed with the baby boy on Sunday. 

Last week, a newborn in UP’s Basti district was named Lockdown by his parents.

The family said they named him so because they do not want any child to be born under such a difficult condition.

While in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur, twins-- a boy and a girl-- were named Corona and Covid.

According to parents, the twins symbolise triumph over hardships, as they were born during the ongoing nationwide lockdown which has disrupted normal life.
