Ludhiana: 25 students from Kota who entered Ludhiana were screened at the flu corner of the civil hospital on Monday evening. 28 students who belonged to Punjab had been boarded in a bus, of which one of Hoshiarpur and two of Dhanuala were dropped on way back.

Dr Geeta Kataria, senior medical officer, said, “After screening, the students were dropped back by the transportation facilities provided by the administration. All have been recommended home quarantine for 14 days and if any symptoms occur, they were told to report at the flu corner of the civil hospital.”

“Prior to this, we have screened as many as 150 migrant labourers from UP and 56 devotees of Nanded from Maharashtra on Sunday.”

20-year-old Prakash Kumar from Hariya village, Uppla tehsil said, “The institute never arranged any such facility for us as we were not living in any hostel. But later after concerns were raised, they had to arrange meals for us. A few days back, UP government called back their students, following which we also raised the issue with our government and they decided to send a bus.”

Ashish Kumar (20), who is preparing for IIT-JEE since last June at Kota, said, “We were dicey and tense as we were always doubtful on the workers who used to cook for us.We never knew whether they were cooking for us by taking preventive measures. We wanted to go back home desperately as all students from all over India had gone back to their states.”

Alisha Dhir hailing from New Hargobindnagar had joined the institute last year on May 24. She said, “All students had gone to their native places and the remaining started feeling depressed as we were quarantined and now again we have been recommended home quarantine but I am glad that I will be with my family now.”
