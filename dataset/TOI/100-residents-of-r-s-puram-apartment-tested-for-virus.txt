COIMBATORE: A day after a new Covid-19 cluster in R S Puram where four dwellers of an apartment tested positive was discovered, the health department began tracing their contacts. 

Officials collected nasal swabs from 100 people residing there and 30 people who attended a funeral. 

The department is in the process of interacting with the four people to find the places they visited and people they met since March 24, Coimbatore collector K Rajamani told TOI. “We took 800 samples on Monday,” he said.

In a bid to ramp up testing, the department tested 500 people on Sunday and 800 on Monday.

The ESI hospital on Monday received equipment and kits to conduct Covid-19 tests, authorities said. “Using the combined capacity of ESI hospital, Microbiology Lab and CMCH, we can test 500 samples a day,” said Rajamani. “So, in the next four to five days, we will test 2,000 samples, besides the 1,300 people we tested from Sunday,” he said.

With the state government extending the lockdown and Section 144 for another two weeks, the collector said the time will be used to increase testing and to contain the infection spread. “We have adequate beds and ventilators. We have also asked private hospitals to keep separate fever clinics and wards ready for us to use if required. But our focus will be to increase testing and containment of the infection.”
