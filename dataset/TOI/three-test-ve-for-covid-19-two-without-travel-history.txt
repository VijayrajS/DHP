2020-03-25
PUNE: Three individuals, including two critically-ill patients with no history of recent international travel and proximity to close contacts of infected persons, tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) at private hospitals in the city late on Monday evening and Tuesday. This has pushed the Covid-19 case tally to 31 in Pune district.


The two critically patients with no apparent history of foreign travel developed viral pneumonia, following which their throat swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for testing as per the latest testing protocol set by the Union health ministry. Both are currently on ventilator support. 

Another person down with the contagion is a 25-year-old Kothrud resident had returned from London on March 12. He was subsequently quarantined at the Naidu hospital when he developed flu-like symptoms. “One of three patients found positive for Covid-19 is a 51-year-old man with viral pneumonia. He is currently on ventilator support at a private hospital in Erandwane. He has no history of travel abroad. He also did not come in contact with any known patient of Covid-19. We are tracing the link. His contacts are now being tracked and quarantined. We do not think it is a case of community spread,” a civic health official said.

A resident of Wagholi, who also has no apparent history of foreign travel or proximity to known contacts of Covid-19 positive persons, is on ventilator support at a private hospital on Ahmednagar Road in Pune. “He is a 48-year-old man. He tested positive for the contagion on Tuesday morning. His condition is currently critical,” the official said.

In the state, the MMR remains on top of the chart with 58 positive cases, of which 41 are from Mumbai. The rest are from Kalyan, Thane and Navi Mumbai, among other places.

Civic officials in Mumbai said the 65-year-old patient had died on Monday evening within hours of admission at Kasturba Hospital near Saat Rasta. The Dubai-based man had gone to a hospital in Ahmedabad on 15 March with a complaint of back pain and came to Mumbai a few days later. He developed fever, cough and breathing difficulty on March 20 and went to a private medical practitioner. As his condition worsened, he got admitted to Kasturba on Monday in a critical state and passed away the same evening. “He was a patient of uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension,” said Dr Daksha Shah, BMC’s deputy executive health officer. She added that the patient’s ‘positive’ report came after he passed away.

BMC officials confirmed that the patient’s final rites were performed at the Shivaji Park electric crematorium. Maharashtra’s public health minister Rajesh Tope said that of the total number of Covid-19 cases now under treatment (104), two patients are critical.
