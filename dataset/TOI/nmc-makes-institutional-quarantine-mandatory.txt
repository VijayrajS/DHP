Nashik: Alarmed by a spike in Covid-19 cases in the city, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to institutionally quarantine people with even the slightest symptoms. 

Till May 20, the city had only 48 Covid-19 positive cases. However, between May 21 and 28, the city recorded 104 new cases causing alarm bells to ring.
