On PM nudge, Saarc leaders to plan today ways to fight virus
2020-03-15
NEW DELHI: Responding to PM Narendra Modi’s suggestion, leaders of Saarc nations will participate in a video conference on Sunday to chalk out a common strategy for fighting Covid-19 in the region. While Pakistan PM Imran Khan will not take part, he will be represented by an official.


All other heads of government will participate in the conference, which will take place at 4.30pm. Pakistan will be represented by Zafar Mirza, special assistant on health to Khan. 

This will be the first contact at the Saarc leadership level since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. On Islamabad agreeing to the proposal, official sources said India is happy to take Pakistan along for an exercise whose sole purpose is to prevent the deadly virus from affecting the lives of people of the region. They warned that it shouldn’t be seen as opening a door for revival of the Saarc summit process.

The government has already announced though that it will invite Khan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit which will be held in India later this year. “The initiative is important as it underscores the significance of regional cooperation in fighting coronavirus at a time when many countries are thinking of closing their borders,’’ said a source.

“I would like to propose that the leadership of Saarc nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus,” Modi tweeted on Friday. “We could discuss, via video conferencing, ways to keep our citizens healthy. Together, we can set an example to the world, and contribute to a healthier planet,’’ he said.

While all other nations responded positively to the initiative almost immediately, Pakistan reacted late in the night with a tweet from its foreign office spokesperson. “The threat of #COVID-19 requires coordinated efforts at global and regional level. We have communicated that SAPM on Health will be available to participate in the video conference of #SAARC member-countries on the issue,’’ the official tweeted.

Mirza is leading Pakistan’s campaign against the virus. Pakistan has so far reported 28 cases of coronavirus. Its National Security Committee has decided to shut the border with Afghanistan and Iran but has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Kartarpur gurudwara.
