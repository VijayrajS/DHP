NEW DELHI: Prices of most of the essential commodities have remained stable, except in Mumbai where tomato and onion prices have increased by nearly 80% and 18-20% respectively during the lockdown period.


Official data show that across cities there has been marginal increase in prices of edible oil and pulses during this period. The daily prices of 22 essential commodities, which are monitored by the consumer affairs ministry show that there is hardly any change in retail prices of items such as rice, wheat and flour (atta), sugar, milk and some types of pulses.

The data show that price of onion, which was at Rs 39 a kg in Mumbai on March 18, increased to Rs 46 on Friday (April 10). Similarly, the price of tomato has increased from Rs 27 a kg in the country's financial capital to Rs 48 during this period.




In the case of Delhi, tomato prices have increased to Rs 33 a kg from Rs 23 during this period and onion prices have been hovering around Rs 35 a kg. In Chennai, prices of potato and tomato have increased by nearly Rs 5 a kg.

The price details, however, show there is nearly 15-20% increase in prices of popular pulses such as arhar (tur) and chana dal in Delhi. The trend is similar in Mumbai as well. In Kolkata, there is slight increase in price of chana dal.

So far as edible oil is concerned, prices have increased marginally in the case of mustard and soya oil.

“How can there is price spike when the consumption is less and there is no bulk consumption at all as restaurants and hotels are shut. Secondly, there are no social functions or celebration. There is no shortage of food items despite the lockdown,” said a consumer affairs ministry official.
