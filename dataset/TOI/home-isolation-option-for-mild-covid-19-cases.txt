Home isolation option for mild Covid-19 cases
2020-04-29
Nagpur: The latest guidelines issues by Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare on April 27 provide for ‘home isolation’ for very mild or pre-symptomatic Covid-19 cases. Such patients having requisite facility at home will have that option. 

At present, all suspected (awaiting test results) and confirmed Covid-19 cases are being isolated and managed in a hospital setting with the intent to break the chain of transmission. Because of this, many asymptomatic patients with requisite facilities at home also have to stay hospitalized.

Noted city pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnkar’s petition in Supreme court also had a prayer to stop admitting such mild Covid-19 cases and keep them isolated at home instead.

While such patients will now get an option of home isolation, they will have to follow certain rules and also have to submit a legal undertaking for this.

“The patient needs to be in constant touch with his treating doctor and district surveillance officer. In case the patient suffers difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to arise, or develops bluish discolorations of lips, he will be immediately hospitalized,” said a senior officer from health department. 

This news is important for small towns like Yavatmal and Buldhana where cases are increasing and the isolation facilities are limited. In Nagpur too, more than 50 patients are admitted in two government hospitals. Over 70% of these are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. They can go for home isolation now.

Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, treasurer of World Medical Association, said the decision would reduce load on health facilities. “World mortality of Covid-19 is 6.90 % and that of Asia is 5.7%. Mortality in India is 0.7 deaths per million population. Asian countries are behaving differently in terms of mortality and India has among the lowest mortality rates. Such changes in protocol are a must with changing times,” said Dr Wankhedkar.
