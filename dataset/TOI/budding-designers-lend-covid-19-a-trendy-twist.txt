COIMBATORE: After designing saris and wearable art to spread awareness on coronavirus and the Covid-19 pandemic, students of the Nift-Tea College of Knitwear Fashion in Tirupur have come up with a ‘corona positive attire’.


The attire, made of denim, carries images and messages to create a positive attitude towards Covid-19. It was designed and produced by Nageshwaran and Deepika, who also did a photo shoot wearing it.

Boopathy Vijay, assistant professor and coordinator of the project, said the students have done value addition using fabric paints, applique work and patchwork. “As printing units were closed due to the lockdown, the students did all the work. We included ideas such social distancing, staying at home, wearing masks and conducting blood tests. As the lockdown is being relaxed and districts are slowly moving from orange zone to green zone, we have depicted a positive approach,” he said.

Though it is not a fashion attire, it is the trend of the time and there could be a demand for corona-themed attire in the future, Vijay added.
