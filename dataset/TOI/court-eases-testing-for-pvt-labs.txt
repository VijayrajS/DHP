2020-06-01
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has directed the state government to grant approval within 24 hours to private laboratories to conduct Covid-19 test on a person, who is advised by a doctor.

The HC has also said that private laboratories and hospitals are not required to seek government nod to perform the test on patient requiring surgery, but the government authority is required to be intimated only. 

The Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) had approached the HC citing various difficulties. Its advocate Mitul Shelat had argued that in many cases permission for Covid test took many days. It was detrimental for the health of patients as well as medical staff. The high court has given a deadline of 24 hours to take decision on request from private laboratory, if a patient is referred by a physician. 

The HC has posed various queries to the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and state government for restrictive Covid testing policy of not allowing testing on asymptomatic persons. it also questioned whether a person can take the test in private lab to eliminate his doubts. It has sought replies by June 19.
