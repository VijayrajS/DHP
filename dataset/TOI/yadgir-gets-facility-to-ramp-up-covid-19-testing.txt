Yadgir gets facility to ramp up Covid-19 testing
2020-05-18
Hubballi: Yadgir district, which has reported five Covid-19 cases as on Saturday evening, is yet to send 734 test reports. 

To scale up the testing of suspected cases, TrueNat testing facility has been set up at the government-run laboratory in the old building of the district hospital.

TrueNat will reduce the burden on the virology lab at Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) here. Due to the scarcity of testing kits and the flooding of suspected patients, GIMS was finding it difficult to carry out large number of testings. “TrueNat is a preliminary test conducted before RT-PCR test,” said officials of the district health and family welfare department.

TrueNat lab will deliver reports of suspected patients in 60 to 90 minutes. The samples of those testing positive will be sent for RT-PCR tests, said DC Kurma Rao.

Additional deputy commissioner Prakash G Rajput said 6,112 people are under institutional quarantine. The district has 85 institutional quarantine facilities.
