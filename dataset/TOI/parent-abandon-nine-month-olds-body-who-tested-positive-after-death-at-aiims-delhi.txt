RAMPUR: The parents of a nine-month-old boy who died due to brain tumour at AIIMS-Delhi returned to Rampur leaving his body behind after the child turned out to be Covid-19 positive. 

“The samples of the baby for novel coronavirus tests were collected a few days before he died (May 29) due to brain tumour. As the report confirmed him positive after the death, his parents made a written submission before the AIIMS authorities, stating that they didn’t want the body of their son, following which officials cremated the body,” confirmed Rampur chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Subodh Sharma. 

Meanwhile, the AIIMS authorities informed the Rampur administration about the matter and the boy’s parents were traced to Bhainsori Shareef village under Milak thesil and quarantined along with doctors and staff of a Rampur-based nursing home where the child was undergoing treatment before leaving for Delhi.

Speaking with TOI, Rampur district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said, “AIIMS officials informed me over the phone that a nine-month-old boy from Rampur district died at the hospital due to brain tumour before he could be operated upon. The parents, however, returned to Rampur leaving behind the body of their son as the report confirmed him Covid positive. Before returning to Rampur, they had made a written submission before the AIIMS authorities that they did not want their son’s body. Later, the parents were traced by the Milak SDM and quarantined.”

“I ordered the sealing of the city-based nursing home where the baby was being treated. Doctors and other staff members of the nursing home have been quarantined and their samples were collected for Covid test,” added the DM.

The CMO, meanwhile, said, “The boy’s parents told us they tested negative for Covid at AIIMS, but we have collected their samples and quarantined them.”
