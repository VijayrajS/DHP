Agra: The state Government has provided a new machine to AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC) for testing samples of Covid-19. 

According to AMU administration, more than 200 patients can be tested for COVID-19 daily with the installation of another RT-PCR testing machine in the hospital. The machine worth Rs 15 lakh will enable JNMCH to speed up the testing, officials said. 

AMU VC prof Tariq Mansoor thanked the state government and said that it would go a long way to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Principal of JNMCH Prof Shahid Siddiqui said, “More than 3,000 free tests of COVID-19 samples have been conducted so far at the institute and the new machine will surely help in speeding up the testing process.”
