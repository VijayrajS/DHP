LUCKNOW: Four-year-old Vaibhavi Chaturvedi, who has been collecting money for her favourite 'Barbie' doll, broke her piggy bank on Sunday not to buy the doll, but to donate her savings to 'PM CARES Fund' created to fight Covid-19. 


She was motivated by her sister Vaishnavi (7) who recited her a story of how her magical 'coins' can save people from a monster named 'Corona'. "I heard my elder daughter motivating her friends and sister to contribute to the fund. I was amazed at her thought and compassion," said her father Rajnish Chaturvedi, principal scientist at Indian Institute of Toxicology Research.

Ten more children, too, joined hands to pool money to contribute Rs 24,698 to the PM fund. Parents of all these 12 children are scientists, working in four CSIR laboratories - Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, National Botanical Research Institute, Central Drugs Research Institute and Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants.

Brother-sister duo Shivang and Khushi Srivastava also gave away all their savings. "We want to donate money for corona warriors. We all should come forward to donate for the cause," said Khushi (14). Kavya Dwivedi, a nursery student, and Atharva Singh of class 2 donated money so that everyone can wash hands with soap. Manashvi Mohanti, Cherasya A Nannaware, Aaradhya, Kavya, Sriyali and Anika, donated for masks, sanitizers and food for the needy.
