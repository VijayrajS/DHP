2020-05-07
Nainital: As migrants workers stranded across the country start coming back to their homes in Nainital, the district administration has announced that it will paste quarantine slips on the walls of their house and they will be sent to mandatory quarantine for two weeks. The administration further said that the health department will maintain a strict vigil on them and their neighbours have been asked to inform the police and control room if the workers violate the quarantine orders.

“The City Response Teams (CRT) and Village Response Teams (VRT) have been tasked with maintaining a strict vigil on all those who come from outside the district, especially from the red zone areas. These teams will also interact with the neighbours of these workers and gram pradhans of their respective villages as they have also been asked to inform the police and the control room if anyone violates the quarantine rules,” said Naintial district magistrate (DM) Savin Bansal in a press statement. 

The administration has also said that if people violate the quarantine rules, they will be shifted from their homes and taken to institutional quarantine. “No person coming from outside the state will enter the district without proper health screening. We have also said that an FIR will be filed against those who do not follow these norms,” DM Bansal added.

Notably, hundreds of people have returned to Nainital in the past two days. While the administration is yet to compile a data on the movement of the people, the CRT and VRTs have been directed to formulate a comprehensive list of the people who have come to the district in the past few days. “Data will be compiled and shared with all the relevant authorities so that a proper strategy can be formulated to check the spread of coronavirus as the migration of people has increased the probability of its spread,” the administration said.
