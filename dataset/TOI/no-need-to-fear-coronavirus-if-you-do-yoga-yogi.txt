No need to fear coronavirus if you do yoga: Yogi

Rishikesh: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that deadly diseases like coronavirus can be eliminated by regularly practising yoga. 

Inaugurating the week-long International Yog Festival in Rishikesh, Yogi said that one who remains both mentally and physically fit through yoga need not fear diseases like coronavirus. “The Indian tradition needs to be understood more deeply as it has tremendous things to offer through yoga. The world is waging a war against mental and physical illnesses. If these are cured, then no one will suffer from blood pressure, heart attack, kidney failure, liver failure or even coronavirus for that matter,” he added.

The UP CM claimed that Japanese encephalitis has gone down by 60% and mortality due to it dipped by 90% in the last two years. He said, “For the past 40 years, I have noticed that around 1,500 children of ages 1 to 15 die during the monsoon season due to encephalitis. Through my fight against the disease in Gorakhpur and eastern UP for the past 25 years, I have come to the conclusion that prevention is the only cure in such cases.” He added that the central government’s ‘Swachh Bharat’ mission has helped people get easy access to clean drinking water thereby helping in controlling the disease. 

Elaborating on the health benefits of yoga, Yogi said, “The very first training given to space travellers is certain yogic kriyas along with pranayama to stay fit. This is a well-kept secret.”
