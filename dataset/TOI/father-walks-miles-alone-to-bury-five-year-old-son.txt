2020-03-29
TIRUPATI: In a heartbreaking incident, a father had to carry his dead son in his arms and bury him all alone at Gorantala in Anantapur district amidst a nationwide lockdown.


The father, identified as Manchala Manohar, works at a scrap shop near the RTC Bus Stand at Gorantala town in Anantapur district. Manohar and his wife Ramanamma have three children. 

Nearly 10 days ago, Manohar’s youngest son, five-year-old Deva began suffering from a throat infection. He fell ill and had to be admitted to a local hospital in Gorantla. But his illness aggravated. Subsequently, he was shifted to a government hospital in Hindupur.

On Tuesday, after the child’s condition deteriorated further, doctors at the hospital advised Manohar to take his child to a better hospital in Bengaluru or Kurnool. But Manohar neither had cash in his hand nor the wherewithal to travel.

On Wednesday, the five-year-old bled through his nose and mouth and finally succumbed. Manohar spent all the money he had to take his son’s body to Gorantla.

On Friday morning, Manohar carried his beloved son’s corpse in his arms all alone and walked all the way to the shore of the Chitravati River where he buried his son and performed the last rites.
