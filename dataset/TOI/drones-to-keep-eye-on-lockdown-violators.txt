2020-03-28
Vadodara: If you thought that gathering in garden of your apartment instead of venturing out on the roads will save you from police action during the lockdown, then you may be in for wrong. 

Police ave started keeping an eye on different areas through drones fitted with high-definition cameras. Police will monitor citizens roaming in narrow lanes or common plots in residential colonies and book the offenders. 

“Social distancing is a must. But many citizens are not still not taking it seriously. We learnt that residents of apartments hang out in their common plot and in the old city people roam around in the lanes,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). 

Many citizens also come out on the roads in groups under the pretext of buying vegetables. “We will capture vehicle number through drone cameras and track down such persons. The drones will take photos of people moving around in common plots of their apartments and FIRs will be registered against all such persons,” Jadeja told TOI. 

On Friday, the cops flew drones in Alkapuri and Karelibaug. 

Police has stepped up action against the citizens by detaining over 351 vehicles from different areas. Vehicles of those who were out on the roads without any plausible reason were detained and 19 persons were booked for flouting section 188. 

“Almost every main road in the city has been barricaded and we are intercepting every commuter to ascertain if they are out for genuine reasons,” said a police official. 

Some citizens, however, are complaining that the cops are not allowing them to move despite giving genuine reasons.
