HYDERABAD: In a marked shift from the last week’s fury, Telangana’s Covid-19 graph took a big dip on Saturday. Only seven new positive cases were reported. With this, the total number of cases in the state reached 990, inching towards the 1,000 mark. It stood at 983 on Friday. The death tally remained at 25 with no deaths in the last 24 hours.

While 16 persons were discharged on Saturday, 658 persons continue to undergo treatment in various hospitals. 

Officials said the number of cases on Saturday was the lowest recorded in the last one week.

In a health bulletin, officials said GHMC accounted for six new cases, while the other case was reported in Warangal Urban district with a 13-year-old boy testing positive. The boy, who belongs to Erravelli thanda in Velair mandal, has since been shifted to the nodal Gandhi Hospital for treatment. Warangal DM&HO K Lalitha Devi said the boy contracted the virus after he came in contact with a positive case in Purigutta in the district.

Officials immediately made the entire Erravelli village as a containment zone. A house-to-house survey would be taken up on Sunday to spot any other positive cases.

On April 17, 66 new cases were reported and 13 on Friday. Health officials said the dip in numbers was an indication of decline in coronavirus positive cases. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said thanks to strict implementation of lockdown guidelines and containment zones, the state would see a drop in the number of Covid-19 cases by the month-end.

While Greater Hyderabad continues to lead the charts with 519 positive cases, Suryapet remained second with 83 cases. Nizamabad has 58 cases and Jogulamba-Gadwal has 48 cases. Of those 25 who had succumbed to the virus, 18 belonged to Hyderabad, two each were reported from Medchal and Rangareddy districts and one each from Gadwal, Narayanpet and Vikarabad districts.
