Bareilly: Two Sambhal residents, who had attended the Tablighi Jamat meet in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month, were traced and isolated on Wednesday. 

District magistrate Avinash Krishan Singh said they had launched a manhunt to find the duo, following the government’s instructions. Their samples have been sent for Covid-19 test.

According to Sambhal chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Anitha Singh, the two youths, one of them is 22-year-old while the other is 23, are residents of Panju Sarai in Sambhal city and had gone to attend Nizamuddin ‘markaj’ in January and stayed there till March-end. 

“The youths, both unmarried, stated that they stayed in Nizamuddin along with foreigners and also visited several mosques in Delhi. One of them had visited Prayagraj before coming to Sambhal. In Delhi, they participated in a three-day jamat and returned here on March 28,” said the CMO.

The doctor said one of them was suffering from fever and they had sent their samples for the Covid-19 test. “The test reports will come by Thursday evening, and if they are tested positive, we will then quarantine their family members, who are undergoing self-isolation,” added the CMO.
