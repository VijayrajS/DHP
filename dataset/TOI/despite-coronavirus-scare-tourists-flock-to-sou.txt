Despite coronavirus scare, tourists flock to SoU
2020-03-16
Vadodara: The coronavirus pandemic and advisories to avoid public places has not deterred tourists from visiting the Statue of Unity (SoU)

In last one week, nearly 40,000 tourists have walked in at SoU and enjoyed the other facilities and parks around. “There isn’t much impact of coronavirus scare on tourist inflow. The number of foreign visitors may have gone down a little, but overall the walk-ins are still good,” said MR Kothari, Narmada district collector. 

The SoU management, though, isn’t taking any chances. Visitors are being screened at the entry and every suspicious case is being reported.
