Covid-19: Doctors ask Patnaites to take extra precautions
2020-04-28
PATNA: A drop in temperature and rise in humidity along with a few spells of showers during the last couple of days have led to a surge in cases of viral infections among Patnaites. Health experts caution that people with cold, cough, asthma, flu and allergies are at a higher risk of Covid-19 infection.

Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Rajeev Anand told this newspaper on Monday, “As of now, there is no evidence that a change in weather plays any role in spreading coronavirus. However, it survives for a longer time in cold and humid conditions.”

He added, “A plunge in temperature has made people more vulnerable, especially those with a weaker immunity.”

Urging Patnaites to “take extra precautions when the weather is cold”, physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi pointed out, “Temperature variations have activated different types of viruses and led to a rise in various health ailments. The tissues of people with flu, cold, cough and influenza often get inflamed, making them more susceptible to the Covid-19 infection.”

Meanwhile, weather experts have claimed that the prevailing system will prevail till Wednesday. 

“The prevailing weather system, which involves thunderstorm, lightning or even hailstorm during the peak summer season, is termed as Nor’Wester or ‘Kalbaishakhi’ and is expected to prevail over eastern parts of the state till April 29,” an official at the Patna Meteorological Centre said.
