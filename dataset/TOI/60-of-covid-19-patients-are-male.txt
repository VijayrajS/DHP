Indore: Every three out of five persons infected with Covid-19 infection is male in the city, according to data from the health department.

Indore reported 2837 positive cases and 103 deaths till May 18 evening. Of those, over 1700 infected patients are male. Dr Anil Singh, epidemiologist of district health department said, “Over 60% of the infected ones are male in city.”

The trend is more or less same in other parts of the country as well as across the globe. Experts attribute the reason as more exposure of males with other persons as compared to females in society. Dr Ravi Dosi, HoD respiratory department SAIMS said, “In society like ours, males have more exposure of the outside world as compared to females. This might be a reason.”

Also, the comorbidities like diabetes, obesity is more in elderly males than females. Such co-morbidities increase chances of severity in infection and ultimately leading to more fatality in elderly males than females, said Dosi.

Dr Salil Bhargava, HoD respiratory department MGM said, “This are no scientific evidence to conclude that natural immunity in females are more than males so they are less affected with this virus infection.” Such study should begin to know the exact causes, said Bhargava.

He added, “Males are more into drinking and smoking, which increases chances of severity in infection and being caught with infection.”
