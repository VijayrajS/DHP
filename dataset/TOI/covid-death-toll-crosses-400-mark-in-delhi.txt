2020-05-31
NEW DELHI: The death toll due to Covid-19 in Delhi crossed the 400-mark on Saturday. It reached 416 with 18 more people being confirmed dead due to the disease. Delhi now has the highest number of fatalities due to Covid-19 in the country after Maharashtra (2,197) and Gujarat (1,007).


Delhi’s Covid-19 tally has reached 18,549. Only Maharashtra (65,168) and Tamil Nadu (21,184) have more cases than the national capital.

 

State health officials said the death toll had risen exponentially over the past month, from 61 deaths on May 1 to 416 on May 30. “This is because many deaths that happened in April have also been added to the list of fatalities. The hospitals hadn’t been sending the death summaries which led to the delay,” said an official.

He, however, added that high number of fatalities and new cases were a cause of worry given that lockdown restrictions were set to be eased further beginning June 1.

Delhi witnessed more than 1,000 new cases for the first time on May 28 and over the last two days, the daily count has increased further to set up newer records. On May 29, the city recorded 1,106 new cases and on May 30, the daily count rose further to 1,163—the highest so far for a single day.

“Though lockdown restrictions are set to be eased because that is needed too, people shouldn’t become complacent at all. The disease spread is likely to get worse and, therefore, it is going to be even more important to follow social distancing norms and avoid going out,” said a health official.

Because most Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic, the state government is focusing a lot on home isolation.

However, more hospitals like Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) are being designated fully for Covid-19 to tackle any potential crisis where a larger number of patients requires admission for management of severe illness caused by the viral infection.

At present, the number of active cases of Covid-19 in the state is 10,058. Of this, 2,395 are admitted in various hospitals. Total 246 patients are requiring ICU or ventilator support. Around 5,139 (51%) are under home isolation while the rest who have mild illness have been kept in various Covid care centres and Covid health centres.

Meanwhile, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital has put up extra containers where dead bodies can be kept in case there are more bodies than their mortuary capacity. Recently, there was a lot of problems in dead body management at hospitals even as cremations were delayed.
