GAYA: Gaya district administration has extended the quarantine period of people susceptible to Covid-19 by another two weeks. The earlier quarantine order was issued for two weeks.


Of the total quarantined people, 11,250 are under home quarantine and 1,328 others are lodged in government-run quarantine centres in 24 blocks of the district. Home- quarantined people are completely forbidden from stepping out of their homes.

Altogether five Covid-19 positive cases have so far been recorded in the district. Of them, three have recovered.

Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said those quarantined either have international or domestic travel history. “It is mandatory for people with international travel history to undergo Covid-19 test. Those who have come from other parts of the country are asked to remain at home and approach the civil surgeon in case of any Covid symptom,” the DM said.

Earlier, the district administration had relocated the vegetable market of the town to Gandhi Maidan and Azad Park to avoid gatherings. “In the absence of a master plan, the town has witnessed congestion in select localities,” Congress functionary Vijay Kumar Mithu said.
