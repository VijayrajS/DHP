Differently abled to get passes for travel during lockdown
2020-04-23
Visakhapatnam: The state government has planned to issue passes to differently-abled persons in the state so that they can travel during the lockdown. This comes in the wake of a number of NGOs and activists working for the welfare of the differently abled demanding that steps be taken to ensure their safety. 

According to deputy director of department of disabled welfare M A Kumar Raja, certain measures have been initiated by the government. “ We have issued instructions to officials concerned to issue passes for differently-abled persons so that they can access medical care and markets during the lockdown,” Kumar Raj said, adding that the government is also providing audio and video clips to people with visual and auditory impairments so that they can follow the quarantine instructions.

However, when asked if the directive concerning the issuance of passes was given in writing, the deputy director said that it has been given during a video conference in the first week of April. “ It is an ongoing process,” he added.

Activists, however, claimed that passes are yet to be issued. Dilip Patro of The Ability People and an advisor to the GVMC said, “We are yet to receive such passes. More important, basic provisions such as special platforms for the differently able in rythu bazaars and open markets are yet to be provided.”

When asked about the ramps, the deputy director confirmed that it was yet to be done.
