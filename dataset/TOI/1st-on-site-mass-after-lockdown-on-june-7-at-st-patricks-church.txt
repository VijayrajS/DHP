Kolkata: First on-site mass after lockdown on June 7, at St Patrick’s Church
2020-06-01
KOLKATA: After the lockdown, the city’s first on-site mass will happen on June 7 (Sunday) at St Patrick’s Church, Dum Dum. Though only 10 masked worshippers will be allowed to attend the mass, it will be a full-fledged service to be conducted by archbishop Thomas D Souza of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Ever since the lockdown started, only online masses have been live streamed from the archbishop’s house and the Christian community observed Lent, followed by Good Friday and Easter, virtually. In keeping with the state government’s orders, churches are re-opening post lockdown on Monday when the 35 churches under the Church of North India, Kolkata Diocese (CNI) will also open their doors. They will allow only 10 masked worshippers at a time while a slew of other measures are also being taken following the guidelines of the state government. This is slightly different from the ministry of home affairs’ guidelines allowing religious institutions to start from June 8.

The special mass on the church premises has been organised to install a new parish priest at St Patrick’s Church. Father, S Irudaya Raj, will be anointed as the new priest of the church and he will be blessed by the archbishop, following Catholic church traditions.
