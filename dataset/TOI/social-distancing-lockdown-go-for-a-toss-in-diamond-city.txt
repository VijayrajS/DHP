Social distancing, lockdown go for a toss in Diamond City
2020-03-28
Surat: It seems lockdown order and social distancing to combat COVID-19 have gone for a toss in the city. Apart from movement of vehicles in most parts of the city, residents were seen thronging grocery shops and vegetable markets, discarding the appeal for social distancing made by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) and district administration on Friday.

Residents had thronged the grocery shops, milk counters and medical stores on the entire stretch from Ramnagar to Adajan. People were standing in queues outside the shops without keeping a safe distance. The scene was horrific at Sardar Market at Sahara Darwaja, where large number of people had come to purchase farm fresh vegetables and fruits, without worrying about spread of contagious COVID-19. They had gathered in large numbers at one place rubbing shoulders with each other.

Rajesh Kaladiya, a vegetable wholesaler at Sardar Market, said, “We had closed the gates of the market in the morning and asked customers to enter in small groups. But when the gates were opened, a sea of people entered the market. We couldn’t do much to stop them.”

Kaladiya added, “The market is regularly getting supply of vegetables, but still people are coming to the market to buy vegetables at wholesale rates. Majority of customers are from residential apartments.”

Nilesh Thorat, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), which manages Sardar Market, said, “We immediately asked senior officers of municipal corporation and district collector’s office to visit Sardar Market. A team of officials visited the market and ensured deployment of cops to stop people from gathering at the market from Saturday.”

Dr Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospital), told TOI, “Residents need to understand the seriousness of COVID-19. They have to maintain social distancing when standing at grocery shops, vegetable markets etc.”
