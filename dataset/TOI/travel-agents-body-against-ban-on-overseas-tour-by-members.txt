Covid-19 threat: Travel agents’ body against ban on overseas tour by members
2020-03-17
PUNE: The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), the apex travel association in the country, has said that it cannot 'ban' member tour companies from conducting tours to countries for which the Union government has not released any travel advisory yet. 

As of now, the Centre has advised people to refrain from travelling to countries like China, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Iran . 

However, the government has not issued travel advisory for destinations like London, the UAE, Sri Lanka and the US, among many other countries, yet, a TAAI source said. “Advisories are given as advice but unless countries close entry, we as a travel association or agents cannot stop anyone willing to travel,” the source said.



 

Jyoti Mayal, TAAI national president, told TOI that the association cannot tell agents to stop sending people to countries for which there are no advisories yet. “The Union government has been issuing advisories for various countries that are unsafe to travel after the Covid-19 outbreak. Those countries are the ones we are excluding from tour itineraries. As soon as we receive an advisory from the ministry of tourism, we will tell our members to exclude those destinations from the itineraries,” she said. Another source from TAAI said, “We cannot stop people from travelling to certain destinations. The world cannot come to a stop after the outbreak and we cannot control people’s movement,” the source said.

Sameer Karnani, chairman, TAAI-western region, told TOI, “It is not possible for TAAI to tell agents to stop conducting tours. The moment we say something like this, it means that we are telling the world we are locking down. Nevertheless, we will be in touch with the company in question, tell it to advise travellers to follow safeguards such as sanitisation and stay away from travel companions with colds, among others.”
