The district administration reported 95 people who had arrived from foreign countries. Most of them have been told to observe home-isolation. Two are under surveillance at the CPR Hospital’s quarantine ward.

District collector Daulat Desai said: “The swab samples of the suspected patients have been sent for testing. We are reaching out to more people who have travel history in recent weeks. They are advised to stay at home and follow the quarantine rules during the incubation period. We have set up a panel of 10 doctors to repeatedly check on the health status of people in quarantine.”

In Sangli, 77 persons with travel history are home-quarantined. They have been asked to stay at their home for 14 days. The passive surveillance will be carried out for the next 14 days. If anyone tests positive, s/he will be immediately offered treatment.

Abhijeet Choudhary, the Sangli district collector, said, “We have initiated the survey of the persons with travel history. The health officials have been directed to reach out to them and ensure that they do not leave their homes. The officials have been asked to keep a watch. I have also asked the coronavirus control cell to report the misinformation being spread on social media.”

Desai has directed the health department to keep the quarantine ward operating round-the-clock and get help from the local self-help groups to provide food.
