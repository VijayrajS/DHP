VADODARA: Karelibaug police on Wednesday arrested a BJP worker and seven others for flouting police notification issued to enforce lockdown. BJP ward president Anil Parmar was arrested as he had celebrated his birthday on Tuesday night with his friends and family members outside his house in Tulsiwadi. 


“He said that he wasn’t aware of the celebration and it was a surprise. But Parmar could have refused to attend the gathering. He was seen celebrating his birthday and cutting the cake. We arrested him and seven others on Wednesday,” said police inspector R I Jadeja. The cops learned about the celebration after Parmar’s photos were shared on social media.
