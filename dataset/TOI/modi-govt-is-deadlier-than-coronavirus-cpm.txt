COIMBATORE: State CPM secretary K Balakrishnan on Friday said the BJP-led central government was deadlier than the coronavirus. 


Pointing out that China has been facing a lot of difficulties because of coronavirus, he told the media in the city that “prime minister Narendra Modi-led government is deadlier than coronavirus and that the government has been killing the people of the country.” 

The left parties, he said, would stage nation-wide protests to condemn the Union budget, Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens from February 12 to 18. 

Referring to the search by income tax (I-T) department at the house of actor Vijay, Balakrishnan said, “We are not against the I-T raids. But the way in which it was conducted was wrong. If the I-T department had issued summons, actor Vijay would have appeared before the officials. Actor Vijay's movie had dialogues against the BJP. So, the Union government is conducting the I-T raid at Vijay's house.” 

He also condemned the I-T department for failing to take a neutral stand. “Minister Rajendra Balaji should explain whether he belongs to the AIADMK or the RSS. He is speaking like Hindu outfit members. His hate speech would create problems in the society and stringent action should be taken against him,” the CPM leader said. 

Balakrishnan said the BJP's efforts to gain foothold in Tamil Nadu hasn’t succeeded so far. “So, the BJP has influenced actor Rajinikanth and it has been speaking through the actor.”
