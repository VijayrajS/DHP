Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain... virus cases soar in W Asia
2020-02-25
SEOUL: The new virus took aim at a broadening swath of the globe on Monday, with officials in West Asia and Europe scrambling to limit the spread of an outbreak that showed signs of stabilising at its Chinese epicentre but posed new threats far beyond.


Clusters of the virus continued to emerge, including a possible one in Qom, an Iranian city where the country’s semiofficial ILNA news agency cited a lawmaker in reporting a staggering 50 people had died of Covid-19. Iran’s health ministry rejected that, insisting toll remained at 12. Five neighbouring countries —Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Afghanistan — reported their first cases, with those infected all having links to Iran.

Italy has locked down 50,000 people in 10 towns to contain the first major virus outbreak in Europe, as fears grow of a spread across the continent. On Monday, the number of cases in Italy rose to 219 from at least 152 on Sunday.

Across the world, stock markets and futures dipped on fears of a global slowdown due to the virus spread, with the Dow down more than 800 points. The number of people sickened by the coronavirus topped 79,000 globally.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said using the word “pandemic” did not fit the facts. “We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he said in Geneva.
