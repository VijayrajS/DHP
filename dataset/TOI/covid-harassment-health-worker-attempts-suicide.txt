Covid harassment; health worker attempts suicide
2020-06-01
Kozhikode: A health worker attached to the New Mahe public health centre in Kannur district has tried to commit suicide following alleged mental harassment in the name of Covid-19.

The woman was admitted to the Government Medical College, Pariyaram after attempting suicide by consuming tablets for hypertension in large numbers on Friday night. According to hospital sources, she is recovering.

There were allegations that she violated quarantine norms by visiting a relative who came from Bangalore. BJP and UDF had organized a dharna in front of the PHC demanding that the staff should be sent to quarantine.

But the relatives said that her sister who had come from Bangalore and mother who visited the sister are living at another house and they were not in contact.

A WhatsApp message purportedly from the woman is doing the rounds in the social media in which she named some of her colleagues for raising baseless allegations against her.

Meanwhile, New Mahe police said they have not yet registered a case as they are unable to record the woman's statement as she is in the hospital. "We will record her statement as soon as possible after she is tested negative for Covid-19," said New Mahe sub-inspector Ratheesh.

"We have not yet checked the veracity of the WhatsApp message. Only she can tell whether the details in the message are true or false. We will register a case after recording her statement," he said.

Meanwhile, the New Mahe panchayat has come up supporting the health worker saying that the allegations against her are baseless. The panchayat said that the accusations are politically-motivated
