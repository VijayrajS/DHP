PUNE: Drivers of two buses of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) came to the aid of two pregnant women in distress and took them to hospitals on Monday.
 

At 11:45am, the driver and conductor of a bus, on way from Mhalunge to PMC, came across Shikha Shailesh Kumar who was pregnant and in a lot of pain. They admitted her to a private hospital in Kothrud. 

In the second instance, a PMPML bus crossing Paud Phata was flagged down by a heavily pregnant woman who requested to be dropped at the KEM Hospital. The driver of the bus agreed and dropped her at the hospital.
