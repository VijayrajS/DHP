Covid distancing goes for a toss at ration card centre
2020-05-17
Nagpur: School teachers called for ration card registration drive were shocked to see blatant violation of Covid distancing guidelines by their peers and other officials. Those who reported to the centre located near Cotton Market said all teachers were clamouring near the main desk, and no officials were present to ensure that crowding does not happen. A group of teachers shared photos and videos from the spot. People can be seen standing very close to each other, sometimes even pushing to reach the desk where their duty specifics were available. “We have been hearing continuously from the government that Covid distancing is to be maintained. But nothing like that was happening at this location — which is being managed by the government itself,” said a teacher. Another teacher said that the summer heat and threat of the virus was making it worse for them. “We teachers are always at the forefront for everything. We are sent for census and elections; this ration card duty is the new addition. We are not sure how it will all be done, as teachers supposedly have to visit door-to-door to get the registrations done,” said the teacher. For those already suffering from diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, there is an increased threat from the virus. A teacher said, “I am a diabetic and have medical records for the past decade to prove this. I reached out to the authorities and explained my health situation, but they refused to entertain my application for relief.”Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (Nagpur district) said, “Teachers are always ready to serve the government. All they expect is that basic facilities be made available to them. There should have been somebody present to ensure enough distance is maintained between teachers. We will definitely take this issue up with the authorities.”
