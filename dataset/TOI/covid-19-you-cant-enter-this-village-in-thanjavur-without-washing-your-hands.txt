THANJAVUR: S Rahmathullah, 53, panchayat president of Senthalai Vayal panchayat in Sethubavachathiram union of Thanjavur district, has setup a water tap connection along with sanitizers and soap at the entrance of the village as part of preventive measure for Covid-19. 


He has also fixed a flex board stressing the importance of keeping hands clean and other preventive measures to safeguard them, which has received much appreciation among the public. His aim is to ensure that whoever comes to the village must wash their hands before entering. Around 2,000 families are residing in the village. Out of them, most have the history of visiting abroad, which necessitated for the common hand wash facility, sources said. 

Government is stressing the need to follow various steps to maintain personal hygiene and keep our hands clean. “Being a village, we cannot expect each and every one to follow the advisories. At least 200 to 300 labourers visit our village for construction work on a daily basis. It is unfair to expect that they would follow the instruction. Prevention is better than cure. So, I decided to do this,” Rahmathullah said.

“With the help of the handwashing arrangement, we can clean our hands, legs and face even before entering our streets. This would be helpful for everyone’s hygiene, particularly after the outbreak of coronavirus,” he said.

“I have asked a few of the villagers to keep a check on the movement of people and to make sure that no one enters the village without washing their hands. We have ensured 24-hour water supply. The person posted there will ensure that the required soap and sanitizer is refilled,” he added.
