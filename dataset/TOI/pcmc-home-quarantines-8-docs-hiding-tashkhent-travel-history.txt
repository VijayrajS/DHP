PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body on Saturday home quarantined eight doctors, who returned from Uzbekistan but did not inform the authorities about their travel history.


Confirming the move, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “We home quarantined the doctors soon after getting information about them.”

An official of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said 40 doctors, including the eight residents of Pimpri Chinchwad, had gone to Tashkent in Uzbekistan for a conference. According to initial reports, these doctors did not inform the PCMC authorities about their travel history after returning to the city.

“The government as well as others have appealed to people returning from abroad to inform local authorities and undergo strict home quarantine to prevent the spread of Covid-19. People returning from abroad are screened at airports and information of those returning to our city is given to us,” said Hardikar.

On Friday, a home quarantined person and one of his family members were sent to the isolation ward in New Bhosari Hospital after the former was found going around in a car with his wife and father.

The civic body has made arrangements to start institutional quarantine at Balewadi, where it can accommodate 450 to 500 people coming from abroad. It also has created facilities to start a 100-bed isolation ward at Jijamata Hospital and a 30-bed isolation ward at an eye hospital in Pimpri.

A senior civic official said nobody tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. A total of 613 people has been home quarantined in the Pimpri Chinchwad limits.
