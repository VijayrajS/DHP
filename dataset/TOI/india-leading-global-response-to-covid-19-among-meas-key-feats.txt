NEW DELHI: Leading the global pandemic response of the Indian government is on top of the list of MEA’s achievements in the first year of Modi’s second term, according to official sources. MEA has brought back 40,000 Indian nationals from different parts of the world in 230 flights and naval ships.


In a document to mark the first year of Modi 2.0, the MEA said it had overseen Covid-related medical supplies to over 154 countries. The foreign ministry also counted a Saarc video conference PM Modi held with other South Asian leaders among its top achievements. A year back, Modi kicked off his second term with visits to Maldives and Sri Lanka and Bhutan. He also hosted visits by leaders from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Mauritius.


In the neighbourhood, India inaugurated the 720 MW Mangdechhu hydropower project, the Motihari-Amlekhganj cross border petroleum products pipeline besides assisting in the rebuilding of 45,000 houses.

In a rare collaborative effort, India and Pakistan launched the Kartarpur Corridor in November.

With Bangladesh, Modi and Hasina jointly inaugurated an LPG pipeline, students’ hostel in Dhaka and a professional skill development institute in Khulna. In Sri Lanka, India opened a much needed emergency ambulance service, while in Maldives, India gifted a coast guard ship. The India-US relationship moved apace, with the foreign office considering the “Howdy Modi” and “Namaste Trump” events to be major highlights. Modi’s visit to Russia in September 2019, saw India announce a $1 billion credit line for the development of the Russian Far East.
