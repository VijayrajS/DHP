PALANPUR: It was a risky proposition all the way. She is 30, pregnant with twins, one of which was breech (oblique) and on top of it, she herself is infected with coronavirus. Therefore, doctors at the Vadnagar medical college knew that their task was uphill informed the relatives about the critical situation and sought permission before risking an operation. 

However, that’s all in the past when the mother of two from Malipur village, a containment zone located 5km from Vadnagar, delivered a set of healthy twins — a boy and a girl — on Saturday. The icing on the story is that that all the three of them are safe, said HD Palekar, medical superintendent of the college.

After testing positive for Covid-19, the woman was admitted in the Vadnagar medical college in Mehsana district. Looking at the risks involved with her operation and infection, the doctors were worried about her and the babies’ safety. The relatives knew their chances and relied on the experts. 

“We arranged a separate operation theatre and our medical team carried out the operation that took quite long. Finally, the team was successful in their tough task. The patient is being given treatment in accordance with health ministry guidelines and she too is responding well. Both the babies are healthy, though their Covid tests can be done only after 24 hours of birth and on Monday,” said Palekar.

Palekar further added that the doctors in the hospital added a feather to their cap of achievements by undertaking the first such risky operation probably since its inception.
