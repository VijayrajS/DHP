2020-06-08
New Delhi: Congress on Sunday slammed Delhi government’s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic, blaming it on unpreparedness and poor condition of hospitals, even as it questioned the decision to unlock the capital city when it had the highest positivity rate and lowest recovery rate in the country. It accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of putting the lives of Delhi residents at risk.

AICC spokesman Ajay Maken told a press conference, “Delhi hospitals are in bad shape. Delhi government has taken a premature decision to open restaurants, malls from June 8 before health infrastructure is improved.”

Maken also questioned the idea of reopening the schools and said that parents should not send their children out till a cure for the virus was found.

While pointing out that 72% of beds dedicated for virus infections were lying vacant, Maken asked the state government to respond why were people having to run from pillar to post to find admission in hospitals. He also questioned why were only five of Delhi government’s 38 health institutions accepting corona patients while warning that Delhi will have 50,000 cases by mid-June.

The Congress spokesman also criticised the state government for what he called was not giving the dead a dignified cremation. “Bodies lie in crematoriums for five days and are not cremated because of Covid-19 protocol,” he said, while accusing the government of hiding death figures.
