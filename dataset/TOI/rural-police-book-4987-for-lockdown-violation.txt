2020-05-29
Nashik: A total of 4,987 people have been booked by Nashik rural police under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for violating lockdown in rural areas, including Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC). 

Ever since lockdown was announced by the state government to curb the spread of Covid-19, rural police have been registering cases against the violators.

“It is not that we started booking people from the first day. We first spread awareness about the disease as the situation was new for everyone. After spending enough time on sensitization we started booking people,” Arti Singh, superintendent of police (Nashik rural), said. 

After the lockdown was imposed on March 23, police carried out announcements in the public areas about the precautions need to be taken by everyone.

Public address system (PAS) were attached on drones that were pressed into service for informing people and keeping a watch on the lockdown violators.

Rural police have thus booked the people for not wearing masks, not following physical distancing, crowding at a place and moving out of house without any valid reason.

Beside booking these people, as many as 631 vehicles were also seized by the police from motorists violating the lockdown.
