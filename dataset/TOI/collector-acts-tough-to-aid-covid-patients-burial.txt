THRISSUR: The body of Dinny Chacko from Chalakudy, who died of Covid-19 on Tuesday, was buried at St Sebastian Church, Thachudaparambu, in the district on Wednesday evening, ending uncertainties over his last rites.

The issues were resolved finally after district collector S Shanawaz issued an order under the Disaster Management Act, and other rules relating to the containment of infectious diseases, saying the body will be buried at the St Sebastian Church, which is the local parish of Chacko.

Chalakudy tahasildar E N Raju said the body was buried in a deep pit dug at the Church cemetery, with tight police protection, and in presence of officials from the health and revenue departments as well as the authorities of the Chalakkudy municipality.

The church authorities and some believers had raised objections against the burial of a Covid-19 patient in the church cemetery which was using concrete vaults for burying the body. They had argued that the cemetery was on a marshy land which had experienced two floods in 2018 and 2019, and a digging deep pit in that watery plot would be impossible.

Some residents had given a petition to the tahasildar and they also filed a petition at the munsif court against the burial of the body.

Meanwhile, collector S Shanawaz held talks with Irinjalakkuda Bishop Mar Pauly Kannookkadan and local church officials.

Subsequently, the possibility of burying Chacko’s body at St Mary’s Church, Kuzhikkattussery, which is the parish of his wife, was also explored. The possibility of burying the body at Chalakudy Big Church was also explored. But the authorities of both the churches declined permission for the burial.

Finally, the body was buried at the St Sebastian Church, as per the order of the district collector who is also the district magistrate.
