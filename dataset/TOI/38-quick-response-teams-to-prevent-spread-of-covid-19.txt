2020-03-25
Nagpur: The district administration, in association with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Homeguards Department, has constituted a Quick Response Team (QRT) for each of the 38 wards. The QRTs will be on the ground, assess exact situation prevailing across the city and submit reports daily, which would be beneficial for implementing various measures to control spread of Covid-19.

It is the initiative of divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and collector Ravindra Thakre in association with municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe and CP Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay.

Deputy collector Ravindra Kumbhare told TOI, “QRTs will start their work from Wednesday. Each QRT comprises of five members — employee from revenue department, homeguard, staffers from NMC solid waste management, NMC malaria and filaria department, and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM). They were given necessary training and formats on Tuesday at the collector office as well as NMC,” he said.

QRTs will visit houses of all 744 home quarantines once in a day. ANM will report to concerned doctors in case of any symptoms in home quarantine. Also, those not complying with home quarantine orders will get two warnings, followed by action in the third instance.

QRTs will check whether any grocery or dairy or any other shops where people are coming together does not maintain social distancing. They will inform NMC as well as collector office following which necessary steps will be taken.

QRTs will also check whether any area lacks stock of grocery and other essential commodities. All concerned departments will swing into action if any such area is identified.

QRTs will also identify areas facing other problems like menace of mosquito etc.

QRTs have been also given responsibility to talk to people and identify persons, especially lone senior citizens or females, who are unable to come out and need grocery or any other essential products. QRT will alert about such persons and necessary help will be provided.

Kumbhare said, “QRT is a medium to reach the people as lock down is implemented in entire city. It is a way to ensure people do not come outside for any help. We can come to know problems being faced by the people and resolve it in time through QRTs,” he said.

Probably, the city is the first in the state to launch QRTs.

Kumbhare also said QRTs will be compulsorily in their respective wards during working hours. “All five members of QRTs will have to submit reports to respective departments in the evening,” he said.
