Lockdown: Nearly 1,000 carts to supply veggies, fruits in Bareilly
2020-03-30
BAREILLY: Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to press into service around 1,000 carts across all 80 wards for uninterrupted supply of vegetables and fruits to city residents at their doorsteps. 

According to corporation officials, efforts are on to deploy at least 1,000 vegetable and fruit carts from prominent vegetable markets such as Delapir, Kotwali, Quila, and others for the purpose. The carts will be moving through various localities, ensuring that people buy vegetables and fruits at their doorsteps and don’t go to the market. 

Speaking to TOI, Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “The district administration and the civic body are working jointly to provide residents vegetables and fruits at their doorsteps by pressing around 1,000 carts into service across the city. We are in talks with sellers at markets such as Delapir, Shyamganj, Quila and Kotwali to provide the service until the lockdown is lifted. Several vendors have already started providing service in a few localities.”

“The move is being taken to curb the movement of people outside, as residents are thronging vegetable markets during the morning hours daily. This needs to be controlled, as it defeats the very purpose of the lockdown. Even as the guidelines for social distancing have been issued, many people are not following it, which can be risky,” added Anand.

BMC officials said the service would be available to people from 9 am onwards.

The civic body authorities have been taking several measures to provide residents the required household products at their doorsteps. Nearly 300 big and small grocery stores have been identified by the nagar nigam across the city to deliver groceries at the doorsteps.
