Fighting the virus with film songs
2020-03-13
Kochi: As the state is on high alert over Covid-19, a set of audio jingles using catchy tunes from popular Malayalam film songs that spreads awareness on Covid-19 created by the National Health Mission (NHM) has gone viral on social media.

These jingles, which starts off with catchy numbers like ‘Thottu thottu nokkaamo thottaavaadee ninne’ and ‘thotturummi irikkan kothiyaayi’, were created by the behavioural change communication (BCC) wing of NHM with help from private FM stations. The messaging is about the need for social isolation by keeping a distance, the need to desist from touching and wearing of masks. Towards the end of the messages, which are less than 25 seconds, 1056, the helpline number of Direct Intervention System for Health Awareness (Disha) is provided.

“We do lot of mass media campaigns including in radio and these jingles were created with the help of RJs from a private radio station,” said Shinosh K P, senior consultant BCC wing.

“We wanted to give out positive, reassuring messages because right now there is lot of fear and negativity associated with the outbreak. Everyone would be able to relate to it and if the message is appealing their would be more acceptance,” said Shinosh.
