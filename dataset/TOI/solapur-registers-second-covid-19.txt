KOLHAPUR: Solapur city registered its second death due to Covid-19 after a 69-year-old woman admitted to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Sarvopchar Rugnalaya (civil hospital) succumbed to the respiratory disease on Sunday.


District collector Milind Shambharkar said that the patient was suffering from hypertension. Her throat swab sample tested positive on Sunday and the area where she lived, Indira Nagar, has also been cordoned off.

"Indira Nagar has been declared a containment zone. We have identified 8 close contacts of the deceased and they too have been admitted to the civil hospital. Their throat swab samples have been collected and sent for testing. All kinds of transportation in the said area has been shunned and a disinfection drive is underway," he said.

Shambharkar appealed to the citizens to remain indoors for their own safety and cooperate with the administration officials during the door-to-door survey.

The first death reported in Solapur was of a 62-year-old grocery story owner from Paccha Peth area. He was also the first Covid-19 positive case in Solapur. After tracing his close contacts, it was found out that a private hospital nurse from the same area later had contracted the infection from him. The nurseâ€™s contact tracing led to nine more positive cases.

There are still 13 active cases that are being treated at the isolation ward of the civil hospital.
