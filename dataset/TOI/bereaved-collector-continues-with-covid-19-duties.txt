Cuttack: Cuttack collector Bhabani Shankar Chayani continued to monitor the situation in the three containment zones within his jurisdiction though his father passed away on Tuesday. State spokesperson for Covid-19 Subroto Bagchi lauded Chayani’s action at the start of his 4.30 pm briefing for the press.

Informing with regret that Chayani lost his father, Damodar Chayani, who had superannuated as Athgarh sub-collector, Bagchi said the Cuttack collector has decided not to take leave. Damodar Chayani was 98 when he died at the Cuttack collector’s residence at 6.55 am on Tuesday. 

The vehicle carrying his body left for Puri at 11.45 am for his final rites at Swargadwar.

Chayani accompanied his father in his last journey, but not before taking stock of the situation and of the contact tracing process in the containment zones during a meeting with ADM (Revenue) Purna Chandra Mishra, ADM (General) Bijay Kumar Khandayatray and sub-collector (Sadar) Subhransu Mishra.

He also held a meeting with chief district medical officer Dr Satyabrata Chotray to review the door-to-door blood tests in the containment zones.

On Monday, the district administration had declared areas in Salepur and Nischintkoili tehsils as containment zone to prevent spread of Covid-19. The step was taken after it was detected that a person from Jajpur district, who has been found to be Covid-19 positive visited Jairampur village in Nischintkoili tehsil and Kanpur village in Salepur tehsil on March 21, 2020. 

As it required comprehensive contact tracing, the two containment zones were declared to prohibit movement of people. An area within one km radius covering Pension Lane-Pattapole-Sutahat had also been declared containment zone following detection of a Covid 19 positive case in the area.
