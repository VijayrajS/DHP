Despite instructions from the state to stay indoors, several private vehicles, even taxis and autorickshaws, were back on roads on Monday. This prompted the government to restrict their movement. An order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Monday said their use will be restricted to procuring essential commodities, health services and for emergency activities.

“I saw that despite repeated appeals, people had started their non-essential travel on Monday. So we are compelled to take this decision to restrict the use of private vehicles, taxis and autos across the state,” said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He added in case of private vehicles and autos, not more than one passenger will be allowed, besides the driver, and in taxis, two passengers besides the drivers.
