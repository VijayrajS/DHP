Kolkata: Six persons, who recovered from Covid-19 infection, were discharged from a private hospital in Salt Lake on Wednesday, making the total number of novel coronavirus survivors in the state to 79 so far. 

Though the risk of mortality is higher among elderly people, four of the discharged patients were senior citizens, including a 72-year-old Chetla resident, who had been put on ventilation for respiratory distress. On April 11, the septuagenarian was admitted in AMRI Hospitalâ€™s Salt lake unit that has been turned into a Covid hospital. 

Another resident of Abhay Mitra Lane in Shaympukur (77), was released after two consecutive tests showed he was free of the virus. A 63-year-old man from Salt Lake, a 60-year-old man from Park Circus, a 48-year-old man from Howrah and a 34-year-old woman from Garia Station Road were the four others sent home on Wednesday. All of them have been advised home isolation for the next 14 days.
