AHMEDABAD: The facility to conduct tests to detect coronavirus will soon be set up at the Civil Hospital, Asarwa, in Ahmedabad and samples of persons with suspected coronavirus will no longer have to be sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.


Dr Manisha Jain, microbiologist with Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi, who was part of the three-member central government team that visited Gujarat on Wednesday to review preparedness of the state government in view of the coronavirus scare, said in Gandhinagar that the kit required to test coronavirus will be made available in Gujarat soon.

The team inspected infrastructure and facilities that have been put in place at the Ahmedabad airport and Asarwa Civil Hospital – the nodal centre for coronavirus treatment – during the day.

Until Wednesday evening, eight suspected cases of coronavirus had been reported from across the state. The samples of all eight persons have been sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, of which five are negative, while test results of three are awaited.

Meanwhile, the state health department held a series of video conferences with sarpanches and local health workers of all districts, providing them with information on the precautionary steps that people can take to prevent being affected by coronavirus.

Until Wednesday evening, 930 passengers arriving at the Ahmedabad airport from coronavirus-affected countries were screened at the Ahmedabad airport, principal secretary, health, Jayanti Ravi said. “Of the 930 passengers who have been screened, 246 have been home-quarantined and kept under observation,” Ravi added. She said that the central team is satisfied with the arrangements in place in terms of thermal scanners at the airport, availability of masks, ventilators in hospital and training of medical personnel.
