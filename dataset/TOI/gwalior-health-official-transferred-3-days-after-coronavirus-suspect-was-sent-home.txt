BHOPAL: The civil surgeon of Gwalior district hospital was transferred on Monday, three days after a suspected coronavirus patient was asked by doctors at the hospital to go home.


Gwalior chief medical and health officer Dr Mridul Saxena confirmed that the civil surgeon has been shifted but didn’t give any reason. “Dr KD Sharma has been made civil surgeon in place of Dr BK Gupta. The orders have been given by higher-ups and I am not aware of the reasons,” Saxena told TOI. When TOI contacted Dr Gupta for comment, he only said, “I am no longer the civil surgeon.”

The patient had returned from China a fortnight ago and went on his own to Gwalior hospital OPD on reading news reports about the coronavirus risk. Only a day earlier, health minister Tulsiram Silawat had ordered a statewide alert on coronavirus, but doctors at the Gwalior OPD prescribed some medicines and asked the patient to come back after two days

Still anxious, the patient went to another government hospital, Jai Arogya, and then returned home. He was traced later in the night, after senior officials came to know about the incident and sought clarification from the OPD doctors.

The Gwalior CMHO said the suspected coronavirus patient was brought to hospital. “He is under quarantine and in observation. He is stable. Samples have been sent for laboratory tests,” he said.
