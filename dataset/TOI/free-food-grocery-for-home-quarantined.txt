AHMEDABAD: If an entire family – which has a member who has returned from a foreign country – volunteers to be home quarantined for a fortnight, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) will provide all essential supplies free of cost for duration of the quarantine.

From milk and dairy products to groceries and from toiletries to cooked food, all daily requirements of the family will be delivered to their home absolutely free of cost by the civic body.

A decision has been taken to contact each of the 500-odd families in the city, which have members who have returned from foreign countries. AMC officials will try to convince them to opt for voluntary family quarantine. This step has been taken as there is a fair chance of the international passenger having interacted with his or her family members during the home quarantine period.

AMC commissioner Vijay Nehra said that all essential commodities like water, milk, food, dairy products, groceries, toiletries, and even cooked food will be provided absolutely free of cost to those families who opt for remaining confined to their homes for a fortnight. “Our teams will speak to each of the 500-odd families and explain that this is in their interest. The AMC will deliver all these supplies free of cost to their homes,” he added.

The civic body chief explained that in case the international passenger tests positive for coronavirus, the entire family will anyway be quarantined. “We will also provide free sanitizers, masks and other precautionary items to families who opt for voluntary home quarantine,” Nehra said.
