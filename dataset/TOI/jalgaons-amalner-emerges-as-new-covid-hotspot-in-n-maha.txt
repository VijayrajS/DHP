Nashik: Amalner taluka of Jalgaon district has emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot in north Maharashtra.

State government sources said the scenario is Amalner is gradually turning out to be like Malegaon town of Nashik district. Although the number of cases in Amalner is fewer then in Malegaon, the population here is smaller too.

“The state government is paying special attention to Amalner ⁠— as it is doing in the case of Malegaon ⁠— to prevent the spread of the infection,” added senior government sources.

So far, 104 positive cases have been reported from Amalner taluka and nine of them have succumbed to the infection. Also, 27 patients have been discharged after recovery.

At present, there are 10 containment zones in Amalner, including nine within the jurisdiction of the Amalner municipal council. Sources in the civic body said that the old areas of Amalner are very congested, aiding in the spread of the infection.

According to sources in the Jalgaon government medical college and hospital, the majority of the Covid-19 patients who died in the hospital were brought in serious conditions.

“The situation in the taluka is improving. In the last couple of days, there have been no positive cases from the taluka. The local authorities are undertaking a survey of the 28,000-strong population in the taluka to detect Covid-19 patients and quarantine them,” medical officer of Amalner municipal hospital Vilas Mahajan told TOI.

The infection first spread here after an owner of a grocery shop tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Thereafter, about 30 of his family members and close relatives tested positive.
