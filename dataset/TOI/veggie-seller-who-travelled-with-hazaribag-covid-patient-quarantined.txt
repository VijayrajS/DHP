Bokaro: A 42-year-old vegetable seller from Lalpaniya in Gomia block of Bokaro, who travelled with the Hazaribag Covid-19 patient from Asansol on March 29, was taken to an isolation centre on Friday. The man, district officials said, is a relative of the Covid-19 patient. The duo met in Asansol on March 27 and began their journey back to Jharkhand together.

Confirming the development, Bokaro DC Mukesh Kumar said, “The blood and swab samples of the man were sent to Rims in Ranchi on Friday along with two of his family members. All the three have been quarantined.” 

After the 52-year-old Hazaribag man tested positive on Thursday evening, the district administration here swung into action to track down the man. A team of medical experts led by district epidemiologist officer Pawan Kumar Srivastava drew the blood samples and noted the contact history. 

“The man is a vegetable-seller. We are yet to find out why he visited Asansol around 10 days ago,” an official said on condition of anonymity. Upon his return, the suspect went about his business as usual and sold vegetables at a local market in Lalpaniya for three consecutive days, the official added.
