Nashik: Three state universities have decided to declare the lockdown period as their official vacation period.

Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Pune, Kavayitri Bahinabai Choudhari North Maharashtra University (NMU), Jalgaon, and Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU), Nashik, said on Tuesday that all the colleges affiliated with these universities will consider the lockdown period as part of their summer vacations.

SPPU released a circular on Monday and instructed all heads of departments, administrative sections, principals of affiliated colleges and directors of affiliated institutes that the university has declared interim vacation from April 1 to 14.

Prafulla Pawar, the SPPU registrar, said: “Given prevailing Covid-19 situation, the management has taken the decision. Further decisions in the matter will be taken as the need arises.”

The circular states that the faculty members of the university and the affiliated colleges may be called to carry out essential work as and when required. Also, the non-teaching (non-vacation) staff shall continue to work from home during the interim vacation.

According to the university sources, SPPU is also planning to cancel the examinations of the first-year students, but the decision in that regard is yet to be taken.

Taking similar measures, NMU and YCMOU also declared interim vacations on Tuesday.

E Vayunandan, vice-chancellor, YCMOU, said: “We generally break for two months twice a year — once in May-June and then in November-December. This lockdown period shall be adjusted in the coming vacations.”

Deelip Mhaisekar, vice-chancellor, MUHS, said: “Our university functions with a different pattern. We are planning to adjust these days of lockdown in the next academic year’s vacations but no decision has been taken yet.”
