AURANGABAD: A woman from Kalamb taluka of Osmanabad district tested positive for Covid 19 on Friday within hours of getting discharged from the hospital where she was undertaking treatment for the viral infection along with her husband. 

As per official record, the couple reported to the state-run hospital in Kalamb after returning from Mumbai on May 13. 

Medical superintendent at Kalamb government hospital Jeevan Waydande said, “As per the revised protocol of ICMR, Covid-19 patients becoming asymptomatic during the seventh day of treatment cane be discharged on the 10th day. The protocol does not mandate throat swab test for cured patients. However, we decided to carry out the swab test for the couple before discharging as the laboratory in our area did not have much load. While the reports of the woman returned positive, her husband’s test report is inconclusive.” 

Osmanabad district civil surgeon Rajabhau Galande said there were chances of throat swab samples of recovered patients returning positive. “The presence of the dead virus in the body manifests in the form of testing positive for Covid-19. The presence of virus in such form can neither harm the cured patient nor others. Both the woman and her husband have been asked to be in quarantine for seven days and are in good health,” said Galande.

Osmanabad district has reported 27 confirmed Covid-19 cases, most of which are from Kalamb and Paranda talukas. Six patients have been discharged till Saturday.
