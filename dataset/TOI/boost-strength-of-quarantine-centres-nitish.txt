PATNA: In anticipation of return of large number of migrant workers from other states, CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday asked the officials concerned to increase the strength of block and panchayat level quarantine centres in the state, besides toning up the mechanism to deliver health services to the needy.


The CM issued the instructions at a meeting to review the coronavirus situation in the state.

Chief secretary Deepak Kumar and heads of various departments participated in the review meeting. The chief secretary informed the CM that screening of all the migrant workers reaching the state would be done before they are taken to their destination districts and kept at the block level quarantine centres.

How many of the 27.27 lakh migrant workers from Bihar trapped in other states would choose to return following the guidelines announced by the Union ministry of home affairs is not known, but the state is being kept in utmost readiness to handle the situation.

The CM directed the officials concerned to increase the strength of block and panchayat level quarantine centres. “The strength should be increased in proportion to the population of the block,” he said.

The facilities for screening migrant workers at the borders should also be kept in a state of readiness, the CM said, adding the development programmes taken up to create work opportunities for the existing work force and the additional migrant workers should be regularly monitored.

He said the number of vehicles plying on the roads in the rural areas at the block level should also be increased to provide mobility to people at the local level taking in mind social distancing and other guidelines.

The CM said creating increased work opportunities for the needy should also be given utmost consideration.
