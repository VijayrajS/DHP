Most are looking for apartments near campuses as they wait for the Covid-19 pandemic to end. Meanwhile, the consulate general of India, New York, it is believed, has asked students to request their friends to host them. While some are moving in with relatives or requesting locals to accommodate them, many others are toying with the option of flying back home.

A directive from the consulate received by students suggests they stay back as flying back home to India would mean staying under quarantine for 14 days. Moreover, flying via certain countries may affect the student’s entry into India and the USA. The office of the consular general has asked students to request their universities if they can still be accommodated. 

Karan Gupta, a counsellor who works with students wishing to study abroad, said, “As the spread of the virus intensifies, students will have to pair up with friends and look for rental accommodation near their campus.”

Several American universities have asked candidates to not return after the spring break. Universities are running classes via the virtual mode. “If the universities are not accepting applications or have not approved applications for continued housing, ask friends if they will be able to host for the period for which the university has shut down,” the advisory said.

Students have been advised to check with their respective university about how to avail of health services, international student services and any other essential services which are impacted in case on-campus services are suspended.
