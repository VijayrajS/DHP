PRAYAGRAJ: Lakhs of Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteers sang Bharat Mata Vandana in chorus and recited Sangh prayers on Sunday to generate satvik (positive) energy in the universe to defeat Covid-19 virus and for welfare of all human beings.

RSS members, volunteers and their families recited Bharat Mata and Sangh Prathana (prayers) at their homes during Kutumb shakha while following social distancing norms.

A senior RSS functionary told TOI, “We organised a Saamuhik Shakti Jagran in which lakhs of organisation members, volunteers and their families recited Bharat Mata Vandana and Sangh prathana (prayers) at their homes.”

“This was the first time when lakhs of volunteers, workers and their family members prayed for the welfare of the world,” he said.

“We wish to defeat the Covid- 19 virus by generating satvik energy by reciting prayers. It would help in welfare of all human beings,” said another senior functionary.

RSS had taken up a massive campaign on social media to make the event a mega success. All the active members and volunteers of organisation connected online and offline to ensure that the prayers are recited in every household and no volunteer family is left and.

On March 15, all RSS workers had recited the Mahamrityunjaya mantra 108 times at their homes and also held yajna for the welfare of the country.

The RSS volunteers are holding Kutumb shakha at their homes without a miss. The events assume importance since people rang bells, clapped and lit diyas and candles in solidarity with the health workers at the forefront of fight against Covid-19 on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal.
