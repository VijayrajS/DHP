Nagpur: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has started discharging pre-symptomatic positive patients of Covid-19 without testing on 10th day of admission from Isolation Ward as per new guidelines of the central and state governments. It is likely to be followed by Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) from Friday. 21 pre-symptomatic patients were discharged from GMCH on Thursday and over 30 are likely to return home from IGGMCH on Friday.GMCH and IGGMCH were so far discharging patients only after if swab samples of 14th and 15th day came negative. Several patients had to spend over 40 days in Isolation wards. It was also mandatory for them to home quarantine themselves for 14 days. Action was taken against a discharged person for violating home quarantine.TOI had on May 12 reported about the new guidelines of discharging Covid-19 patients. Under these, patients having no symptom on 7th, 8th and 9th days can go home on 10th day and be in home isolation for next seven days. They are liable for action in case of violation.Before discharge, GMCH took an undertaking from 21 patients for abiding home isolation for next seven days. Seventeen of them are from Satranjipura, three from Mominpura, and one from Yashodhara Nagar.Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI, “DMER and public health department had adopted new guidelines giving reference of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). All other cities in the state have begun following them. Hence, GMCH and IGGMCH too adopted them.”Sources said municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe and his team were reluctant to implement the new guidelines considering behaviour of some discharged patients.GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra said, “We are bound to follow the guidelines of the government. Still, we discussed the issue with all stakeholders including the patients for last two days. We also consulted Kumar, NMC, police department and district administration before implementing them. As no separate order was required, we discharged the 21 patients. They were all fit and no one was having any symptom for last three-four days. All of them completed 10-days in Isolation Ward. Some of them had stayed longer,” he said.GMCH also discharged seven more positive persons as per old policy on Thursday.Total number of recoveries from the district increased to 140 and are likely to swell in coming days with new guidelines.On Thursday, three more persons tested positive increasing the district’s tally to 318. Two patients are new cases.A 20-year-old man from Jharkhand was staying at NMC’s shelter home at Timki. He along with a few others was shifted to NMC’s shelter home at Ravi Nagar square on May 12 for sending to their home state. He was having fever and dullness. Therefore, he was admitted at GMCH. His reports came positive on Thursday.Another new case is 65-year-old person from Baba Farid Nagar, Kharbi, on Umrer road in South Nagpur. “He appears to have come from outside so people lodged a complaint with police. A team of police and Pachgaon Primary Health Centre visited his house and admitted him at GMCH three days ago. His reports came positive,” an NMC health official said.This area will be a new containment zone increasing the number to 16. This is ninth case from new area in last 10 days.Third patient is a 28-year-old from Chhoti Masjid, Satranjipura, and was at VNIT Institutional Quarantine Centre.
