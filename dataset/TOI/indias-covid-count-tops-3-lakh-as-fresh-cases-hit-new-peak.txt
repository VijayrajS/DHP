India's Covid count tops 3 lakh as fresh cases hit new peak
2020-06-13
NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 pandemic in India crossed another sombre milepost of 3 lakh cases even as fresh infections zoomed to a new record of 11,775 on Friday, while the death toll grew by 389 to 8,886. 


The coronavirus count in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra also topped 1 lakh during the day, adding another grim statistic in the western state that has so far accounted for a third of India's cases and nearly 42% of deaths. Friday was the second straight day when the tally of new cases topped 11,000, putting India in the third place after Brazil and the US in the list of countries currently with the highest daily caseloads. On Thursday, 11,442 positive cases were recorded.


With this, Covid-19 cases reported by India rose to 3,09,360, as per data from state governments. It took just 10 days for the count to hit 3 lakh after crossing the 2 lakh mark on June 2. The growth rate of the infection, however, reduced from 4.5% to 4% during this period, mainly because of the rising base of cases.

While Maharashtra again accounted for the highest count of new cases at 3,493 - the second-highest in the state after Thursday's peak of 3,607 - it was the massive surge in infections in Delhi that was the latest cause for worry. The capital reported 2,137 fresh cases, breaching the 2,000 mark for the first time.

Delhi on Friday also became the first state in over a month to report a higher daily death toll than Maharashtra. It reported 129 fatalities, higher than 127 by Maharashtra. The total tally of the infection in Delhi was now 36,824. The number of deaths due to Covid-19 had risen to 1,214, the third-highest after Maharashtra (3,717) and Gujarat (1,416).

More worryingly, data shows that 741 (61%) deaths have been reported in the state in the last 12 days, from June 1 to June 12. In March, April and May, Delhi reported 2, 57 and 414 Covid-19 fatalities respectively.

Meanwhile, adding 366 Covid-19 cases, Haryana crossed the 6,000-mark on Friday, the 11th state in the country to do so. It took 93 days for Haryana to get to its first 3,000 cases. For the next 3,000, it took seven days. Gurgaon, with 2,922 cases, alone accounts for 46% of these cases. The surge is in keeping with the national trend, only much sharper in Haryana. 

In Tamil Nadu, another state where infections are raging, hospitals in Chennai have begun to put low-risk patients on the waitlist for admission. The city recorded 1,479 of the 1,982 fresh cases in Tamil Nadu that took the state tally past 40,000. Eighteen deaths were also reported.

The doubling period – time taken for infections to double – is now 14 days for Tamil Nadu and 13 days for Chennai. Of the 18,281 active cases in the state, Chennai is treating 13,906 and hospitals are stretched.

Uttar Pradesh’s Covid-19 chart recorded its highest single-day spike with 538 cases on Friday, pushing the overall score to beyond 12,700-mark. Of the new cases, Gautam Budh Nagar accounted for a maximum of 76 entries which is also maximum in a single day for the district, taking the total to 864, including 379 active cases. The neighbouring Ghaziabad recorded 27 cases taking the total to 581.
