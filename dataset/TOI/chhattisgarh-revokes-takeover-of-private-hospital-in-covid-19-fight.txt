Chhattisgarh revokes takeover of private hospital in Covid-19 fight
2020-04-05
RAIPUR: Barely nine days after acquiring a private hospital for Covid-19 treatment, Chhattisgarh government on Friday rolled back its decision, citing insufficient infrastructure and medical facilities at Raipur Institute of Medical sciences. The government-run Ambedkar Hospital will be dedicated to the corona fight, instead.


RIMS was the only private medical facility acquired by the Chhattisgarh government under Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. AIIMS-Raipur and district hospitals are treating coronavirus patients. Now, Ambedkar Hospital will join the group.

According to state health officials, post-acquisition inspections showed that the private hospital was short of medical facilities and infrastructure. Upgrading it would entail heavy expenses, and - more importantly - time.

Time is crucial in the fight against Covid-19, as the administration cannot divert focus from battling the pandemic. When the government set about upgrading facilities, it realized that the money could be better spent in improving medical care during the pandemic.
