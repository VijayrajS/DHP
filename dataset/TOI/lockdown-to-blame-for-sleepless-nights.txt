Lockdown to blame for sleepless nights?
2020-05-23
VISAKHAPATNAM: Sleep patterns of the public have gone for a toss since the lockdown began as young couples juggle dealing with young children without the help of the house help, while also working from home. 


Many are stuck all by themselves with nobody to talk to, no one to provide physical or mental support. Some are not getting enough sleep and others don’t seem to be able to wake up on time. 

“Anxiety spurred on by the pandemic seeping into dreams and messing up sleep patterns is a common occurrence,” Dr. Bala Raju Tadikonda, a pulmonologist and sleep expert said. “Ever since the lockdown, we have been getting a lot of phone calls about irregular sleep. Not just from people who already have sleep disorders, but also from those who have other lung-related issues,” he added. 

Uncertainty about the future is a recurring theme of what people are feeling. Covid-19 news alerts, a constant stream of statistics and stress from thinking about all this reflects the quality of sleep. “You could either have a problem with sleep onset or a problem with sleep maintenance and frequent fracturing of sleep. When you have an anxiety overlay, the kind of sleep that gets most disturbed is N3 (the third phase of Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep,” child specialist Mustaq Ahmad said. 

Anxiety is just one side of the coin. The lockdown has changed one’s bodily rhythms and even the dietary patterns. This too is affecting sleep and also causing digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, which aggravates insomnia, another doctor said.
