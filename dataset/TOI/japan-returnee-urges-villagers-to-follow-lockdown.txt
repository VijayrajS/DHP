KOLKATA: The Diamond Harbour sub-divisional administration in South 24 Parganas district has roped in Swarup Chapadar, who was among 138 Indians stranded in Oklahoma, Japan on board cruise liner Diamond Princess after several crew members had tested positive for Covid-19, to spread awareness in villages about the importance to remain indoors during the lockdown. 

Chapadar was among 119 Indians - 113 crew members and six passengers - who had reached New Delhi from Tokyo by an Air India flight on March 13. All of them were taken to the Indian Army's camp in Gurgaon. They underwent regular check-ups and tests for Covid-19. Chapadar, however,had tested negative for the virus. But he remained quarantined at the camp with other Indians on board the cruise liner. 

After the mandatory two-week quarantine, Chapadar reached home on March 27. Now, he responded to the Diamond Harbour sub-divisional administration’s plea to campaign in villages to spread awareness on abiding by the lockdown to keep the Covid-19 threat at bay. 

He is going around the villages with a microphone, asking people to wear masks and gloves whenever they need to step out of home to buy essentials. Besides, he is also telling everyone why they should remain indoors. 

Diamond Harbour SDO, Sukanto Saha, said, “Apartment from this awareness campaign, he will also conduct another campaign for those who have returned from other states and advised to remain in isolation at home.” 

Chapadar said, “This is my social responsibility. I have to explain to people how important it is to remain indoors for protection from this virus.” The luxury cruise ship docked off at Yokohama in Japan had 138 Indians on board.
