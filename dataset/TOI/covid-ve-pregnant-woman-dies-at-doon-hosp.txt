DEHRADUN: A 30-year-old woman, who was seven-month pregnant, died at Doon Hospital on Saturday. The deceased, a resident of Shamli in Uttar Pradesh, was found Covid-19-positive on Sunday. Doctors at Government Doon Medical College and Hospital (GDMCH), however, claim that the victim died due to refractory status epileptic with turerculoma. The patient was brought to the hospital last week. She was cremated in Dehradun as her kin didn't get the nod to take the body to Shamli.

This is the third death of a Covid-19 positive patient in the state. In the earlier two cases as well, the doctors had said that the patients didn't die because of coronavirus.

On the day, 73 new Covid-19 cases were reported from Uttarakhand taking the state’s tally to 317. The new cases were reported from Nainital (32), Dehradun (12), Udham Singh Nagar (9), Chamoli (8), Almora (3), Bageshwar (2), Tehri (3), Champawat (1), and Pauri (1). Two other positive patients, found in Uttarakhand, migrated to other states.

“After spike in Covid-19 cases in all 13 districts of Uttarakhand, the entire state has now been placed in the orange zone,” said additional secretary (health) Yugal Kishore Pant.

Meanwhile, two more positive cases recovered fully from the disease on Tuesday. With this, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in the state has dropped to 4.18 days and the recovery rate has dipped below 18%. The state, at present, has 257 active cases.
