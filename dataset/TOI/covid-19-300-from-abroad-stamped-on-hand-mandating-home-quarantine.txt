Covid-19 scare in Aurangabad: 300 from abroad stamped on hand mandating home-quarantine
2020-03-21
AURANGABAD: The civic administration has started stamping the hands of people who have recently returned from other countries to India with indelible ink. The stamp is a reminder for people so that they stay under home-quarantine for 14 days as a preventive measure against coronavirus.


However, in one case, it was found that the ink used by Aurangabad Muncicipal Corporation (AMC) for the stamp was normal ink and not the indelible one used for marking fingers of voters during elections. As soon as the person washed his hands, the stamp too washed away. 

District collector Uday Choudhari stated on Thursday that all individuals who have travelled out of India over the last two months should voluntarily report to the AMC and get themselves screened.

According to municipal officer of health Nita Padalkar, health professionals conduct extensive screening of such persons. Even if they are found having no symptoms, they are asked to home-quarantine for 14 days and counselled to take necessary precautions. District collector Uday Choudhari said more than 300 people have been stamped so far. 

Meanwhile, the district civil hospital screened 50 patients on Friday. Currently, four patients are admitted in the isolation ward of the hospital. “Of the 19 throat swabs sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, from Aurangabad, one has tested positive, 14 have tested negative while four were rejected. We are awaiting the reports of 24 more swab samples,” said district civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni. 

The AMC has screened more than 24,500 people through its different screening centres till Friday.
