MADURAI: The southern districts of Theni, Dindigul and Sivaganga reported their first Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday, with Theni reporting the highest of 20, all of whom had attended the Tablighi meet at Nizamudeen in Delhi. This has taken the total number of positive cases in the southern districts to 95.


As the government had asked the people who had participated in the conference to come forward for voluntary testing, it led to a rise in the number of positive cases in the districts.

While the positive cases had been shifted to the isolation ward at the GRH. health officials were also monitoring some of those screened who showed minor symptoms like cough and cold. They had been given medication and would be screened again on Thursday to rule out the disease, he said.
