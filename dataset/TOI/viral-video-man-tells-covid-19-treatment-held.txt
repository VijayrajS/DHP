PITHORAGARH: A 28-year-old man was held by city police on Tuesday for uploading a video on social media in which he is explaining the “treatment” for coronavirus.


In the video uploaded on Facebook, the accused Santosh Kumar suggests people to dig a hole on the left side of the door of their home. He asks people to keep digging till they find a “coal-type thing” and then rub that material on their forehead.

“Kumar claims that rubbing that coal thing will protect people and their families from the deadly coronavirus,” Priti Priyadarshni, SP Pithoragarh, told TOI.

The official added that the cyber cell traced Kumar, a resident of Jhulaghat’s Kanadi village, after the matter came to the fore. A case under sections 188, 269 of the IPC and 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act has been lodged against Kumar at Jhulaghat police station.
