As The Palaniswami Government, In A Questionable Move, Announced The Four-Day Total Lockdown In Short Notice, It Was... Sheer Madness
2020-04-26
Thousands of people, including those in containment zones, thronged markets and grocery stores in Madurai on Saturday defying curfew restriction to store essentials a day before a four-day complete lockdown proposed by the state government in some cities including Madurai took effect from 6 am on Sunday.

As people went in for panic purchase, vendors ran out of stocks and started leaving as early as 9 am. Serpentine queues of people — standing or moving in close proximity — could be found everywhere throwing caution to the wind and jeopardising the lockdown already in place for over a month. At some places, police presence made them stand in line and maintain social distance, but inside markets the norms went for a toss as people vied with each other to buy vegetables. 

M Muthulakshmi, a resident of Jaihindpuram, said when she reached the market, traders had stared leaving after sale. Those who had something left, sold them at higher price. “A kg of tomato, which was sold at Rs 15 till Friday, was sold for Rs 30. Fresh vegetables were already sold off and what was left was old. We did not have an option, but to buy them,” she said. There were takers even for dry, blackened lady’s finger and carrots, which otherwise would have gone to the garbage pile. 

V Selvam, a vendor at Wakf Board College ground, said he reached there with his usual vegetable consignment of onion, potato, lady’s finger and brinjal weighing about 200 kgs. If he used to leave with at least half of it unsold, on Saturday he could sell all his stock before 9 am.

With grinding mills open at many places despite having no permission to function, large crowds gathered outside them. People also came onto the streets trying to locate the mobile vegetable markets being operated by Madurai corporation but these were nowhere in sight. Bakeries and snack shops were also crowded. S Janakan, a resident of Anna Nagar, who came out of his house to purchase groceries, said, “what is the guarantee that government will not extend complete lockdown after Wednesday. It is important we store extra,” he said. ``I spent a good Rs 1,500 buying 10 packets of Aavin milk, sugar, flour, biscuits, sarbath, sauce, cornflakes, maggie and what not as they were the only things available,’’ said S Ganeshan of Thapalathanthi Nagar. 

A higher police officer said there were huge crowd at markets, but they did not go out of control. However, he expressed their inability to stop people from leaving their house. “We cannot stop people from leaving houses but can only register case against them and seize vehicles, which we are doing regularly. They should have some responsibility and be careful not to get into crowded places,” he said.

``The CM’s announcement that shops could remain open till 3 pm came at 11 am, but by that time all shops had closed. They should make such announcements after creating enough awareness,’’ said Selvaraj, a resident.

President of Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar Association D Raghavan, who helps people in the contained areas, said he called up mobile vegetable vans at 9 am. ``They told me people waylaid them and bought Rs 100 bags in bulk and there was nothing to bring,’’ he said, adding that such situations were a cause of grave concern.
