PATNA: Village chowkidars and field officers will now be roped in to gather information about any coronavirus suspect in the rural areas. It was decided in a meeting of chief secretary Deepak Kumar with senior officials of the state on Saturday.


“Many people will be coming home on Holi. So, we have instructed all the district magistrates and other officials to avail the service of chowkidars and other field officers working in villages to keep a tab on their surroundings. If any suspect is found, he will be given necessary medical attention,” Deepak told TOI. He further said special gram sabha meetings are scheduled across the state from March 16 to take people’s view about various government schemes and their expectations. People will also be told about coronavirus and precautions needed.

He said the government machinery was fully prepared to tackle any untoward situation. “As of now, no confirmed case of coronavirus has been reported. But we have kept our fingers crossed because of the way it is spreading,” said Deepak. He also said health machinery will remain functional even during Holi.

State health department also held a training programme of district health officials on Saturday. They were told how to collect samples, use personal protective equipment kit and give right information to people who were also being misled by social media. These officials will now train block level health officials after Holi. Sources said state health officials were given similar training by Union health ministry in New Delhi a day before.

As per a press release issued by state health society, total 122 people who had returned from countries infected by coronavirus after January 15 had been kept in isolation and 59 of them have completed their 14 days observation period. Also, of the total 50 samples collected so far, no positive case has been found in Bihar.
