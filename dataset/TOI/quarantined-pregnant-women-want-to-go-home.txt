Quarantined pregnant women want to go home
2020-06-04
Panaji: At least a dozen pregnant women who arrived on the first direct Vande Bharat flight to Goa from Dubai and have been forced to undergo institutional quarantine are waiting for their test results in the hope that they will be sent home. 

One of the ladies entering her eighth month of pregnancy got a doctor to check her blood pressure and sugar at her quarantine centre at Patto, on Wednesday. 

“I’m close to my delivery date and I’m getting very apprehensive. Clause 2 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare guidelines for international arrivals clearly state that pregnant women be sent on home quarantine, but authorities are not listening to us. What happens if my contractions start,” she said.

She told TOI that she has hasn’t been able to rest either as she has to take care of her four-year-old child, who travelled with her from Dubai. 

The lady booked her ticket to travel to Goa in March but got stuck when the lockdown kicked in. 

Another woman in her fourth month of pregnancy told TOI that the excuse given to them that the state has set stricter guidelines than MHA would have been acceptable if the Goa government has published these. “You can’t expect to come here and then be told that the SOP has been changed. The health secretary also said we violated norms we signed but there should have been clear SOPs published ,” she said.
