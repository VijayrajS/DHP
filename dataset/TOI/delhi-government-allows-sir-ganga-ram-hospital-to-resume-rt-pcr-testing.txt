2020-06-14
NEW DELHI: The state government on Saturday allowed Sir Ganga Ram Hospital to resume testing for coronavirus, almost 10 days after it had prohibited the medical institute from conducting tests for the viral infection. 

 In an order issued on June 3, Delhi government had prohibited the hospital from carrying out RT-PCR sampling for Covid-19 suspect/contact cases. 

 "We have now been authorised to use the RT-PCR app. With this, the hospital can start conducting tests for Covid-19 patients as per the government guidelines," Dr D S Rana, chairman of the hospital's board of management said in a statement. 

Dr Rana thanked the government for the intervention and expressed its whole-hearted support in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic. 

The Aam Aadmi Party government later lodged an FIR against the hospital alleging that it wasn't using the app till June 3; almost a month after an order was issued mandating all accredited labs to collect samples only through the app, so that all suspected cases could be tracked and monitored.
