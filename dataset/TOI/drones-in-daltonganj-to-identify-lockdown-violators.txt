DALTONGANJ: In order to ensure social distancing and complete adherence to lockdown norms, Palamu Police started aerial surveillance with drones on Tuesday. SP Ajay Linda said a successful trial run was made in the market area of Daltonganj town on Tuesday and slowly, more areas will be covered.

“The town area has a population of around one lakh with several congested colonies. The drones will help us maintain law and order during the lockdown,” Linda said.

He added, “It will also act as a deterrent for the violators of the lockdown. We have not used any coercive force against flouters so far, but we will not abstain from drawing criminal cases against them if need be.” 

Linda informed sadar SDPO Sandip Kumar Gupta has been assigned the task to use drones as per requirement. Speaking to TOI, Gupta said, “We have observed that from 6am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm, there is a sudden surge of people on the streets which needs to be controlled. We shall use the drones to identify the flouters.”

Majority of the people who venture out on the streets during the morning or evening hours are the ones who want to purchase essentials. However, there are some who venture out for walks and to meet with friends., authorities said.
