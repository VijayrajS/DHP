Prayagraj: Police on Friday prohibited the sale, storage and purchase of kites and Chinese manjha (kite string) in the city during the lockdown enforced in view of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Those found violating the norms would be booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. 

SP (city) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava said, “We have noticed that residents are flying kites in groups on the terrace of their homes or streets during the lockdown, thereby flouting social distancing norms.” 

He said that police have also noticed that kite flyers were flouting social distancing norms by going to shops to purchase kites and manjha. In view of such violations, police have decided to prohibit the sale, storage and purchase of kites and manjha.

The SP said that many people have been injured by the sharp Chinese manjha and the kites also cause damage to power transmission lines.
