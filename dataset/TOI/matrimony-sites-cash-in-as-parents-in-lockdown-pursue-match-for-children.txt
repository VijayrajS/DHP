Matrimony sites cash in as parents in lockdown pursue match for children
2020-06-06
CHENNAI: Lockdown appears to be the best time to find a ‘better-half’ as matchmaking websites see a surge in renewals.

“The Covid pandemic will not be the end of life. We (parents) still have a duty to find a match for our children. I have recharged and upgraded my daughter’s profile on the matrimony site from premium to classic premium for the next three months. With more time in hand, I want to assess more profiles before I take a decision,” said 59-year-old S Sujatha. 

 

Matrimony.com has seen more new customers enrolling with 30% growth in April, 2020, compared to previous month. “On the collections side, we grew by 26% and stood at 94 crore in Q4FY20, compared to the previous quarter and by 6% on a yearly basis,” said Murugavel Janakiraman, founder and CEO of Matrimony.com. 

Though other businesses may have seen degrowth, matchmaking has seen an increase in profile growth in FY21 (April and May). Besides offering discounts on registration fees, matchmaking companies have provided video calling facilities. Launched during the lockdown period, the video calling feature of Jeevansathi, a subsidiary of Info Edge Ltd, allowes users to engage with in-app calling without sharing their mobile numbers or moving away from the platform.

In a regulatory filing, Jeevansathi said its collections grew by 26% (4 crore) in Q4 until mid-March, and added 1 crore in April, 2020. The company statement said post announcements of lockdown, collections did slow down slightly to 20% YoY at the end of March, 2020. However, with the extension, collections picked up and grew at a modest 11% YoY in April.

Its head of business, Rohan Mathur said, “The platform witnessed a 60% increase in the number of voice and video calls in the lockdown period with more user-engagement.”
