NEW DELHI: As many as 472 new Covid-19 cases have been confirmed and 11 more deaths reported, taking the total number of cases in the country to 3,374 and the death toll to 79, the health ministry said on Sunday.


However, a PTI tally of figures reported by states directly showed at least 106 deaths across the country, while the confirmed cases reached 3,624. Of them, 284 have been cured and discharged.

There has been a lag in the Union health ministry figures, compared to the numbers announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.
