Nagpur: The banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) has claimed that Gadchiroli police’s C-60 commandos shot dead divisional committee (DVC) member Srujan Akka alias Jaini Arka at Sinbatti village when the woman rebel leader was spreading awareness on Covid-19.

The Maoists have also called a ‘bandh’ in Gadchiroli on May 20 to protest the alleged killing. Srujan Akka had nearly 146 offences against her and a reward of Rs16 lakh. 

Currently, Maoists are observing Tactical counter offensive campaign during which they step up violence.

In a statement released by the North Gadchiroli division committee, Maoists have alleged Srujan Akka was killed in a cold-blooded manner and not during combat.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said that the administration and police department are engaged in strategic information dissemination and creating awareness about Covid-19 among tribals. “The Maoists neither have resources nor awareness to give tribals information about coronavirus,” he said.

The SP said that Maoists are visiting villages to disrupt ongoing infrastructure development works and also targeting contractors for extortion.

“It is common for Maoists to target tendu contractors, road and construction companies for extortion. Sinbhatti villagers had requested the Maoists to allow the contractors to build roads citing hardship faced during monsoon. The Maoists were trying to convince them to set vehicles of contractors on fire,” said the SP. 

According to a source, Srujan Akka was at the village to meet an agent of the contractor who has already paid some amount to Maoists. There was pressure for coughing up few more lakhs for allowing the work to continue.
