2020-04-26
HYDERABAD: GHMC’s directorate of enforcement, vigilance & disaster management (EVDM) sealed two supermarkets — Vijeta Supermarket, Chandanagar and Value Mart Supermarket, Madhuranagar on Saturday for not following social distancing guidelines. According to EVDM officials, social distancing was not followed inside the two supermarkets and many people were allowed inside the supermarket at the same time.

“Based on complaints, the supermarkets were inspected. Surprise inspections were done on Saturday and the stores sealed were found flouting norms,” EVDM director Vishwajit Kampati said.

 

The stores sealed should provide an affidavit after which they can reopen. “As it is a first time violation we are allowing them to open after they provide an affidavit. If any store violates the rules for the second time, we will shut it down indefinitely and also pursue a criminal case,” said Kampati. 

 


One of the store owners also argued with EVDM staffers. In his defense, he said his store was big enough to accommodate the crowd. Some supermarkets were flouting norms, while several of them were strictly following guidelines. The outlets following guidelines did not allow people without a mask and ensured social distancing. Guidelines to be followed by customers were also pasted on entry/exit doors of some stores in the city.

“Only one person per family allowed, no entry without masks and maintain social distancing’ were the guidelines pasted on entry and exit doors. In April, a total of four supermarkets have been sealed, including the ones sealed today.

Staffers not wearing safety gear and stores ignoring social distancing led to sealing of some stores earlier this month.
