Delhi Covid-19 lockdown: Ration may soon be delivered at doorstep
2020-04-01
NEW DELHI: Delhi government may soon start delivering dry ration to a section of beneficiaries covered under National Food Security Act 2013 at their doorstep.


Sources said the food and civil supplies department is working on a plan to send the ration—wheat, rice and sugar—to senior citizens, widows, differently abled and other vulnerable sections. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday expressed his concern over sudden rush of people at city’s fair price shops to collect their monthly entitlement of foodgrains.

In view of lockdown to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading, the government has started giving 1.5 times of the actual entitlement of ration for the month of April free of cost to over 71 lakh beneficiaries covered under public distribution system.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday also announced that the government was trying to explore sources where it can procure foodgrain from to provide ration to those not covered under the NFSA – 2013.

While Delhi government officials said the food and civil supplies department was still working on the modalities and no final decision had been taken, sources said only vulnerable section would be covered under doorstep delivery of ration during the lockdown period.

According to the data available on the website of the food and civil supplies department, 71,08,074 members of 17,50,523 families are covered under the food security act in the national capital. There are 2,011 fair price shops in Delhi to cater to more than 17 lakh beneficiary families.

While the government had instructed distribution of ration from March 30, some fair price shops opened two days earlier and witnessed long queues of card-holders. This has forced the government to explore other options.
