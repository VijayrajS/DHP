RANCHI: A day after a foreign national, who was a part of the Tablighi Jamaat, tested positive for Covid-19, Ranchi Police are contemplating legal action against the people who hosted the group without providing prior information about their arrival to the city.


Speaking to TOI, Ranchi SSP Anish Gupta said, “Right now we are verifying the credentials of the foreign nationals who were part of the religious group and were found from a mosque and private residences in Hindpiri area on late Sunday night. I have instructed a DSP rank official to conduct an enquiry about their Visas and whether they had completed all the necessary documentation upon their arrival to the state capital. After examining the facts, we will initiate necessary legal action against the culprits.”

Meanwhile, police sources confirmed that the foreigners did not inform the foreign registration office in the state capital upon their arrival.
