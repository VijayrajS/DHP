Hyderabad: Expecting mummy from UK quarantined
2020-03-27
HYDERABAD: While the entire country is on lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, not everyone seems to have got the memo of how serious the matter is. A woman who is nine months pregnant arrived in Hyderabad from London on March 16 and did not isolate herself for the mandatory 14-day period.


The house she is staying in at present in Kukatpally, has a nine-month-old infant and three-year-old toddler apart from a senior citizen. Since arriving in the city, the woman has been interacting with people freely. That is, until a few days ago when GHMC officials showed up at the doorstep of the Kukatpally house and asked her about her travel history. “We are hesitant to travel as far as Gandhi hospital to get tested. Moreover, since it’s a hospital, we don’t want to risk exposing her to the diseases there,” a family member said, adding that they have been put on isolation until March 30. “Since yesterday we have deployed 20 teams to check on foreign returnees,” GHMC deputy commission Prashanti Vangeepuram said.
