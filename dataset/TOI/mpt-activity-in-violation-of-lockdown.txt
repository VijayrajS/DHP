‘Mormugao Port Trust activity in violation of lockdown’
2020-04-09
PANAJI: State government has violated the strict lockdown protocol imposed in Goa by permitting shipping activity at Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) and in the inland waterways, the Congress party said here on Wednesday.


It wrote to governor Satya Pal Malik urging him to stop the transportation of coal and iron ore, saying that government’s “pick and choose method” of granting permission smacked of corruption.

A bulk carrier with coal from South Africa, MV Ikan Pulas, is docked at MPT. The coal is transported to Amona on smaller barges. Another bulk carrier MV Pedhoulas Builder is at MPT offloading other cargo. “The vessel management has not followed the principles of self-quarantine. These illegal activities cannot happen without active support of government,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar.
