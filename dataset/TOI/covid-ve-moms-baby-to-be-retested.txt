2020-06-14
Panaji: The first baby born to a Covid+ mother at the Covid-19 hospital on Friday will be retested on Sunday. 

Although the baby tested negative at birth, doctors say this doesn’t mean anything and that the new born will be tested between 45-72 hours. 

The baby is presently under the care of the paediatric team at GMC, away from her mother who is admitted at the Covid hospital in Margao. The baby will be taken near her mother if she tests positive. 

The baby has developed jaundice due to ABO incompatibility (incompatibility between the mother’s and baby’s blood groups) and is being treated at the GMC. “The baby is receiving phototherapy for the jaundice and is stable,” a doctor said. 

The woman from Vasco’s Mangor Hill was admitted at the Covid-19 hospital on Friday afternoon and gave birth to a baby girl within a few hours. Doctors wore full PPE while performing the C-section and shifted the baby out of the Covid hospital to GMC’s paediatric ward.
