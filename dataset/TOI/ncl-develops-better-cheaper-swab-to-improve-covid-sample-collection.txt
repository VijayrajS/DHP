NCL develops better, cheaper swab to improve Covid sample collection
2020-06-07
Pune: The National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) has developed a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab to collect samples from the throat cavity for conducting Covid-19 tests. 

The new swabs can be priced at at one-fourth the cost of imported swabs currently being used in the country.

Chandrashekhar Rode, scientist emeritus at the Pune-based NCL, said, “India is using imported swabs. There’s currently a shortage in China because there is high demand for swabs all over the world. Doctors have had to use earbuds due to lack of swabs. In April, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research was consulted by the Centre need for swabs. The NCL was tasked to manufacture them.” A CSIR-NCL team, including Prakash Wadgaonkar, Anuya Nisal and Wode, then worked out specifications for a new swab. “The swabs should be delicate enough to not hurt patients. But they should be strong enough to scrape the throat for samples. Second, the sample collected is a mucus fluid. The swab material should absorb the sample and not the mucus fluid. Finally, a swab is transferred to a viral transport medium. Here, the swab must be able to release at least 80% of the absorbed sample,” said Rode. 

The research unit has transferred the technology to a Mumbai-based chemical company. “It will first need a nod from the Drug Controller General of India. After that, it has the capacity to produce at least 1 lakh swabs per day,” said Prabhakar Ingle, principal scientist, science communication, at NCL.
