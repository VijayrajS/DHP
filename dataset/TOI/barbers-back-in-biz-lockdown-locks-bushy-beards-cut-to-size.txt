Madurai: G Senthil, a resident of Anna Nagar, has been keenly waiting for barber shops to open so that he could get rid of his unkempt hair which had overgrown in two months as the shops closed just before the day he was planning to have a cut.

“My wife did offer to cut my hair, but I was not ready to take the risk. Shaving was not a problem as I have been doing it myself,” he said. A large number of people like Senthil hit salons in Madurai early on Sunday after the government relaxed restrictions for salons. The hairdressers disinfected the shops on Saturday itself and turned up in full strength on Sunday morning to make the most of it. 

M Velmurugan, human resource manager of Vinitas hair and makeup, said they are following all precautionary measures prescribed by the government. Customers are made to wait with mandatory social distancing, provided hand sanitizer and their temperature checked before being let inside. “We frequently disinfect the shop, ensure mask and gloves for hair stylists and customers are also made to wear mask. Disposable apron is provided to customers to ensure safety,” he said.

N M Shanmugam, president of Madurai City Maruthuvar Association, said there are 2,000 barber shops in the corporation limits alone, employing more than 5,000 people. “I can tell you 99 % of barber shops in the city follow the government’s instructions and ensure safety of customers and hairstylists. It has been a tough two months with the shops shut. We had to provide salary and also pay rent without any income,” he said. 

He demanded that the state government expedite distribution of Rs 2,000 to every barber as lockdown relief. “We have been approaching various offices, but officials are clueless on the procedure to apply for it,” he said.
