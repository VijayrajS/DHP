Telangana: Lockdown hurdle for Ganesh and Durga idol-makers
2020-05-26
HYDERABAD: Idol artisan Kailash Singh Hazari’s workshop at Dhoolpet is usually buzzing with activity at this time of the year with half-ready idols lined up at one side, waiting for the final touches and the last coat of paint. With the lockdown getting extended, Singh is not able to source raw materials to complete the idols and deliver it to customers and pandal organisers.


To get Ganesh idols ready by August, the work starts as early as January, said the idol-maker. “In January, we buy raw material like plaster of Paris, jute, glue ,etc., during that time, as prices go up during the monsoon. We also book workers, especially the artist who specialises in drawing details like eye, hand folds, lips, etc by paying advance by February,” Singh added. He had booked nearly 15 workers and artists from Maharastra, Karnataka and West Bengal, paying amounts ranging between 5,000 and 15,000 each, apart from another 3 lakh for the raw materials. He is now falling short of money with the lockdown extended. He fears that he might not get any profit selling the idols this year.

A member of Hyderabad Ganesh Idol Artisans’ Welfare Association said that most artists earn during festivals. “The last couple of festivals like Ugadi and Ram Navami were a low-key affair. Even the size of Khairtabad Ganesh idol, which was expected to be more than 60 foot tall, has also been reduced drastically,” Raj Kumar Singh, another idol-maker and president of Dhoolpet Ganesh Idol Artisans’ Welfare Association, told TOI.
