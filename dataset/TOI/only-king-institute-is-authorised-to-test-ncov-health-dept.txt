Only King Institute is authorised to test coronavirus: Health department
2020-02-07
TRICHY: The department of public health and preventive medicines has categorically stated that no other lab except King Institute in Chennai has been authenticated to conduct tests to confirm novel coronavirus (nCoV) in the state. 

“Taking serious view of information from some other places in the state that private hospitals performed lab test to confirm nCoV, I want to make it clear that no one has been authorised except King Institute to carry out the lab test to check the infection of the new strain of the coronavirus,” said deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr A Subramani, here on Thursday. 

He was speaking at the awareness meetings for the staff of 117 private hospitals, 82 PHCs including UPHCs, 13 government hospitals and one government medical college hospital (Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital) in the city. 

“Though we have no such complaints here, private hospitals should be clearly communicated about the matter as it will trigger panic among the people in case of any misleading results. Of the seven strains of corona virus, four are non-lethal but the three others including nCoV are lethal. If one conducts a swab test, it may indicate infection of any one of the four corona viruses, but it may not be the latest nCoV,” DDHS told TOI. 

He also said that the treatment for the suspects should also be done at MGM government hospital.
