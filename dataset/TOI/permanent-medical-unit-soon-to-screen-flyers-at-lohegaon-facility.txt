Coronavirus: Permanent medical unit soon to screen flyers at Lohegaon facility
2020-01-29
PUNE: With most of the country on its toes for any signs of coronavirus, the city airport is set to get a permanent virus screening facility. 


The facility — to be staffed by qualified medical professional — is being set up by Airports Authority of India in coordination with the Union health ministry, an airport official close to the development said. 

Currently, seven airports across the country — not including Pune — have been instructed to screen and check passengers in the wake of the global coronavirus outbreak. 

“The airport authorities have provided space in the terminal building for the unit,” the official said, adding that work was underway. “It will take 10 days to be ready,” the official added. 

The facility will be equipped to vaccinate — and if necessary, quarantine — any passenger infected with any virus.

G Chanderamouli, AAI’s western regional director, said the immigration desk and customs officials are keeping a close eye on arriving international passengers. “The passengers’ points of origin are being monitored. Any suspicious case will be referred to the medical team,” Chanderamouli said.

Customs officials said they had sent 3 to 4 people — who had come to Pune from China via Dubai — for a general check-up after some suspicions.
