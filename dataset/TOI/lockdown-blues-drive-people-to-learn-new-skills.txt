2020-05-15
LUCKNOW: Rishi Shukla, a law student at Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, never used to touch a wire as he was afraid of electric shock but he can now fix electrical appliances at home.

Rishi used his free time to surf the internet to learn the technicalities. Like him, a number of people are trying their hands on plumbing, gardening and even hair-cutting during lockdown.

“My father didn’t allow us to switch on the air-conditioner since its servicing was not done. However, soaring temperatures made me put aside all my fears and I carried out the servicing myself after learning about it through the internet,” he says.

“After I was successful, I tried my hands at my TV and repaired it too. However, I could not fix the fault in my mixer grinder after browsing many videos online,” adds Rishi.

Similarly, Ambrish Bhargava who never held scissors even for art and craft is now busy giving hair cut to all children of his family by watching Jawed Habib video.

“I don’t want my children eyes to become weak. Long hair are irritating them so I have decided to give hair cut not only to them but also to other members of my family,” he says.

From fixing leaking pipes to maintaining their own gardens people are taking up many roles during lockdown.

“I have never ever watered a plant in my life but during lockdown, I am looking after my garden and have pruned more than 50 pots,” says Rishi.
