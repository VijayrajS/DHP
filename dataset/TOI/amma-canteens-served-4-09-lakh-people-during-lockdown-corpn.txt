Madurai: Madurai corporation has provided food for 4.09 lakh people during the lockdown between March 23 and April 28 through 12 Amma canteens in the city, the corporation officials have claimed.Amma canteens, which have been serving two meals a day, extended the service making it available in the night also as people have nowhere else to go for food during the lockdown. On a day, more than 20, 000 idly, 850 pongal, 1500 sambar rice, 2000 curd rice, 1500 coconut rice, 1500 lemon rice, 700 upma and 100 to 200 veg biryani are served at the canteens.The number of people benefitting from Amma canteens in the city went up during the lockdown and has gone further up during the four-day complete lockdown from Sunday to Wednesday. Officials said that the number spiked by at least 10 to 15% during the intensive lockdown period.“Corporation commissioner has told us to increase the production of food if the number of people visiting the canteen is up. While food has been already served at a subsidized price, it is now being served free after AIADMK offered to sponsor it for the past 10 days. The canteen saw more crowd since food was served free,” an health department official said.P Sevugan, 55, a carpenter from Munichalai said that he used to eat food at roadside eateries before the lockdown. But for him, Amma canteen is the only option now as shops and hotels have been closed.“The quality of food served is good. Since food is now served free, those who could not afford now benefit a lot,” he said. V Suseela, a servant from Alwarpuram, who is living with her 10-year-old boy said they have been regularly having food at Amma Canteen. ·
