PUNE: A 25-year-old coronavirus-positive woman gave birth to a healthy baby boy at the Sassoon General Hospital here on Saturday, the first instance of its kind since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the city. 

“The swab samples of the baby boy tested negative,” said the doctor who led the team of medical professionals who performed a C-section on the woman for the baby’s delivery. “The baby, weighing 3.5kg, is healthy and doing well in an isolation chamber,” he said. 

On Saturday, doctors at the Aurangabad’s district civil hospital performed a similar surgery on a woman who gave birth to a baby girl. The baby too tested negative for Covid-19.

The Sassoon doctor said, “The woman, a resident of old Khadki area, was in her ninth month of pregnancy when admitted to the hospital on April 16 with throat irritation, fever and other symptoms. We kept her under medical care and observation. The results of her swab samples came positive for Covid-19 the following day. Her condition is fine after delivery.”

He said, “With proper care, our nurses will take the mother’s milk for feeding the baby separately. Breastfeeding is not advisable under present condition. There is no proof that the virus can be transmitted through breastfeeding. But we do not wish to take any chance.” 

The Sassoon hospital authorities said they have prepared a dedicated protocol for taking care of Covid-19 infected pregnant women. “We have a separate strategy for treating such patient and have doctors and nurses capable of handling such cases,” said the doctor.
