BELAGAVI: A woman who is 7 months pregnant and quarantined in a hospital,went on a hunger strike, demanding the food of her choice.

The expecting mother, who is also suffering from thyroid, barely ate on Sunday and Monday. “I lived on water and a packet of biscuits,” said the woman. 

As she is a vegetarian, she refused to eat eggs served to her at the Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS). The woman was quarantined at the hospital on May 13. “In the initial days, when I said I do not eat eggs, the authorities simply removed the egg from the food packet and served me. This did not go down well with me since I developed a repulsion towards the food. Patients here are served food thrice a day,” she said.

Hence on Sunday and Monday, the woman decided to go on a hunger strike. However, she drank water and ate biscuits. This got her family worried, prompting them to call up the hospital authorities. 

After that, better food was served on Tuesday. Although, they do not serve me egg now, the rotis, dal and rice served are of a poor quality. “The dal and rice are salty, and I am worried about my heath, as I have blood pressure issues.” 

The woman added that she is pregnant, but so far no fruits or juices were provided to her, despite her demanding the same. The woman, who has spent over 15 days in the hospital, may again go on a hunger strike. The woman also said that only ward boys and nurses visit every day, and doctors rarely come and check on her. The woman is asymptomatic of Covid-19. 

BIMS director Vinay Dastikop said no non-vegetarian food is served at the hospital. The woman had demanded vegetarian food and the hospital is meeting the demand. “We are also serving dry fruits to the woman. Government hospitals have their limitations, and we are doing our best with our limited resources.”
