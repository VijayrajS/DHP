PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday urged the Centre to suspend the operation of all Bihar-bound flights for some days in the wake of Covid-19. Nitish spoke to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri over phone in this regard in order to check further spread of coronavirus in the region, an official at chief minister’s office (CMO) told TOI. Bihar has two operating airports at Patna and Gaya. 


Nitish also thanked the Centre for accepting his request to suspend the operation of all passenger trains and interstate buses from Sunday. “I had made a request to the Centre for suspending operation of passenger trains and interstate-buses in the wake of Covid-19,” Nitish said in a press note issued on Sunday.

The CM expressed grief over a person’s death due to coronavirus in Bihar and ordered payment of prescribed financial assistance (Rs4 lakh) to the next of kin of the victim from the CM Relief Fund.
