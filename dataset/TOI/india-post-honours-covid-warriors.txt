India Post honours Covid warriors
2020-04-23
PANAJI: In a tribute to the frontline warriors fighting the coronavirus pandemic, India Post has launched a special cover to honour their contribution.

“India Post thanks them for their relentless efforts in fighting the war against Covid-19 and salutes them for their selfless service to the nation,” the cover reads. The back of the cover also reads that the pandemic has stalled normal life across the world but has given birth to a new battalion of warriors who are “at the forefront risking their lives.”

Limited copies of the cover have been printed by the Kerala Post Circle to commemorate the heroes. “The special cover was released by the Kerala postal circle and may come later to the other philatelic bureaus since they have not printed plenty to be supplied pan-India,” said postmaster general, N Vinodkumar.
