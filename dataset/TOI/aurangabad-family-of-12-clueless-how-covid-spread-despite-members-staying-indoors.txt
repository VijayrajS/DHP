AURANGABAD: A day after getting discharged from the hospital, 12 members of a family, all of whom were infected by Covid-19, said on Thursday that they had no clue how did the infection spread among them despite staying indoors ever since the lockdown was imposed two months ago. 


“Since lockdown, all the family members were strictly confined to home. Our only contact with the outside world was for procuring essentials. My mother used to go out for getting ration and milk. She was the first positive patient in our family,” said the eldest of the four brothers in the family. 

The woman (70) was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and succumbed to the infection on May 21.

Family members said there was no confirmed case of Covid-19 either from the area. “While the infection spread from my mother to all other family members, we are still wondering how she contracted the disease in the first place. How my mother got infected by Covid-19 is still a mystery for us,” said the elder son.

Apart from the woman, the others who got infected from the Bahadurpura family included her husband, their three sons, three daughter-in-laws and five grandchildren. All of them have been discharged from the hospital. One of the four daughters of the elderly couple living at Phulambri and her daughter have also tested positive for Covid 19 and are now in hospital.

“My mother was admitted to GMCH while other family members were put in either at the district civil hospital or MGM hospital. Except my mother, all other members knew that the infection has struck the entire family. We kept in touch with each other over phone. We never forget our days in the hospitals when we prayed for the well being of our family members,” said another member of the family.
