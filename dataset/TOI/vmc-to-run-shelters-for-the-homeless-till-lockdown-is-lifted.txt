2020-04-24
VIJAYAWADA: Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Thursday said it will continue shelters for the homeless and the destitute till the lockdown is withdrawn completely.


VMC estate wing has accommodated 1,836 persons in the 17 shelters in the city. It has served around 1.10 lakh meals in the last one month during the lockdown.

Special relief camps for the homeless are continuing since the first day of the lockdown at CVR High school Governorpet, Sundaramma High School One Town, Vehicle Depot, Andhra Loyola College, Kandukuri Function hall, VR Siddhartha College and other locations in the city by VMC.

VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh has kept special focus on these shelters and has provided necessary essentials to the people in them. Special medical camps were organised in these shelters so that people get treatment. St Ann’s Hospital monitored the health camps.

Vijayawada Jain Samaj, Seva Bharati and other voluntary organisations are playing a key role in providing essentials and food for the people at the shelters. The VMC estate wing has provided soaps, towels, bedsheets, pillows, lungis, toothpaste and other items to the inmates with the support of donors.

“We are working with a motive that no homeless person suffers during the lockdown. Our teams worked hard to identify the homeless and shift them to the shelters. We have arranged a control room for supervising the arrangements at these shelters. We are ensuring that no inmate from the shelter goes out. The support of donors has helped us to run these shelters for one month. We will continue these shelters till the lockdown is lifted,” said VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh.
