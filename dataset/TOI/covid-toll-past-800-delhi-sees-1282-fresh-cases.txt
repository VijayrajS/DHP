NEW DELHI: The death toll due to Covid-19 in Delhi crossed 800 mark to reach 812 with 51 more persons being declared dead due to the infection on Sunday. Of the total deaths, data shows, 339 (45%) fatalities have been confirmed in the last one week alone, between June 1 and 7.


Officials said some of the deaths took place earlier, but they were added into the list of fatalities caused by Covid-19 following due perusal of case summaries by the death audit committee.

The number of coronavirus cases in the national capital rose to 28,936 with 1,282 fresh infections, according to the health bulletin issued by Delhi government. There are 17,125 active cases, while 10,999 people have either been cured or discharged or have migrated, the bulletin said.

On Saturday, Delhi recorded 1,320 fresh coronavirus cases taking the Covid-19 tally in the city to more than 27,500, while the death toll due to the disease mounted to 761. The highest single-day spike in fresh cases—1,513—was recorded on June 3.

After Maharashtra, Delhi has maximum active cases of Covid-19. The spike in active cases in the national capital, officials said, has been caused due to sudden increase in new cases.

Delhi’s daily count of Covid-19 crossed the 1,000 mark for the first time on May 28 when 1,024 new cases were reported. Since then, the numbers have been going up daily, except on June 1 when only 990 new cases were reported.

Epidemiologists say the chances of cases coming down anytime soon are unlikely because the infection is spreading. “We need to be prepared to deal with more patients by arranging more hospital beds, in government as well as private facilities,” said a senior doctor.

To deal with the critically ill, the government has directed state-run hospitals to upgrade their facilities in three weeks. It will include adding more ventilator beds, beds equipped with oxygen support and recovery or observation beds.
