Shivamogga: Twentyfour people—21 from Shivamogga and three from neighbouring districts—had attended the Tablighi congregation in Nizamuddin in Delhi and have been quarantined, said RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, he said there is no need to make a big issue over it. 

The restriction on sale of chicken meat and eggs due to bird flu has been relaxed on Friday, he added.

Milk is distributed free of cost to the families. The city has approved the sale of vegetables in 43 carts and approximately 30 vehicles have already been approved by the horticulture department to transport vegetables.
