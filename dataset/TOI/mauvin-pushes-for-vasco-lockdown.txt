Vasco: Panchayats minister and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho on Sunday appealed to chief minister Pramod Sawant to impose a total lockdown in Vasco to contain the spread of coronavirus from the Mangor Hill containment zone to other parts of Mormugao taluka and all over the state.

Godinho told reporters, “Considering the galloping number of cases linked to Mangor Hill, which are obviously impacting the entire Mormugao taluka, a lockdown is inevitable. The chief minister has to immediately take a step in this direction in order to ensure that the pandemic does not spread to other parts of the taluka and other parts of Goa.”

The Dabolim MLA said the disease can be contained and brought under control by taking precautionary and preventive measures, but first a total lockdown of the entire port town should be ordered with immediate effect.

“The people should also follow all the health measures and guidelines issued by the MHA and state health authorities by maintaining social distancing, wearing face masks and using sanitizers. It is the duty of the people to remain cautious and cooperate with the government,” Godinho said.

The state saw 33 new cases on Sunday of which 30 were linked to Mangor Hill .
