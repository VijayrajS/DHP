He tested positive on April 13 when the results came and was admitted in the isolation ward of PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research. Forty policemen attached to Thudiyalur police station were also screened for Covid-19 since the man had visited the station after his return from Delhi. A Murali, professor of medicine and specialist, infectious diseases of PSG hospitals, issued a certificate stating that the second throat swab RTPCR was negative. This was issued on the request of the man’s son, the hospital said.``Yet, the patient is retained in the hospital.
