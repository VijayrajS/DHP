Covid-19 lockdown: Competitions on WhatsApp to keep Prayagraj cops' kids busy
2020-04-09
Prayagraj: At a time when around 5,000 policemen in the district are unable to spare time for their families as they remain busy with their duties during the lockdown, wives of senior police have started an online competition to engage children in activities like singing, drawing and story writing.


Currently, over 200 families are a part of the WhatsApp group where the activities are announced and winners are adjudged. The participants have to send photographs of their creations on the group.

These competitions are being organised under the banner of Vaama Sarthi (UP Police Family Welfare Association). District president of Vaama Sarthi Raji Satyarth said, “We have created a WhatsApp group ‘Udaan – Kalpana Ki’ to keep children of police families engaged during the lockdown.”

She said the exercise would help children to explore their talent and realise their calibre.
