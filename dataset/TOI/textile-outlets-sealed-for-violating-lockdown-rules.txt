Coimbatore: The district administration and revenue officials on Sunday sealed four textile outlets on Crosscut Road in Gandhipuram for violating lockdown norms.Of them, three were air-conditioned textile outlets with more than one floor. Another non-air-conditioned outlet was also sealed in the same area, as it failed to ensure social distancing among the customers .The district administration had allowed small commercial establishments to open on May 11. However, malls, commercial complexes, big jewelleries and textile shops that were air-conditioned were not allowed to function.A revenue official, who didn’t want to be named, said some big, air-conditioned shops had been functioning against the rules. “We got information that some shops on Crosscut Road were functioning and we conducted a raid. We sealed three big textile outlets with more than one floor. They were air-conditioned. The shops also didn’t ensure adherence to safety measures such as personal distancing by the customers. One of the shops has been carrying out business through the back door, while keeping the front shutter downed.” Pointing out that the fourth textile outlet that was sealed was a non-air-conditioned one, the official said the outlet had failed to ensure personal distancing among the customers. “We would report the issue to the district collector and police officials and ensure that they will be brought to justice.” Officials also conducted raids at Mettupalayam and sealed two air-conditioned textile outlets that were functioning against rules. “We have taken up the issue with police and lodged cases against them,” the official said.
