PATNA: Police have so far realised Rs 23.35 crore as fine under Motor Vehicles Act from those violating lockdown norms since the last week of March.

Altogether 2,471 people were arrested, 2,275 FIRs lodged and 96,677 vehicles seized till Sunday for violation of lockdown norms.

According to state police headquarters, Rs 3.11 crore was realised as fine from lockdown violators since June 1, when ‘Unlock 1.0’ was introduced by the government. Altogether 39 people were arrested, 19 FIRs lodged and 12,028 vehicles seized during this period.

During the complete lockdown phase which existed till May 31, police had collected Rs 20.23 crore as fine, arrested 2,432 people, lodged 2,256 FIRs and seized 84,649 vehicles across the state.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said the fines were imposed under Motor Vehicles Act. “Arrests were made under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, National Disaster Management Act and Bihar Epidemic Disease Act,” he said.

The SSP said the government is also considering introduction of penal provision for not wearing mask in public places. “Once such penal provision is introduced by the state government, action will be taken against people not wearing mask in public places,” he added.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said fines were imposed under MV Act during the lockdown period just to discourage people from coming out of their homes unnecessarily. “The fine amounts have been deposited in a government bank account,” he added.
