AGRA: Barely hours after Mathura DM ordered registration of an FIR against 13 staffers of Government District Combined Hospital, who fled from a quarantine centre, all of them including five nurses and three ward boys resurfaced at the same hospital, on Friday morning.


Notwithstanding their return to the district combined hospital, they all were booked by the local police under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC at Vrindavan police station. This was confirmed by station house officer, Sanjeev Dubey.

These staffers had fled from Krishna Kuteer quarantine centre, where they had been shifted after one of the district combined hospitalâ€™s ward boy tested positive for coronavirus on April 28. Officials said now they were not ready to go back to the quarantine centre and were insisting on staying at the district hospital only.

Earlier, 13 doctors, who came in contact with the infected ward boy, had also refused to shift at the quarantine centre and quarantined themselves in the hospital itself. Health officials said that most of the doctors are not ready to give samples for Covid-19 test and only 20 samples from health workers had been collected till Friday.

Meanwhile, 10 more people tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, taking the total tally to 25 in the district. Among the 10 patients, an elderly couple also tested positive for the infection. The couple are the parents of a boy, who had earlier tested positive.
