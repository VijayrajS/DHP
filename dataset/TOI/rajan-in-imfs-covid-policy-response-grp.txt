MUMBAI: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan has been inducted into IMF MD’s special advisory board for policy responses to Covid-19-induced challenges. 


On Friday evening, an IMF release said Rajan, currently a professor at University of Chicago, was one of the 12 members of the eminent group from around the world that “draws on high-level policy, market and private sector experience to provide insights to enhance the Fund’s ability to serve its membership.” Earlier, between October 2003 and December 2006, Rajan was IMF’s chief economist.

Along with Rajan, there’s Mohamed A El-Erian on the panel. El-Erian, also a former IMF top official and a globally acknowledged debt market guru, is now the chief economic adviser to Allianz group of Germany. Other members include Tharman Shanmugaratnam, senior minister of Singapore and the chief of the Monetary Authority of Singapore; Kristin Forbes, a professor at MIT; Kevin Rudd, former PM of Australia; Carmen Reinhart, a professor at Harvard University and Mark Malloch Brown, former UN Deputy Secretary-General.

“To serve our membership well in this context, we need top-notch input and expertise from the widest range of sources, inside and outside the Fund. “Toward this end…an exceptional and diverse group of eminent individuals with high-level policy, market, and private sector experience has agreed to serve on my external advisory group,” Kristalina Georgieva, MD, IMF was quoted in the release.
