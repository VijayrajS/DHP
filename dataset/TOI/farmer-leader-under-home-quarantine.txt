Rajkot: Kisan Congress leader Pal Ambaliya has been placed under home quarantine at his residence in Hanjadapar village of Khambhalia taluka in Devbhoomi Dwarka district ever since he lodged a complaint against cops for the alleged custodial torture on May 24. “To put me under quarantine is a conspiracy by the state government to restrict my movements to continue with the agitation for farmers,” alleged Ambaliya. Ambaliya also wrote a letter to director general of police on Thursday, demanding registration of his complaint against the cops for the alleged torture. In his letter, Ambaliya alleged that assistant commissioner of police J H Sarvaiya, inspector H M Gadhvi and the cops of Rajkot crime branch whipped him with sticks on the night of May 24. “I have sought a hearing through video conferencing with the DGP,” said Ambalia. “After subjecting me to police brutality, both ACP Sarvaiya and PI Gadhvi threatened to finish me off in an encounter, if I came to Rajkot again,” he said. On May 24, Ambaliya was arrested for holding a protest at the collectorate. “I wanted to register my protest against the wholesale traders’ decision to reduce the prices of onions and cotton produce,” he said. Ambaliya alleged that after his release from the Pradyumannagar police station, he was called to the police station again under the pretext of taking his finger prints. Then he was taken to the crime branch office where he was allegedly thrashed.
