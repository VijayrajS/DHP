Final year students worried about future as lockdown extends
2020-05-06
MADURAI: With the exams and results set to be delayed, final year students of various courses across all colleges in the district are anxious about their future since uncertainties loom over job vacancies and admissions for higher studies.

“This year exams and results are both invariably delayed. Further, amid this uncertainty, we are unable to focus properly on studies as well,” said K Chakravarthi, a final year BSc student.

C Priya, a final year UG Visual Communication student said, “By this time, I was supposed to be trying to get an internship to work with a studio utilizing the break after exams. Job was going to be my priority but now considering less job opportunities, I am also open to pursuing masters.”

Students who wanted to go for higher studies in premier institutes across the country and abroad are also finding it difficult to stick to their plans. “The problem is that considering the situation parents and students are both uncertain about how it would be to travel to another state or country. There will always be this fear even when exams are over,” said an assistant professor at an arts college. He added that career counselling is hence much-needed for students once exams are over.

Several engineering students wanting to study masters abroad are also equally in distress as they are set to begin their course by September but their visas are getting cancelled. Joining jobs after getting placed also remains uncertain, said engineering students.
