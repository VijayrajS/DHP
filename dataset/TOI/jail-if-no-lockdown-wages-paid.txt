GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat’s labour & employment department has stated in a government resolution that employers who do not pay wages to workers during the lockdown can be jailed up to one year under the Disaster Management Act.


Vipul Mitra, the additional chief secretary (ACS), labour & employment said, “Directions have already been issued to all collectors and labour officers to strictly ensure that workers and labourers get full wages even during the lockdown period.” He added, “The violation of Section 34 of the Disaster Management Act is punishable under Section 51 of the Act with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to one year, or with fine, or both.”

Mitra further said that the labour department has issued advisories over the past few days, directing employers not to lay off any employees or workers because of the lockdown. He added that employers have been directed not to reduce wages during this period. “In case any worker takes leave, he/she should be deemed to be on duty without any deduction in wages till 15-04-20,” Mitra said.

The official said that another advisory says unorganized sector workers will be deemed to be on duty without any deduction in wages till April 14.
