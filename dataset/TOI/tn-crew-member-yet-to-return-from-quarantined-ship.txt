2020-02-29
MADURAI: Of the five crew members from Tamil Nadu who were on board COVID-19 quarantined ship Diamond Princess at Yokohama in Japan for more than three weeks only four have returned to India. Anbalagan, a crew member from Madurai who is among the Indians in a quarantine camp in Haryana, told TOI that a crew member from Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district was not in his camp.

The 138 Indians on board the ship included five from Tamil Nadu – one each from Madurai, Tuticorin, Trichy, Coimbatore and Chengalpattu districts. According to the Indian embassy in Japan, 16 of them tested positive for COVID-19 over a period of time and were taken to off shore quarantine facilities.

On Wednesday evening, 119 Indian crew members who tested negative for COVID-19 were taken from the ship at Yokohama to the airport by bus and flown to Delhi. On reaching India on Thursday morning, they were then taken to the defence camp for a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

“We all assumed that all the Indian crew members, including the five Tamil Nadu crew, have returned. I could not find the crew member from Kovilpatti in the camp. I was told by fellow crew members that he had tested positive for COVID-19,” Anbalagan said on Friday night.

He said the missing member joined work in the ship only a month ago due to which others were not close to him. “It is not confirmed if he is affected. But we could not find him here,” he added, expressing the hope he would be back home soon.
