Power demand goes up during lockdown in Andhra Pradesh
2020-03-26
AMARAVATI: The state-wide lockdown has seen domestic power demand going up in the last few days. Power utilities are struggling to keep the supply uninterrupted despite sudden spike in consumption.


According to sources, domestic consumption has almost doubled in the last few days. Authorities are worried that the supply system might trip if consumption levels go up any further. 

Although all commercial establishments had remained closed since Sunday, there was no proportionate fall in overall power consumption. The officials suspect that steep rise in domestic consumption has evaporated savings of commercial establishments. 

Although there are no issues on the generation side, managing sudden overload on supply lines would pose a big threat to the entire system, a senior official of CPDCL said.
