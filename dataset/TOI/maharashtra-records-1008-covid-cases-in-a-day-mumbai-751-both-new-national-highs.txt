MUMBAI: A day after breaching the 10,000 mark, Maharashtra added 1,008 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day addition so far for it and for any other state in the country and the first-ever four-digit rise in the state’s 24-hour count since the outbreak began in March.


Mumbai continued to be the biggest contributor with 751 cases, its highest singleday addition as well. Mumbai, in fact, contributed to 74% of the total cases in Friday. The total tally of cases for the state now is 11,506 and for the city is 7,812.

The previous highest addition of new cases for the state and the city had been recorded on April 25, with 811 cases in Maharashtra, of which 602 were from Mumbai.

Of the 751 fresh cases in Mumbai, the BMC said 399 or 53% of cases were from tests conducted between April 25 and 28 in various private laboratories. “On Friday, we received laboratory reports accumulated over the last four days and added it to the tally,” said a BMC health official. The state chief secretary had earlier in the week directed private laboratories to issue test reports within 24 hours of collecting samples.
