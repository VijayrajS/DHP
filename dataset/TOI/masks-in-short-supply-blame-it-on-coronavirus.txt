Masks in short supply in Delhi: Blame it on coronavirus
2020-02-25
NEW DELHI: With China hit by coronavirus outbreak and supply being stalled from the neighbouring nation, city pharmacy stores are facing shortage of masks.


At present, only locally manufactured products are available. “There aren’t enough masks available in the market. If you want to buy, you can or leave it,” shopkeepers have been telling customers who are protesting the high prices.

The surgical masks that are usually sold for Rs 10 in retail market are currently being sold at Rs 40. The N95 masks, which has multiple layers for better protection and re-use, are being sold anywhere between Rs 150 and Rs 500.

“We are also paying extra to purchase the masks from suppliers,” said a shopkeeper, justifying the increased price.

Vivek Tiwari, founder and CEO, Medikabazaar, said they have witnessed 10 times growth in demand for face masks, particulate respiratory masks, protective suits, sterile surgical gloves and safety goggles. “In the last few weeks, we have received multiple queries from China, Japan, Singapore, and even India and other countries and we have increased our procurement of masks and other items many folds to meet the demand,” he said.

Every time a patient coughs or sneezes, the droplets containing the virus are released and they tend to spread. Masks are advised for people visiting crowded areas such as hospitals or airports.

“I was travelling to Lucknow to attend a family function with parents. So I thought of buying the masks. Some of the pharmacy stores said they didn’t have any, while others were selling at inflated rates. If this is the situation now, I wonder what will happen if the infection spreads in the country and there is actual need for more masks,” Ashish Goyal, a resident of Noida said.

Delhi has not reported any positive case of coronavirus.
