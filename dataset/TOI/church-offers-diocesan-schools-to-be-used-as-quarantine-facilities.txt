Panaji: The archdiocese of Goa and Daman has offered its educational institutions to set up quarantine facilities for stranded Goans returning from overseas. In a letter to CM Pramod Sawant, archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao highlighted the fact that Goans are working in distant lands and seas for the sake of their livelihoods, and they dispatch their savings to families back in Goa, thus supporting the state economy. The state is the primary custodian of the rights of citizens and shouldact with urgency to evacuate Goans stranded abroad, considering the growing anxiety of their families in Goa.
