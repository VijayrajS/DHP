Karur: The selfless gesture shown by a group of artists in the district to create awareness among people on novel coronavirus was recognised by the district administration which not just gave permission to paint at three major locations in Karur town but also decided to pay them for their service. The artists have drawn a 40-feet wide colourful painting on the road at the light house corner junction, as it is an entry point to Karur town, to attract the attention of people on the ill-effects of Covid-19. Similarly, a giant painting was raised near the collector’s office while another will come up near Karur bus stand. V Raju, 60, president of Karur District Painters’ Association, said they met the district collector on Saturday for permission to create giant awareness paintings on roads on Covid-19. “Though we told him that we only needed permission, collector T Anbalagan was kind enough bear the cost incurred in the process.” Raju said that their depiction of coronavirus will have a lasting impact on people and compel them to follow directions from the administration. On the plight of painters, he said, “unlike in the past when there were over a 100-members in the association, it has now come down to less than 50.” Raju currently works as drawing teacher in a private school in Karur. A senior official from the district administration said they will be engaging them in painting works for the district administration as and when there will be any requirement.
