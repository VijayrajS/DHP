HYDERABAD: Authorities are awaiting test results of four migrant workers from Bihar, tenants of a 55-year-old grocery store owner from Chegur who died of Covid-19 at Osmania General Hospital on April 1. 


On March 8, the four construction workers in their mid twenties, went to Uttarakhand and returned to Hyderabad on March 19. On March 18, they had boarded Sampark Kranti train in Nizamuddin (Delhi) and reached Kachiguda on March 19.

“As per our information, some people who attended Nizamuddin Markaz had also travelled by the same train. We suspect that the workers might have been infected during the journey and through them coronavirus could have spread to the grocer,” police said.

The woman, who runs the grocery store in Chegur village with 675 households and 2,500 population, fell ill and she was treated at private hospitals in Shadnagar and subsequently in Mahbubnagar on March 31. On April 1, while undergoing treatment at Osmania General Hospital (OGH), she succumbed. After the death, she tested positive for Covid-19. 

On April 2, her body was cremated and authorities shortlisted 34 persons, including her husband, four children, seven close relatives who were part of the funeral procession. Also, two villagers, two registered medical practitioners (RMPs) from Chegur and Shadnagar, the four tenants and two other men from Chegur who picked up the four migrant workers from Kachiguda railway station and brought them to Chegur in a car were also shortlisted. 

“We have sent the samples of the four migrants for testing. Results are awaited,” Rangareddy collector Amoy Kumar said. All the 34 members, who were direct contacts of the woman, have been placed under institutional quarantine. “We have cordoned off Chegur village as a precautionary measure,” Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar said.
