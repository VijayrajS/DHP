2020-03-15
PANAJI: Two suspects a Russian and an Indian were admitted to the isolation ward at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, on Saturday, while a Goan who worked on a ship that travelled to Italy last month, has tested negative for Covid-19. 


A health department official said the laboratory report of the Goan suspect has come negative while reports of the other two are awaited.

Since samples are sent to a laboratory in Nagpur, it will be a day or two before the status of the Russian and Indian suspects is known.

The official said the Russian was staying in Candolim while the Indian had recently returned from Kerala. “Both showed symptoms of Covid-19 and were isolated,” he said.

While no person has tested positive for Covid-19 in Goa till Saturday, as many as 55 with travel history have been placed under home quarantine.

Goa has stepped up efforts after a spike in cases was detected in neighbouring states. It has posted eight doctors at Dabolim International Airport and also a paramedic.

GMC has scheduled a training session on Covid-19 for all doctors, healthcare workers and staff of the hospital during the next few days.
