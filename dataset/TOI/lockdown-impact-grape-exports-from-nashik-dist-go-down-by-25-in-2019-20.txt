NASHIK: The export of grapes took a major hit due to the lockdown, registering a 25% decline during the 2019-2020 season — December to April.

During the 2018-19 grape season, the district exported around 1.44 lakh tonne of grapes (an all-time high), but the figure dropped to 1.09 lakh tonne in the last season. 

According to sources in the state agriculture department, of the 1.09 lakh tonne, 80,433 tonne was exported to European countries, while remaining 29,454 tonne was exported to non-European countries.

“Grape farmers did not receive containers and also faced scarcity of workers for harvesting. This has led to drop in grape export,” M Patil, senior member of Maharashtra state grape growers association, said.

In 2017-18 grape season, the export from the district had declined by 22% to 1.02 lakh tonne against 1.31 lakh tonne during the 2016-17 season. The drop in yield due to climatic conditions had badly-affected the grape production that year.

Of the total 3.5 lakh acre under grape plantation in Maharashtra, 2 lakh acre is in Nashik district. As per guidelines issued by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), it is mandatory for the grape exporters to register their vineyards.

Accordingly, around 28,500 farmers had registered their vineyards on a total of 18,000 hectare for 2019-20. In 2018-19, 38,400 grape farmers had registered their vineyards on 24,575 hectare across the district.
