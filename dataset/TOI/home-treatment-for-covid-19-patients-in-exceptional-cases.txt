Home treatment for Covid-19 patients in exceptional cases
2020-05-15
AURANGABAD: According to the guidelines of Government of India’s ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), very mild or pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients can be placed in home isolation for 17 days and can discontinue home isolation without needing to undergo test again. 

However, only those with requisite facility at home can be considered for home isolation.

Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) municipal officer of health Nita Padalkar said that as of now, Aurangabad has adequate facilities for Covid-19 patients, but in exceptional cases, home isolation can be allowed after assessment. Currently, the health authorities have started following a protocol issued by the state government under which Covid-19 cases are discharged after 10 days of institutional isolation without another test if they are asymptomatic. 

The number of Covid-19 cases in Aurangabad crossed 750 on Thursday. Of these, close to 500 are under treatment at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), district civil hospital, private hospitals and at AMC’s Covid Care Centers. However, if cases continue to rise steadily, these facilities will become inadequate. In such cases, the authorities may consider home isolation. However, the district administration has said that the facilities are sufficiently equipped for Covid-19 cases as of now.

According to guidelines for home isolation by MoHFW, a caregiver should be available to provide care on 24*7 basis and should be in constant touch with the hospital. The caregiver and all close contacts should be given hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis as per protocol and the patient should give an written undertaking agreeing to the conditions of home isolation. The guidelines also state that if the patient develops any Covid-19 symptoms, immediate medical attention should be sought.
