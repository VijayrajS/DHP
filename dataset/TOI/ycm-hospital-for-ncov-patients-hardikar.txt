PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar on Wednesday said the civic body-run Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital had been reserved for treating Covid-19 patients and citizens should visit DY Patil Hospital for treatment of other diseases and surgeries. 


Hardikar said this while answering the citizens’ questions during the second day of his five-day Facebook live session organized to create awareness about Covid-19. 

"It is impossible for people to go out from places where they are stranded. If one has to go out in an urgent situation in personal vehicle, one should take prior permission from police,” he said, appealing to people to go out only if it was necessary or to buy essentials. 

Hardikar said people should be careful while giving or taking food from neighbours and using public toilets. He added that the civic body was disinfecting hospitals and places, where positive patients have been found, with sodium hypochlorite. 

The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation was also conducting a risk analysis of the industrial sectors that could be allowed to open after the lockdown exit, the civic chief said.
