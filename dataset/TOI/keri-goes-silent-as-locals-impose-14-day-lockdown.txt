VALPOI/KERI: Alarmed over reports of Covid-19 cases in Sattari taluka, Keri residents have voluntarily imposed a 14-day lockdown in the village beginning from Monday.


In Shiroli-Keri where Covid-19 cases have been detected, villagers have decided to observe a 14-day lockdown. Some cases have been found in Morle, too.

Keri sarpanch Govind Gawas said the villagers have decided to self-isolate, even going to the extent of closing shops. 

In view of the lockdown, villagers have stocked up on essential supplies. “As Covid positive cases have been detected in neighbouring Morle and Guleli villages, Keri locals as well as the panchayat have unanimously decided for a lockdown,” Gawas said.

Panchayat member Laxman Gawas told TOI that the villagers have decided not to allow vehicles passing along the Goa-Karnataka highway to halt in Keri.

Devendra Gawas, a resident, said that government staff working in the health and police departments will continue with their duties. However, those employed in the private sector have decided not to attend till Thursday, he said. “Only banks and medical stores are functioning in the village,” he said.

Health officials visited Keri and Morle on Monday and took necessary precautionary measures.
