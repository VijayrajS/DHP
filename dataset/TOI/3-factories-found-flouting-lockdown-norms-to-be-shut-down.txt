Rudrapur: Shutdown notices are being served on three industries whose owners were booked for flouting lockdown norms, according to district police officials. Udham Singh Nagar’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Barinderjit Singh said on Thursday that the three factories include two rice mills in Sitarganj and a seed plant in Rudrapur.

Talking to TOI, SSP Singh said , “When a team of city police was patrolling the Lamba Bagad area on Gadarpur road on Wednesday, they found three migrant labourers working in the Hemkund seed plant, where social distancing protocols were also not practised. The owner of the seed plant and the contractor who supplied these labourers were booked under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and the Disaster Management Act, section 51.”

Similarly, Sitarganj police, after being tipped-off, raided Shanti rice mill and Shivshakti rice mill, where two and four labourers from Uttar Pradesh, respectively, were found working and that too without any permission.

“The owners and the labour supplier were also booked under the same sections,” added Singh.

The police official said that during interrogation conducted by them, it was found that these labourers had come to the border on bikes and made their way to these establishments through fields and farms, dodging the police.”

“ The labourers were sent to the police stations of their respective hometowns to be quarantined. “We are now taking strict actions against these industries and will be issuing them shutdown notices. The district magistrate has given his consent for the same and they will be served notices in a couple of days,” the cop added.
