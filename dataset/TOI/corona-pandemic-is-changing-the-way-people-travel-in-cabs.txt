Corona pandemic is changing the way people travel in cabs
2020-06-02
To ensure social distancing is maintained, cab aggregators released a list of guidelines for both cabbies and passengers last week. With cabs now plying on city roads, cabbies say they've been at the receiving end of extreme reactions – from passengers fighting to turn on the AC and some removing masks to receive calls, to those carrying sanitising sprays to disinfect the car.




Riders carry disinfecting sprays, plastic sheets and newspapers
Drivers are required to sanitise their car after each trip, before they can accept a new ride. However, passengers are extra careful, and are taking their own precautions. A cabbie says, "After each ride, I disinfect the cab for my own safety, too. But customers usually ask me to spray it again for their assurance. In fact, some passengers carry disinfecting sprays and disinfect the cab before they enter. Some keep spraying throughout the ride." Another cab driver shares, "Many passengers are carrying newspapers, plastic sheets and cushions to ensure they don’t come in direct contact with the cab's seats."
