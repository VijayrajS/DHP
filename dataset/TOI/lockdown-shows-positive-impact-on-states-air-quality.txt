Lockdown shows positive impact on Goa’s air quality
2020-05-05
PANAJI: Limited industrial activity and restricted vehicular movement during the lockdown has helped improve the state’s air quality. Chairman of the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), Ganesh Shetgaonkar said that not only air quality, but also visibility has been enhanced.


“Goa’s air quality index is now below 50, which means it is very good air quality,” Shetgaonkar told TOI. Before the lockdown, on an average day the state’s air quality index stood between 51 and 100, which is defined as moderate. 

The board monitors air quality at 12 locations in the state through air ambient quality monitoring stations. 

Even at MPT, where coal is handled, the air quality, which used to sometimes exceed 100, has improved to between 51 and 100, Shetgaonkar said. 

“Sometimes due to wind it (the index value) might exceed, but overall the air quality at MPT is satisfactory,” he said, adding that the decreased air pollution has increased visibility and he can now see Vasco from his office at Pilerne. 

During the lockdown there were no vehicles on roads, and all construction and industrial activities ceased. This meant there was no dust formation and it helped improve the air quality, Shetgaonkar said.

He added that it will take time to receive the finding of the source appropriation study at Vasco. The board has collected samples but is unable to analyse the data due to the lockdown, Shetgaonkar said. 

A source appropriation study is carried out to find the reason behind the air pollution in an area.

The state government has tasked the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mumbai, with examining the particulate matter pollution levels at Vasco through field sampling and air quality data analysis. 

IIT-Mumbai in its source appropriation report will indicate the exact quantity of coal, bauxite and other dust particles present in the air.
