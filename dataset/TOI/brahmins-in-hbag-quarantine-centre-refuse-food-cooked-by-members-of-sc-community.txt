Hazaribag: Five Brahmin migrants lodged at the Banaso quarantine centre in Hazaribag’s Bishnugarh block on Sunday refused to eat food cooked by members of a Scheduled Caste community. The district officials later decided to give the five dry ration and asked them to prepare their own food. Around 100 people, mostly migrants who returned from different states, have been kept at this quarantine centre.

Confirming the news, Hazaribag deputy commissioner Bhuvanesh Pratap Singh said, “They (migrants) should not have made such a hue and cry about the issue. One needs to rise above caste and religious affiliations to jointly fight the pandemic.”

Bishnugarh block development officer (BDO) Sanjay Kumar Kongari said, “After consultations with the local mukhiya, we gave them dry ration.”

In another development, a quarantine centre at Barwar Idgah School in Daroo block was vacated as inmates reportedly demanded a dedicated cook.

But the DC said the authorities have decided to vacate quarantine centres by releasing people who don’t have Covid-19 symptoms. He said, “There is no point keeping migrants who don’t exhibit Covid-19 symptoms in quarantine centres. We need the space to accommodate the migrants who are in the process of returning soon.”
