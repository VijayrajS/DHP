JAIPUR: A 40-year-old woman was gangraped allegedly by three youths in Sawai Madhopur’s Batoda police station area on Thursday night following which she registered a case on Friday morning and cops arrested the three accused.


The woman, in her statement, said she has been stuck for a month in Sawai Madhopur due to the lockdown. She decided to walk down to her residence in Jaipur.

Seetaram Meena, SHO, Batoda police station, said, “The woman lived in a rented accommodation in Jaipur and was trying to reach there. However, she somehow lost her way and found herself in a village in our police station area.”

According to officials, they asked the local administration to ensure that the woman is provided boarding and lodging for the night following which she was housed in a government school.

“The woman was kept in a government school alone by the villagers despite the fact that the local officials asked them not to as the school was vacant. However, the villagers were worried that she might be carrying the coronavirus because of which they wanted to keep her isolated. Sometime during the night, the three accused, who are locals, raped her,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

The rape survivor’s medical was done and the three accused remanded in judicial custody. “The accused were arrested the same day when she registered the complaint and they all are in their mid to late 20s. They probably found that the woman had been provided shelter at the school and they decided to sexually assault her. Her statement has been recorded and investigation is under way,” said a police official. The woman has been kept in a quarantine centre and her samples have been taken to test for coronavirus though the report is awaited.
