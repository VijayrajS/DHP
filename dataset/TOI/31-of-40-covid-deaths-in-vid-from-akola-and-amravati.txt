Three of them were of patients undergoing treatment at the isolation ward. All three patients were having severe comorbidities. Age factor was also important in it,” said divisional deputy director of health services, Akola, Dr Riyaz Faruqui.According to sources, there has been unusual surge in death records of Akola Municipal Corporation.
