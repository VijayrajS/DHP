Ahmedabad: ASI Girish Barot, 57, resident of Saraspur, died of Covid-19 on Sunday morning at SGVP hospital. Barot is the third policeman in the city to die of Covid-19. 

A guard of honour was given to Barot by police personnel and officials of the jurisdiction and he was cremated in Krishnanagar.


DCP, Zone-4, Neeraj Badgujar said that as a decision was taken not to put policemen above the age of 55 in the field for implementation of lockdown, Barot had been shifted to duty at the police station from his earlier posting in PCR van patrolling.

“On May 20 he developed some complications and was sent home, although he wanted to continue work. Later he was diagnosed as Covid-19 Positive and admitted to SGVP hospital. He died on Sunday morning and was cremated with full honours,” said Badgujar.

Currently, there are about 84 active cases of Covid-19 in the police and other forces deployed in the city. “Of them, 62 are from police and the rest 22 are from other forces. About 251 police officers and personnel have been discharged after recovery from Covid-19,” a police officer said.
