She came across an online ad for Bhakti Enterprises in Bhubaneswar, and contacted its proprietor, Bodle. She asked for pictures of the mask, and the company's GST number and ISO certification. She finalised a deal for 1.6 lakh masks at Rs 14.4 lakh, and paid Rs 4 lakh as advance. 

Monacha's accountant checked the GST number and ISO certificate, and found it to be fake. Monacha also found that the company address Bodle had given her was bogus. She then approached the police.
