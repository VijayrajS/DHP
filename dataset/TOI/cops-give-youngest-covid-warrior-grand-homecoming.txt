Delhi: Cops give youngest Covid warrior grand homecoming
2020-05-15
NEW DELHI: When constable Devender Singh, who was on duty in the hotspot zone of Jahangirpuri, tested Covid-positive on April 22, his biggest worry was his nine-month pregnant wife who also got infected with the virus.


On May 8, the couple was blessed with a baby girl. Not just Singh and his wife, but even officers in the district were worried about the child. As luck would have it, the baby tested negative. As soon as the good news reached them, a special homecoming was arranged for the seven-day-old Covid warrior. Senior officers call her their youngest warrior now.

Singh told TOI, “When I tested positive, I was only worried about my wife, Neelam Rana, who was in the last days of her pregnancy. My fear came true when she tested positive and was admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital. Though I wanted to be around her, I couldn’t. All I could think of was my baby.”

The couple would constantly chat on the phone or video call, but their anxiety increased with each passing day.

Rana, on the other hand, didn’t have any symptoms despite testing positive. “When I entered the Covid ward, I was scared to stay with the other patients. I was later shifted to a room owing to my pregnancy. Each passing day was tough as I was worried for my child. She was born on May 8 in the morning. I couldn’t even see her. She was discharged on May 11 and I a day later,” said the mother.

On Thursday, DCP (Northwest) Vijayanta Arya arranged the special homecoming of the mother and the daughter. With pink balloons and cakes, a team of officers from Jahangirpuri reached the couple’s residence. When Singh’s five-year-old son heard the police siren, he quickly dressed up to welcome the officers.

“He wore a police uniform on his school annual day last year. Since then, whenever someone from the department comes, he likes to wear it,” Singh said.
