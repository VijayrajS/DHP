KOLKATA: Twelve Japanese students from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, who came to Jadavpur University on February 2, had to cut short their trip and return home on Monday night amid growing fears over the spread of coronavirus. They were here for a short-term course on Bengali language and culture.


One of the students, Hana Sato, said, “Our flights were scheduled on March 8, but it was cancelled because of a Covid-19 alert. We were very worried about the availability of flights. So we thought it would be best to leave as early as possible or it may get difficult to return. We are also worried for our families back home.” 

Associate professor of Bengali and course coordinator Rajyeswar Sinha said, “Some of them had fallen ill and one of them was also kept in isolation at ID Hospital, Beliaghata. The situation was getting worrisome. This prompted them to return as soon as possible.”

The students attended their last class on Monday where they sang ‘Ami Banglay gaan gai’ and the popular Rabindrasangeet ‘Orey grihobasi’. “It was a great to know about Bengali language and culture. We shall miss our friends here,” said another student Hiroto.

Another student Yuto Tsujide said he had even learnt to cook Bengali food such as luchi, machher jhol, payesh and, given a chance, he would visit Kolkata again. They bought saris and kurtas from Gariahat for their family and friends.

Sinha said, “It would have been great if they could completed the course, which was scheduled to end on Friday. They even learnt a few songs and dances that they were supposed to perform on Basanta Utsav.” 

Joint registrar of JU, Sanjay Gopal Sarkar, said, “The students informed me that they were leaving the course midway because of the Covid-19 alert. We wish them good health and a safe journey.”
