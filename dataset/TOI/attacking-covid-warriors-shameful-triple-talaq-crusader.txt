2020-04-19
DEHRADUN: Exhorting all sections of society to join hands in the fight against novel coronavirus, triple talaq crusader Shayara Bano said that “misbehaving with and attacking policemen and doctors on corona duty is a shameful act and a disgrace to society.”

Talking to TOI over phone from Kashipur, Bano said, “It is a disgrace to see that our corona warriors like policemen, doctors and paramedics are attacked. Such acts are unpardonable.” 

 Bano urged people to follow the health department’s guidelines. 

“Instances of people throwing stones and spitting on doctors and police on Covid duty are very unfortunate and condemnable,” she said. On the spread of infection among Tablighi Jamaat members, she said, “Jamaat members should come forward and seek medical facilities. Those living in the Covid-19 hotspots must also not hide their conditions at any cost.”
