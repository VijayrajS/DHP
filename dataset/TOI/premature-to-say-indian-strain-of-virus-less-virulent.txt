‘Premature to say Indian strain of virus less virulent’
2020-03-31
Hyderabad: Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) scientists have said it is “scientifically unsound and premature” to speculate that novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) India strain is less virulent than the ones creating havoc in China, Italy and other countries.

CCMB began sequencing the genome of the virus extracted from Hyderabad samples. The scientists hope to soon sequence Maharasthra and Rajasthan samples too.

Of the 2,077 novel coronavirus genomes that were sequenced across the world, available on Nextstrain, an open-source pathogen genome data, only two were from India, both from samples in Kerala. 

CCMB director Dr Rakesh Mishra told TOI that sequencing of at least 50 genomes of the virus should be done from samples from various states to understand the strain better and know the rate of mutation and genetic similarities with the one in , China. 

“We have received ICMR kits and samples from Gandhi Hospital. While we do diagnostic tests for confirmation of corona positive patients, we will be sequencing the genome of the virus. So far, only two samples from Kerala were sequenced nationally. The virus is variable, and there is a need for more sequencing to understand the biology of the virus and the rate of mutation,” the CCMB chief said.

“We should have at least 50 to 100 genome sequences to understand the virus better,”he added. Reacting to comments of a few doctors that the Indian strain was less virulent, he said: “It is premature and scientifically unsound to comment on the virulence of the strain based on scanty data. There is too much of speculation.”

Pavitra Roychoudhury, acting instructor at the University of Washington, tweeted on Sunday, “There are only two full SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, both from Kerala. Unless there are additional data that hasn’t been published. I am not sure how one can say anything about the strains circulating locally (sic).”
