2020-04-20
HYDERABAD: Telangana on Sunday became the first state in India to extend the lockdown beyond May 3 with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao making a declaration to this effect at a press conference even as three Covid-19 deaths were reported from the state in the last 24 hours.


The chief minister also appealed to passengers not to plan air travel to Telangana till May 7. “They may plan to come from May 4. There will be no taxi or hotel open in Telangana. We will also tell GMR Airport authorities not to allow any passenger flights to Hyderabad up to May 7,” he said.

Ruling out any partial relaxation from April 20 which was announced by the Centre for areas which are not severely affected by coronavirus in a state, KCR said the state cabinet will meet again on May 5 to review the situation and take a decision whether another extension of lockdown beyond May 7 is required. He said the decision to extend the curbs was taken in the larger interests of the health and lives of people.

The state government also issued orders banning food delivery by Swiggy and Zomato till May 7, citing a case in Delhi where 72 families were quarantined after a pizza delivery boy tested positive for the virus. However, e-commerce stores can deliver groceries, including vegetables and fruits.

KCR said no congregational prayers or celebrations will be allowed for Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Sikhs or any other community. Even prayers during the month of Ramzan have to be offered at home. No permissions would be given for marriages and functions for one more month.
