Malegaon to get north Maharashtra’s biggest quarantine facility
2020-05-13
NASHIK: Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has started the process to set up the biggest quarantine facility in north Maharashtra for suspected novel coronavirus patients in the textile town of Nashik district.


This new facility would be located on the outskirts of the town and would be similar to the one developed at the Bandra Kulra Complex ground in Mumbai.

MMC commissioner Deepak Kasar told TOI that there would be separate Covid care centres (CCCs) for men and women.

“Initially, each of these centres would have 1,000. If needed, the number can be increased to 5,000. MMC would ensure that people who stay at the centres are not inconvenienced,” the civic chief added.

The work to set up the centres has already started and they would be ready within the next eight to 10 days.

Kasar said those quarantined at these centres for 14 days would be provided with proper food. The centres would have proper toilets. Each bed has been placed keeping in mind the social distancing norms. “We have also planned provisions at the centres to offer namaz. There will be medical staff, including nurses to look after the patients. Even doctors would examine them at regular intervals,” MMC officials said.

Civic body sources said the decision to create this new facility on the outskirts of the city was taken to segregate the high-risk contacts of confirmed patients.

“Although MMC has set up quarantine centres within the city, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the authorities to enforce the physical distancing norms. The new facility on the outskirts would help us isolate the suspected patients,” the officials said.

Moreover, a section of residents are apparently unhappy with the facilities at some of the quarantine centres. But the civic administration is confident that there would have no room for complains in the new facilities.
