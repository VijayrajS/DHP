Kolhapur: A resident of the Jawaharnagar area of Ichalkaranji who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi was found by the police after days of search. The man had switched off his cellphone and was hiding in his house ever since he returned from the event.

“We had launched a search operation for people who had attended the Delhi programme. We had appealed to the people to come forward for screening if they have attended the programme. On Tuesday, we received information from sources and local residents from the Jawaharnagar area about a person who had attended the programme in Delhi. We immediately rushed to his house and questioned him,” said a senior police officer.

The man told police that he had attended the programme and returned to Ichalkaranji on March 23. “We did not find any Covid-19 symptoms. However, as a precautionary measure, the man has been sent to institutional quarantine. His throat swab samples have been sent for testing. His family members are also kept under home quarantine,” the officer said.
