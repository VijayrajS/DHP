Coronavirus scare in Tamil Nadu: ‘Bus conductors must avoid using saliva while issuing tickets’
2020-03-13
MADURAI: Conductors using saliva on their fingers while issuing tickets is a common practice. Taking into consideration the Covid-19 outbreak and its nature of spreading through infected fluid such as droplets, a consumer body has written to transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar to intervene and put an end to this practice.


While some government bus conductors issue printed tickets from point of sale machines, most government as well as private town and mini buses in cities and rural areas still use printed tickets. Though the conductor’s pouch has a provision to have a wet sponge for the purpose, saliva is still the preferred mode to wet the finger.

Executive director of Empower centre for consumer and environment education, research and advocacy A Shankar said that by touching their tongue for saliva while issuing ticket directly puts the conductor at risk of getting infected as they could be accidentally dealing with an infected person.

Conductors don’t have the opportunity to wash their hands while collecting the fare, handing over the ticket and balance to every passenger. “The unhealthy practice of touching their tongue with their fingers for every transaction also puts the commuters in the danger of getting infected,” Shankar said.
