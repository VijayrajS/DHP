Vadodara: Lockdown-hit jewellers see sparkle in veggies
2020-05-05
VADODARA: Indrapuri Society in Karelibaug has been thriving on adorned veggies these days. The sumptuous spread includes exotic items like rhodium tomatoes, 18 carat onions, polished bottle gourd, antique ginger and Cuttack work spinach! The reason for this lies in the vendors.


Lockdown-hit jewellers have started selling vegetables adding glamorous jewellery names to the humble greens to lure buyers. With jewellery shop in Ghadiyali Pol and Karodiya Pol closed due to the nationwide lockdown, the owners have switched to eke a living selling vegetables.

On May 2, office bearers of Ghadiyali Pol-Karodiya Pol Jewellers Association bought around 400kgs of vegetables from the APMC market and after sanitizing them, put them up for sale under the banner ‘Sabji Jewellers’.

“We noticed that Covid-19 hit vegetable vendors were infecting their customers too. We, therefore, decided to purchase best quality vegetables from the market ourselves and sell them in our residential societies at a cheaper price,” said Kanu Soni Bavalawala, president of the association.

The society’s residents were informed in advance about their intention and all were asked to get a bucket or a single bag to purchase the vegetables along with face mask and hand gloves.

The group is now planning to contact farmers directly and procure organic vegetables to sell them like the grocers, eliminating middlemen, said another jeweller Harish Soni.
