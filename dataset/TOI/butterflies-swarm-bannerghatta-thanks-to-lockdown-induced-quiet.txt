Butterflies swarm Bannerghatta, thanks to lockdown-induced quiet
2020-04-24
BENGALURU: Thousands of butterflies are descending on Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The brief stopover is part of their annual mass migration from Western Ghats to Eastern Ghats. 

The last time the park saw such an extensive migration was several years ago. According to a BBP entomologist, this is the migratory period of some butterfly species like blue tiger, dark blue tiger, glossy blue tiger, striped tiger, double branded crow and common crow, which are attracted by host plants that are in abundance in the zoo. 

Lokanath V, entomologist of the butterfly park at BBP, said, “Sometimes when it is breezy, we get to see thousands of butterflies swooping down at the same time.” He added, “The main reason for the increase in numbers this time is the lockdown as there’s a lot of silence. Noise tends to scare away these delicate insects.” 

The migrating butterflies are only trying to escape the southwest monsoon due in June. After their long journey to Eastern Ghats, most of them die after laying eggs and completing their life circle. The colourful insects then return to Western Ghats post October and November. These butterflies were last seen in the park in November when they were on their way back home from Eastern Ghats. They fly for about 350km between Western and Eastern Ghats and usually thrive in temperatures ranging from 26 to 28 degrees Celsius. 

“One important thing is this year we have seen Painted Lady, a variety of butterfly, in large numbers, something which has not been witnessed before,” Lokanath added.

A senior BBP official told TOI, “Butterflies have a special position in the insect world due to their attractive appearance. They narrate the story of health and sustainability of the surrounding eco system. They are the best ecological indicator of wildlife as their presence indicates a pollution-free natural environment.”
