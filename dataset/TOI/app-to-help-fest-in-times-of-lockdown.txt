We are trying to put the app on Google Playstore too. Though it is developed for the benefit of Muslims in Dharwad district, many from other states are also using the app,” he added.

DDAEI secretary J S Hadagalim said the app gives timetable for Ramzan-2020 exclusively for Dharwad district, and for Karnataka in general. “It is useful for Muslims to celebrate Ramzan while maintaining social distancing,” he said, adding: “It has features like Tasbee-e-Taraveeh, Dus’s of Ashrah’s, All Dua’s and Tasbees in Arabic, Roman English and Kannada languages.”
