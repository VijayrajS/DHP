KOLHAPUR: Kolhapur airport which is connected to four international airports — Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Tirupati — has witnessed a drop in international travellers, said airport director Kamal Kumar Kataria amid the ongoing coronavirus situation.


He said that the number of travellers coming to Kolhapur from the said cities has dropped tremendously. “We are keeping a record of travellers who have foreign travel history and so far only two people have been named in the database,” he said.

“The creation of database is in accordance with the instructions from higher authorities so as to trace the travellers in case the need arises,” he said.

According to Kataria, the number of domestic passengers too is dwindling, but the impact is much lesser as compared to international travel.

On the safety front, the Kolhapur airport is equipped with hand sanitizers and frequent cleaning is on agenda, he added.

“Hand sanitizers are available in ample quantity in the frequently visited places,” he said.

From Kolhapur airport, flights to the Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Tirupati are operated almost every day by Air Alliance, Indigo, and TruJet.

Besides, a lot of developmental works, including the work of the air traffic control tower, runway extension, and new terminal building, among several others, is being carried out at the airport.

The airport is located in the Ujalaiwadi neighbourhood, around 9 km from the main city.
