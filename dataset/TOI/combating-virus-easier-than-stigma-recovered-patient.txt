Combating virus easier than stigma: Recovered patient
2020-05-18
Aurangabad: Amid the outbreak of the pandemic, the stigma associated with it is worse as Covid-19 patients, recovered patients, their close contacts and frontline workers are facing the brunt of it. Social activists believe that the government, civic administration and public representatives can play a key role in acknowledging the crisis and dealing with it.A man, who lost one of his family members to Covid-19 and recovered from the infection, said that combating the virus was easier than the stigma caused due to it. “A day after we lost one of our family members, when I was going to get milk, one of my neighbour shut the door on me without even asking of our well-being,” the man said.On Saturday night, a sanitation staffer working for Zone 6 of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation was allegedly physically assaulted by residents of Kachhi Ghati. They said that since he is a sanitation worker, he would spread Covid-19 in the hamlet. In another case, locals in Malli Galli pelted stones at a nurse’s house claiming that the nurse could become a source of infection. In another case, a family lost an elderly member to Covid-19 but all the others tested negative for the virus. “When anyone comes to meet us that person is questioned by the locals regarding their visit to our house,” a family member said.Ravi Gaikwad of People’s Voice said, “The government and administration should raise awareness among the people to discourage the discrimination,” said Gaikwad, who alleged that members of particular castes and minorities are suffering the most.
