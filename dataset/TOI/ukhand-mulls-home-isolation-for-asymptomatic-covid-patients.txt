U’khand mulls home isolation for asymptomatic Covid patients
2020-06-07
Dehradun: Keeping in view the steady spike in Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand, the state government is now planning to allow home isolation for patients who are either asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, with strict adherence to the Centre’s guidelines.

State health secretary Amit Negi said that the final decision on offering home isolation would be taken only after consulting all stakeholders and that too only if the necessary standards are met. “With cases rising each day, we have already started Covid Care Centres to ease the load on government hospitals.” The state has 203 such centres at present with a capacity of 17,000 beds. The government medical colleges in Dehradun, Rishikesh, Srinagar and Haldwani are dedicated for critically ill patients. Haridwar’s Mela hospital is also being upgraded for handling critical cases.

With the increasing number of cases in Dehradun, district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava has allowed asymptomatic Covid-19 patients to avail hotel isolation where doctors are also deployed to take care of them. “We have started keeping asymptomatic people in Covid Care Centres. The facility is available for a nominal charge,” he added. 

Based on the order, Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) has shifted over 24 patients in the last couple of days to such centres. Dr NS Khatri, Covid-19 nodal officer at GDMC, said, “This has come as a respite to us. We have also started discharging non-symptomatic patients in 10 days and ask them to opt home isolation.” 

Chief medical superintendent of Susheela Tiwari Medical College, Dr Arun Joshi, also confirmed that the hospital, which was accommodating over 250 patients last week now barely has 20 Covid-19 patients. “We have moved most cases to Covid Care Centres,” he said.
