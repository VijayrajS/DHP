Rajkot: Pitching a daily fight with quarantine violators, the district development officer decided to root out the menace at its base. And so, people who are under home quarantine in rural area now have to deposit their vehicle keys to the office of gram panchayat!

The decision was also taken to restrict movement of such people as it was not possible for the police to keep a watch in each village. Nearly 1,200 people are under home quarantine currently and these people have no travel history to the corona-affected big metros or even to cities like Ahmedabad or also of any interstate travel. 

Talking to TOI, District Development Officer (DDO), A R Ranavasiya said, “We had found out that three or four people had violated home quarantine order and we have also filed FIRs against them. However, in order to implement the order more strictly, we have decided to restrict their movements too and therefore asked them to deposit vehicle keys at panchayat office.” 

The authorities have also decided that action will be taken anybody who tries to help them with vehicles in the village or even otherwise. The officials are also providing food at their home and these people have been given the numbers of the Talati and the Sarpanch in case of any emergency. 

The district administration is also providing help for the animal breeders. If there is nobody to take care of the animals of owners are home quarantine, the gram panchayat will take care of the animals till the time they complete the 14-day stipulated period. The officials also asked these people to maintain a diary of their daily activity. 

The health officials regularly visit these people. So far, only one person has tested positive in Rajkot rural area.
