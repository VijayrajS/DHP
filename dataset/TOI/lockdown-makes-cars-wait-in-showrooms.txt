Andhra Pradesh: Lockdown makes cars wait in showrooms
2020-05-03
VISAKHAPATNAM: The lockdown has certainly jolted the automobile industry. But this Ugadi, those who had booked their vehicles are also in a soup. Despite having paid the booking amount, they haven’t been able to get their cars.


What has exacerbated the problem is that many had sold their old cars to buy new ones in order to save on road tax. Motor vehicles rules in Andhra Pradesh state that people buying a second vehicle have to pay a heftier road tax. Thus, many have been left without cars amid the lockdown.

 


K Srinivas, who recently sold his hatchback to buy a new SUV rues his decision. “I shouldn’t have sold my vehicle in such haste,” he says. Now every time he goes to a shop he is forced to purchase in bulk because movement has become a severe problem as public transport has gone off the roads.

Visveswara Rao, the general manager of Lakshmi Hyundai said, “We have a pending queue of 180 vehicles post lockdown. All these people have booked their vehicles. But we could not complete the registration process because of the lockdown.”

Dealers say that not only new vehicles but even those in service centres could not be returned owing to the lockdown.

“Our business has been hit. We are not sure how much we’ll be able to recover after the lockdown. Our priority will be to deliver the new vehicles as well as the serviced ones,” said Dasaratha Ramreddy, managing partner of Srinivasa Yamaha.
