Covid-19 lockdown takes the shine out of goldsmiths’ lives
2020-04-20
AMARAVATI: Jewellery shops in cities such as Bhimavaram, known for their goldsmiths and gold market, wear a deserted look. Not surprisingly, given the ongoing Covid crisis and people shelving their celebration plans. A few jewellers complained that some of their customers have cancelled orders given the continued uncertainty in the state. 

The nationwide lockdown began just ahead of the wedding season, dashing hopes of profits of about two lakh people belonging to the goldsmith community who already live in poverty.

A majority of the traditional goldsmiths, who lost their wages following the arrival of big jewellery malls, were managing with small orders from loyal customers from rural areas and old families. Although, highly skilled in making ornaments, they were collecting nominal charges for fear of losing business.

“The Covid-19 pandemic has come as a jolt to our people as we were forced to close all shops across the state. We are not even sure how long it would take to revive the market,” rued a goldsmiths’ association leader Kotcherla Srirama Murthy of Bhimavaram, one of the big jewellery towns of the state. 

A goldsmith, Veerachary, from Guntur alleged that since the goldsmiths are not an influential vote bank, the state government has not announced relief packages, like the ones granted for fishermen and weavers, for them. He said even tailors, barbers and autorickshaw drivers have got financial assistance from the government but not the goldsmiths.

In a few towns, associations of goldsmiths have pooled in money from merchants and started distributing essential commodities to the struggling goldsmiths. “Working on gold just doesn’t make us richer. We need some support from the government to survive,” said Sarampati Jagadeesh, a goldsmith from Gudiwada of Krishna district.
