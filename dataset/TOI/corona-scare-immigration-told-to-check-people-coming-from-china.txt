Coronavirus scare: Immigration told to check people coming from China
2020-01-26
VISAKHAPATNAM: Following the Union health ministry’s directive to display advisory on coronavirus at 12 airports across the country, including Vizag, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has issued a circular to immigration officials at the city airport to keep a strict vigil on passengers originating from China.

“We have been asked to check all passengers arriving from any Chinese city for flu-like symptoms, like cold and cough. Such passengers won’t be allowed to enter the city till he or she gets the all-clear from health department officials. The airport director will also be informed,” an immigration official told TOI.

 
 

Screening facilities have already been set up at major airports across the country including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Though there are no direct flights from China to the city, passengers often come to Vizag from Chinese cities via Singapore and Malaysia. Scoot Air connects Visakhapatnam and Singapore thrice a week, while Air Asia operates another thrice-a-week flight to Malaysia.

“We have full details of both foreign and Indian passengers. So it won’t be a difficult task for us to trace the origin location of a passenger. However, it would have been better if they appoint a medical officer at the airport to check whether the passenger is suffering from cold and cough,” the immigration official added.

In 2018-19, around 800 passengers came to Visakhapatnam from China or flew to China from the city, as per immigration department data.
