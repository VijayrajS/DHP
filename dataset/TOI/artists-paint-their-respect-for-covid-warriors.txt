Artists paint their respect for Covid warriors
2020-05-29
SURAT: Fifty-two canvases speak volumes about the fight that the frontline warriors have been putting up against Covid-19 while trying to protect citizens. These art works also reflect the city-based painters’ respect and gratitude for the doctors, nurses and sanitation workers, bold brush strokes and colours adding vibrancy to the untold risks that these people have been undertaking daily in the time of pandemic. 

The unique initiative to pay respect to the frontline warriors through painting was started by city-based Kala Pratishan, a not-for-profit group, which works for painters, sculptures and photogramers.

"We decided to honour these workers through art and also help the painters to express themselves with their brush during the lockdown. We provided 52 artists in the city with canvas and materials two weeks ago and asked them to paint on the theme of frontline warriors. We have also given the artists an honorarium for their work and we will put these paintings up for exhibition once things normalize. We will also share the amount we collect therein with the artists,” Ramnik Zapadiya, president of the pratishan, told TOI. 

Zapadiya added that while artists from across the state are associated with the pratisthan, it could not involve artists living outside Surat city owing to the lockdown rules.
