2020-04-10
KOLHAPUR: Kolhapur district collector Daulat Desai has warned of strict action against violators of the lockdown, saying that some people are still trying to find ways to go to their native places from other states, districts and cities.


In an order on Thursday, he asked all the officials concerned to put such individuals in institutional quarantine and collect their throat swabs for testing. “If anyone resists, file a criminal case against them.” 

“It has been learned that many people are still finding ways to go to their cities or villages taking short-cuts or different routes. This poses grave threat to people. Such individuals should be put in the nearby designated institutional quarantine facility for 14 days,” he said.

Desai said that there will not be any compromise in the 14-day period. They have to undergo the medical check-up and their swab samples need to be collected. 

In Kolhapur district, 79,905 individuals have been found with travel history from cities or the areas that are affected by Covid-19 in the past month. Of these, 11,970 individuals are still under home quarantine while 67,935 have completed the period. 

A total of 634 were found with symptoms of coronavirus and were referred accordingly for further medical treatment. Most of these individuals had a travel history from Pune and Mumbai.
