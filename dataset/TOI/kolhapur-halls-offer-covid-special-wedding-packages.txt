2020-05-27
KOLHAPUR: Several hall operators in Kolhapur have started offering special wedding packages to woo customers during lockdown. These packages are specifically designed keeping in mind the lockdown norms. 

Not more than 50 people are allowed in wedding functions as per the state government's orders. The new wedding packages ensure social distancing, sanitising, providing masks to the guests and use of thermal guns to check body temperature of every person entering the wedding hall, including the bride and the groom. 

The wedding hall operators also provide other arrangements such as serving food to the guests, taking care of all decorations as well as arranging a priest for carrying out wedding rituals. These packages cost around Rs 50,000 per wedding ceremony. 

Rajesh Rajput, a wedding hall operator said, "Since the last few days, we have been getting enquiries for wedding halls. We have sought permissions from local authorities who have asked us to ensure that all the rules are followed. Many engagements have taken place during lockdown, however, most of them were held at home. Since we do not know when things will be back to normal, we have decided to made amends to wedding packages that will be beneficial for us as well as our customers."
