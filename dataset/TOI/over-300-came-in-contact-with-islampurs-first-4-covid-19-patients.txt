Kolhapur: More than 300 people are believed to have come in contact with the four family members from Islampur who were the first to test positive for coronavirus in Sangli district.

The four individuals — all above 50 years of age — had returned from Saudi Arabia on March 14 and had developed symptoms by March 19. They were then isolated from other family members.

Their throat swab samples were sent to the Pune-based NIV on March 21 and results confirmed they had Covid-19 on March 23.

State health minister Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar told TOI that after their return from Saudi Arabia, the family had organised a get-together and served food. The extended family and even non-relatives attended this event and came in contact with the patients.

Yadravkar added that while contact-tracing, the medical authorities were making every effort to track down every person who could have been exposed to the infected family members.

“The health department authorities contacted the family members and even the neighbours for accurate data. Fortunately, many have tested negative for the infection,” he said.

Ranjit Shinde, a newspaper vendor from Islampur, said nobody in Islampur had thought that the place would have so many positive cases. It is high time citizens abide by all the prescribed guidelines and stay indoor.

Ajinkya Adake, a resident of Walva town, around 10 km from Islampur, said people are concerned. “Everybody seems more cautious these days,” he said.

Islampur, meanwhile, remains under the close watch of the district administration. The neighbourhood of the Covid-19-hit family is under lockdown with six entry and exit points. As many as 500 other homes in the area were told to adhere to strict guidelines of home quarantine and the health department is surveying the area.
