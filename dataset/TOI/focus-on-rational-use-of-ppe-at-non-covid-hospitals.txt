2020-05-31
AHMEDABAD: In a circular on Friday, the state health department asked the non-Covid-19 treatment hospitals and non-Covid-19 treatment areas of hospitals for rational use of PPE kits. The department cited a national guideline by DGHS of ministry of health & family welfare.

According to the circular, in OPD areas such as help desk/registration counter, doctorâ€™s chamber, pharmacy, etc having mild or moderate risk need not use PPEs and recommended protection gears include triple layer mask, N95 masks, latex examination gloves and goggles. Likewise, the sanitary staff need to be provided triple-layer mask and latex gloves. 

In the activities such as critical care management, dead body packing, clinical management and in labour room in non-Covid hospitals, the PPE is not required, and protective gears should be worn based on recommendations of DGHS. PPEs however should be used in emergency departments of non-Covid hospitals where the staff is attending to severely ill patients while performing aerosol generating procedure.
