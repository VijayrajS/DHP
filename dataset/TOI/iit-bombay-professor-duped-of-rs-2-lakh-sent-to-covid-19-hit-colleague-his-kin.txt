MUMBAI: Online fraudsters are cashing in on the Covid pandemic to dupe unsuspecting people. A professor at the IIT-Bombay was duped of Rs 2 lakh he transferred by way of cash vouchers to treat his colleague and a relative “affected by Covid”.


A professor lodged a complaint at Powai police station on Saturday, stating that he had received an email in his official email account from the personal email account of his colleague saying he and a relative of his had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and were admitted to intensive care. The mail sought financial help and went on to explain that a mail was being sent as they could not call up while being in the intensive care unit.

The professor , who saw the mail on Friday evening, said he had no reason to doubt its genuineness as it had come in from his colleague ’s account through which the two communicated often.

The complaint states that soon after checking his mail, he sent details of online vouchers worth Rs 2 lakh to an email address given in the email he had got.

Soon after, he received another request for Rs 50,000 more. “The professor found that intriguing and suspicious,” said a police officer.

He at once called up his colleague only to be told that neither was any of his relatives hospitalised nor had he made any request for money. That is when he realised that he had been duped, said the officer.

The police are trying to get details of the internet protocol (IP) address used to hack into his colleague’s email account. Senior inspector of Powai police station, Sudhakar Kamble, said this is a new trend “fraudsters are taking advantage of the pandemic to cheat people,” he said.

Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said this scam is called a ‘family emergency scam’ or ‘grandparents scam’ in the US. “It is best to call and verify the authenticity of the mail before transferring any cash,” said Bhatia.
