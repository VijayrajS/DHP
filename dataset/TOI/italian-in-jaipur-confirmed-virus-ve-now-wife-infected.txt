JAIPUR: The Italian tourist who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) at a Jaipur hospital on Monday was confirmed virus-positive on Tuesday by the National Institute of Virology, Pune which examined his throat swabs and blood samples. His wife, meanwhile, also tested positive in screening at Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital on Tuesday.


Health authorities in Rajasthan are now worried that the 69-year-old Italian national and his wife might have put a lot of people at risk because he visited major tourist destinations in the state as part of a group of 23 tourists from Italy.

“We are sending her samples to Pune,” the SMS Hospital superintendent, Dr D S Meena, said. Since her husband had fallen ill, she had stayed back in Jaipur while their group of Italian tourists went on to Agra. “We have admitted her to the isolation facility,” said SMS Medical College principal Dr Sudhir Bhandari.
