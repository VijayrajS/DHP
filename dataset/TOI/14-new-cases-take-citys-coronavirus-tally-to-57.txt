Besides, three members of a family — a couple and their minor son — who had recently returned from Mumbai also tested positive for novel coronavirus. The three had returned from Mumbai on May 12 and were isolated at a quarantine centre. They later tested positive for the disease. 

All patients were admitted to Covid-19 Level One Hospital in Kotwa and Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital for treatment.

The administration has appealed to all migrants returning from other states to their native towns that they should quarantine themselves for 21 days at home. They have also been asked not to spit in public places and those who are suffering from cough, fever and running nose could contact health department officials for getting themselves tested for novel coronavirus.
