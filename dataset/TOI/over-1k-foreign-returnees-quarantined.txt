Visakhapatnam: The district administration has prepared a list of around 1,000 people who returned from abroad in the last 15 days but have not been quarantined yet. They have been asked to be stay in home isolation for at least a week and will be kept under strict vigil. If they were to develop symptoms of cold and cough thwy will have to inform the health department. 

The decision comes in the wake of a 65-year old man from Alipuram testing positive for COVID-19 about six days after his return from Saudi Arabia.

Officials said, a person can develop the symptoms anytime within 15 days after coming in contact with the virus. So they have decided to monitor everybody who arrived in Visakhapatnam in the last 15 days, even if they did not suffer from any of the symptoms when they arrived. 

“Take for example the 65-year old man. When he landed at the Hyderabad airport he was normal and was allowed to leave the airport. But after two days he suddenly developed symptoms and was tested positive. So we don’t want to take any risk with other people like him who have a travel history abroad,” a senior health official told TOI.

So far the immigration officials have compiled the data of 851 people from the district who landed at the Visakhapatnam airport in the last 15 days.
