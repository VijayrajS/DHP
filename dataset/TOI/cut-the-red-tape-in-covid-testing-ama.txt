Cut the red tape in Covid testing: AMA
2020-05-23
Ahmedabad: Representatives of the Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) again complained to the state government’s health department about the delay in providing permission to carry out Covid-19 tests. The delay is hampering several medical procedures daily, they said.

In a letter to Jayanti Ravi, the principal secretary (health), Dr Mona Desai, the president of the AMA, mentioned that a response has not been forthcoming from the chief district health officer (CDHO) for two to three days after the application for testing.

“It becomes very difficult to treat the patient and in emergency cases, it would lead to fatal results,” read the letter. “You need to look into this matter, otherwise opening clinics will not serve the purpose and this system will prove catastrophic.”

The state government’s policy of allowing Covid-19 tests at designated private labs only after permission of the CDHO has been criticized by the medical fraternity. The state government had then come up with a list of exceptions where the tests could be carried out on priority. However, the move has not been effective, claimed surgeons in Ahmedabad city.

“We hear that the move is to ensure that there are no unnecessary tests, but if one person clears hundreds of requests a day based on merit, how much time would it take?” said a senior surgeon of a private hospital. “Not all the cases are the same — if there is an emergency procedure without a test, it can put treating doctors, medical staff and the hospital at risk.”
