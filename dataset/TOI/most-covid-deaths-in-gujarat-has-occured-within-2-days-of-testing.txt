AHMEDABAD: Even as Gujarat on Wednesday recorded 13 Covid deaths, taking the state’s toll to 103, data revealed that in 66% of the cases, death came to the positive patient within two days of testing.


Analysis of 71 Covid death cases recorded till April 19 – for which data of admission, testing and death is available – showed that 66%, or two-thirds of the positive cases, saw death within two days. Out of 47 who died within two days, 13 passed away the same day they tested positive, 15 died a day after and 19 succumbed two days later.

On the other hand, there were seven patients who were hospitalized for more than 10 days before they succumbed to the infection. A 69-year-old woman from Vadodara died on the 17th day after her report came positive. Experts said that in several cases, admission of the patients is late and that’s the reason for early death rate.

“People with symptoms need to seek medical help early and not delay getting hospitalized once they get the symptom of difficulty in breathing. Majority of critical patients are coming late. Early detection and medical help can boost chances of survival,” said Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare).

Out of the 13 deaths on Wednesday, nine were recorded from Ahmedabad alone, while three were from Vadodara and one from Valsad, Ravi said, adding that the state recorded 229 fresh cases during the day, which took the positive count to 2,407.

Possibly the only silver lining for the state on Wednesday was the discharge of a record 40 patients after they completed their treatment by fully recovering from coronavirus.

With these discharges, Gujarat has 179 people who have trumped the virus. The state currently has a recovery rate of 7.4%, Ravi added.
