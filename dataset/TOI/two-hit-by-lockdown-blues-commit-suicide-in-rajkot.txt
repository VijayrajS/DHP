Rajkot: Frustrated with the ongoing lockdown period, two persons including a 70-year-old man committed suicide in Rajkot in the past 24 hours. 

On Saturday morning, Bechar Solanki (70) hanged himself to death from the ceiling fan of his house in Lakshmivadi Quarters in Rajkot.

“According to his family members, Solanki had been suffering from depression ever since he was unable to go for a morning walk as it was a punishable offence under the lockdown. This drove him to take the drastic step,” said Narendra Bhadrecha, assistant sub-inspector with Bhaktinagar police station. 

Earlier on Friday night, Nilesh Sanchala (35) ended his life by consuming pesticide at his residence in New Sagar Society on Kotharia Road. Police said Sanchala used to work as a tailor. Sanchala had taken a shop on rent for tailoring work on Kotharia Road. His work was suspended due to the lockdown, and post lockdown after he was allowed to open his shop, he did not get any work. 

“Sanchala was extremely worried on paying rent for his shop. This drove him to take the extreme step,” added Bhadrecha. Sanchala is survived by his parents and brother. Sanchala was bachelor.
