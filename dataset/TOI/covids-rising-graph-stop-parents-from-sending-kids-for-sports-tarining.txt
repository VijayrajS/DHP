Ludhiana: The rising number of Covid-19 cases has raised a sense of fear among the parents of local trainees of different coaching centres of sports department and they have started to restrict their children from attending the regular training sessions for the past several days continuously.

Due to lack of presence of local trainees in different coaching centres, the higher authorities have decided to extend their decision of keeping most of local training centres in the district closed until further orders, with just a few remaining open. However, the sports department has given instructions to local coaches to continue their regular online practice session for trainees until the number of Covid-19 cases go down in the next few months.

Parveen Thakur, a Judo coach, said, “As the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing with each passing day in the district, it has led to scare among parents of local trainees and so they avoid sending their children to attend the daily practice sessions. Moreover, government coaches are also not forcing players to attend practice sessions daily at the local training centres.”

“With coaches promoting online training during these days, so I have also adopted the modern way of conducting online training session with local trainees. For the last two last months after government bodies enforced the strict lockdown, sports activities didn’t stop as sports department kept on providing online training session to trainees.” 

“For the past two months, I have been delivering the guidance on mobile phone to all my trainees about the exercises which can be easily done by remaining inside their homes to remain physically and mentally fit for upcoming tournaments,” Thakur told TOI.

Another coach of the sport department, Kuldeep Singh, who is a tennis coach, said, “After facing the issue of lack of presence of trainees at the training centre, I have adopted the mode of giving training skills to local trainees through certain digital gadgets on a daily basis.”
