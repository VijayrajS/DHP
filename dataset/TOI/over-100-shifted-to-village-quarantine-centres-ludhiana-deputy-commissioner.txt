LUDHIANA: Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal has informed that more than 100 persons have been sent to quarantine centres set up in their respective villages from the isolation centre set up at Meritorious School here. Upon reaching their villages, these people would remain in quarantine in their own villages.

So far, out of 282 persons, 100 persons have been shifted to quarantine centres in their respective villages, while 22 students who had returned from Kota (Rajasthan) are under quarantine at Parker House, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), here. He said, “At present, only 102 persons are left in the Isolation Centre at Meritorious School here.”

Agrawal said the persons who have been shifted to the quarantine centres had tested negative for novel coronavirus (Covid-19), and said the samples of those persons had come out negative. “They were now being shifted to their respective villages to complete their 14-day quarantine, so that they remain mentally and emotionally strong, as they will be close to their family members now.”

The deputy commissioner informed that best quality hygienic food was being provided to persons staying at the isolation centres. He said that to wash the laundry of the isolation centre, a new machine had also been installed that would be used to wash bedsheets and other clothes on a daily basis.

It is pertinent to mention that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had ordered that people returning from other states would be quarantined for 14 days in government isolation centres. He had also directed officials to identify buildings or schools in villages in consultation with the sarpanches. The chief minister has also appealed to panchayats and sarpanches to increase vigil in their respective areas to check the spread of Covid-19.
