UP fails to reduce sugar production due to lockdown
2020-05-20
Bijnor: State government's plan to reduce sugar production this year has failed to take off due to the imposition of the lockdown.As against 27.94 lakh hectares under cane cultivation in 2018, this season, cane was sown across 26.63 lakh hectares in 2019.This crushing season has also seen increased production of ethanol from B heavy molasses. Yet, sugar production has increased by over 5% as of now and the crushing season is still going on.One of the primary reasons for high sugar production is the closure of jaggery units due to the lockdown. Around 10% of cane is consumed by these units and all of it was diverted to the mills.Additional cane Commissioner VK Shukla said, "This year, operation of kolhus and crushers was badly hit by unseasonal rain and the lockdown. The sugarcane which they used to crush was diverted to mills." Both domestic and commercial consumption of cane juice has down since the lockdown was announced.On their part, mills also extended crushing season this year.Last year, 96 out of the 119 mills were closed on May 18 while this time, only 72 mills have stopped their operations. Similarly, last year two mills manufactured B heavy molasses from sugarcane while this time round, 26 mills are producing it. The B molasses is used to manufacture ethanol. Bijnor sugar mill's administrative officer AK Singh said, "Sugarcane yield has increased as weather was condusive to the crop. The juice extraction was higher as temperature was lower than normal due to unseasonal rainfall. This has boosted sugar production."
