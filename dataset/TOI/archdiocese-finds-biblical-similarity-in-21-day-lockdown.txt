Archdiocese finds Biblical similarity in 21-day lockdown
2020-03-28
Kolkata: At the special prayer at the Archbishop House late on Wednesday evening, the decision of PM Modi to lock down the country in a bid to fight coronavirus was compared with the Biblical reference of Prophet Daniel. This was part of the Adoration and recitation of the Rosary by vicar general Dominic Gomes on Wednesday — at the Feast of Annunciation. 

“In the PM’s 21 days of lockdown, we see a Biblical similarity to the book of Daniel, chapter 9:15 where Prophet Daniel closes the door outside and, in obedience behind the locked door, he prays and fasts for 21 days, doing God’s will and saves his people,” the vicar said. He called out to the followers of the archdiocese to similarly spend time in prayers, because at the end of the lockdown, once again life will beckon. “As we worship, He will heal us from Covid-19,” the Adoration prayer read.

During the recitation of the Rosary, a five-step prayer, the traditional words from the Bible were suffixed with references to coronavirus to pray for healing. 

Just like the previous Sunday, this week too, Archbishop Thomas D Souza has decided to read online mass that will be broadcast on social media for all parishioners to see and participate in. Churches are shut for prayers at the moment and in this month of Lent, this initiative had made sure parishioners are not missing their Sunday service.
