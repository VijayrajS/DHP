2020-05-19
Bhopal: The health department will undertake a massive 10-day drive to cover for missed immunisations, starting from Wednesday. The drive is expected to catch up with about 7 lakh missed vaccinations across the state in the last three months due to the Covid-19 lockdown.

“Zero dose was not affected during the lockdown. Effect of vaccination is being ascertained,” said MP department of health, state nodal officer, immunization programme, Dr Santosh Shukla. Zero dose mainly serves as priming dose, which is administered at the time of birth to the baby for oral polio vaccine, first dose of hepatitis B and BCG vaccines. 

Interestingly, with no lesser movement of people and most staying at home, immunization coverage utilization has increased in Jhabua (2%), Ratlam (7%), Umaria (19%), Balaghat (24%) and Katni (24%). 

The percentage drop between February and March was about 12%. It increased to 46% between February and April. However, the situation recovered in March to April with a drop of about 39%, according to trends in vaccine consumption (increase / decrease). 

Going by the trends’ percentage drop in immunisation between March and April, the worst impacted are 92% drop in Indore, 89% Burhanpur and 85% in Bhopal.
