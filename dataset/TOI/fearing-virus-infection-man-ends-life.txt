Jaipur: A 34-year-old man committed suicide in Churu on Thursday night apparently due to fear of being infected by coronavirus. The deceased, identified as Mukesh Swami, worked as a watchman and caretaker of a house whose owners stay out of town. 

Kotwali Churu SHO Subhash Chandra said, “Mukesh’s body was found hanging from the hook of the fan in the kitchen. We also found a suicide note in his pocket which said he was taking his life willingly as he feared that he was coronavirus positive.” 

According to officials, Mukesh had been staying alone for the past two years in Churu while his family stayed in the village. 

“We do not know why he thought he contracted the virus. Perhaps he went to the hospital recently and thought that he was coronavirus positive because of which he lost his mental balance,” added the official. 

Taking precautionary measures, the deceased’s body has been kept in the mortuary and samples taken to test for Covid-19. Chandra said, “We do not know if Mukesh was really positive. But no chances can be taken at this point. Doctors have taken his samples for testing.”
