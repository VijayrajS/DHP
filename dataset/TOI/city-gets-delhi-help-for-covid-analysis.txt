2020-05-15
NAGPUR: Dr Sanjay Zodpey, a director in New Delhi’s Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), has conducted a detailed analysis of the Covid-19 situation in the city and given guidance how to deal in case of a sudden rise in cases. He made a detailed presentation at the divisional commissioner’s office on Thursday.

Zodpey is also vice-president of Academics of PHFI which is an autonomously governed public private initiative registered under the Societies Registration Act.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI that Zodpey is also on the committee of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and “an expert in tackling epidemic”. “He is a Nagpur resident and happened to be here. Therefore, we asked him to do an analysis,” he said.

Kumar is expecting help from him on technical issues. 

A team from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which included municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, chief medical officer Dr Yogendra Savai and additional chief medical officer Dr Praveen Gantawar, were present. They too gave a presentation of innovative steps implemented by the civic body.

Zodpey’s help is also being sought on development of Covid Care Centres and Dedicated Covid Health Centres, and management of suspected and positive persons.
