Covid effect: Competitive exam aspirants in a fix
2020-04-24
Ranchi: The rising number of Covid-19 cases has put aspirants of competitive examinations in a spot. When many national- and state-level competitive examinations have already been postponed, some students are struggling to cope with online learning.

A civil service aspirant, Swati Choubey, said, “There is an uncertainty over when the civil services exam will be conducted. Interviews for the last year were stopped midway, so it becomes difficult to gauge when the preliminary exam will be held this year.”

Talking about her preparations, Choubey added, “Initially, I faced problems as I couldn’t get hard copies of study materials, but now I am slowly adapting to online classes.”

Akanksha Pallav, an LLM in corporate law from HNLU and a judicial service aspirant, said, “I have applied for judicial services in Jharkhand as well as neighbouring states but the recruitment processes have been postponed till further orders. I now fear that those exams will be conducted simultaneously and I may not be able to appear in all of them.”

Another aspirant, Harsh Kumar, who was preparing for the NDA examination for the last one year, said, “The test was scheduled to be conducted on April 19 but was called off owing to the lockdown. I do not know when the exam would he held. I fear that owing to the delay, I may not be able to sit exam as age bar is likely to be crossed and all my preparations would go to waste.”

Students of other competitive examinations like banking and SSC have also been left in the lurch. “I had returned home for Holi but soon after that lockdown was imposed. All my study materials are in New Delhi. Some of my friends forwarded me soft copies of study materials and I’m currently preparing for the exams with the help of those notes,” said Rahul Kumar, a banking job aspirant.
