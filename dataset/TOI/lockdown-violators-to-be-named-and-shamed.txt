'Coronavirus lockdown violators to be named and shamed'
2020-03-27
KARWAR: Those defying the Covid-19 lockdown orders in Uttara Kannada will get stamped in their hands with indelible. The names of second-time offenders will be announced near their residences in the public announcement system. In case of third office, the photographs of violators will be uploaded to the district administration’s official website.

Deputy commissioner Harish Kumar K said on Thursday that some people are unable to understand the gravity of the situation. “It is high time we took stern action against such people. It would be more effective if we create a social pressure by making public the names of violators,” said Kumar.

He said the district administration is trying hard to provide basic amenities to every doorstep. “By Friday, it will be streamlined,” he said.

Currently, traders are supplying essential commodities under the administration’s supervision.
