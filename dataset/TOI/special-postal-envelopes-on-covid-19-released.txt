2020-04-30
COIMBATORE: For the first time in the country, the Coimbatore postal division has released postal envelopes with a Covid-19 franking slogan.


‘To fight against Covid-19 pandemic, wear face mask at workplace’ is printed on 300 exclusive envelopes enclosed in presentation packs. They will be available for sale at the Philatelic Bureau at the Good Shed Road Post Office.

The envelopes are expected to be part of philatelic collections as they cannot be used for posting. “Franking is a system that we use when we get bulk postal orders. No stamps are required on such envelopes. The envelope has the value of the stamp, the name of the post office and the coronavirus theme printed on it,” said senior superintendent of post offices Sudhir Gopal Jakhere.

The envelope was released on the eve of the annual World Day for Safety and Health at Work. “These are the concepts we want to create awareness about. We are right now experiencing a historical event and this is our way of documenting it,” said Jakhere.

Senior philatelists in the district said that any philately collection on a historical event like Covid-19 is a way to chronicle it. “We expect covid theme philately products and postal stationary to be in great demand in the years to come,” said philatelist P Selvaraju. “These postcards and franking symbols will remember our future generations about this pandemic by exact date, year and prompt them to recall and explore the stories around it,” he told TOI.

This is the second set of philatelic products released by the postal division on the Covid-19 pandemic. Last week, it had launched a special set of postcards to thank frontline workers such as doctors, medical staff, sanitary workers and postmen, and to promote social distancing.
