2020-04-28
KOLKATA: The state recorded the highest single-day discharge of cured Covid patients on Monday. 12 persons were sent home from MR Bangur Hospital (MRBH), the state’s biggest Covid-designated facility. The 12 included two healthcare workers and a 62-year-old woman. All 12 have tested negative to two consecutive tests.

“It is a good feeling that we have won the battle against corona. I feel overwhelmed that I am going home. I am more than willing to donate my plasma if that helps in the fight against the virus,” said the young nurse of Charnock Hospital. 

The other nurse is attached with MRBH itself. She also expressed her willingness to donate plasma if she was eligible for it. Both the healthcare workers vowed to go back to their jobs once they complete another 14-days home isolation. 

“There is no looking back and shunning the profession of a healthcare worker just because one got infected. I will go back on my job once I am through the home isolation period,” said the other nurse. 

Out of the 12 discharged, 10 were women from different parts of the city while the two were men. 

“The doctors and nurses took good care of us and the treatment facility was good. It feels good to be back home finally,” said the 62-year-old woman. 

The senior citizen was admitted about two weeks ago at BM Birla Heart Research Institute for a pace maker surgery. On finding Covid-19 symptoms, doctors sent her swab samples. She was later shifted to MRBH hospital when the samples tested positive. 

“We are happy to send the 12 home after following protocols and guidelines of discharging Covid positive patients. We appeal to people to follow social distancing measures and hand hygiene to keep the virus at bay,” said Sisir Naskar, superintendent MRBH. 

The hospital officials clapped and presented bouquets while seeing off the Covid survivors. So far, 109 patients have recovered in the state and have been sent home.
