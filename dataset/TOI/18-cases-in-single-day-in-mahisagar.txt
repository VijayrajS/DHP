VADODARA: With 18 persons testing positive for Covid-19 on a single day, panic triggers were pressed in the Mahisagar district. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the district now stands at 112.

The cases reported on Wednesday include three each from Lunawada, Santrampur, Khanpur and Virpur talukas as well as six from Balashinor taluka. What has raised eyebrows is the fact that some of these cases have been reported from remote villages. Only one of the cases reported on Wednesday had a travel history. The man had returned from Kuwait and was quarantined.

Mahisagar has witnessed a steady rise in Covid-19 infections. Most cases so far were of persons who had travel history to Covid-19 affected places or of health workers as well as policemen on duty in the district.

Officials said that the only possibility of people from interior villages getting infected was that they may have contacted the disease while visiting a shop to buy necessities or at places like milk cooperatives where many villagers go to pour milk.

Mahisagar district health officer Dr S B Shah said that the 18 new cases were from the tests of 101 persons. He added that officials were visiting the residences of all the positive cases to gather details.

Sources said that so far two persons who had tested positive for Covid-19 had died in the district. One of these deaths is, however, yet too be declared officially as a death audit was being conducted.
