Jaipur: Eight more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Rajasthan on Saturday. While Bhilwara registered five fresh cases, Jaipur, Pali and Pratapgarh recorded one case each.

With this, the total number of people infected with the virus in the state touched 25, including the three who were cured in Jaipur. Of the two Italian tourists cured, one died of cardiac arrest on Friday.

Bhilwara has become the epicentre of the pandemic in the state with 11 cases reported in the past two days. All of them are doctors and nursing staff members with no recent travel history. Since Friday evening, the entire city is under curfew.

The fresh cases in Bhilwara were reported from the same private hospital where six people were diagnosed with the disease on Friday. The entire city is under lockdown as the district administration is not allowing any outward and inward movement of people.

The administration has created a containment zone to screen people. As a precautionary step, the hospital has been sealed after disinfecting it. “All five new cases of Bhilwara are hospital staff,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health department.

Since all the cases have been reported from a private hospital, the health department is taking it as a major challenge to contain the spread of the disease. A massive campaign has been launched in Bhilwara to check all patients who had undergone treatment at the private hospital.

Since February, 658 people have undergone tests for the virus. Test reports of 42 samples are still awaited.

Concerned over the increasing number of cases in the state, the health department has issued directions to all the district collectors to remain prepared to deal with the situation.
