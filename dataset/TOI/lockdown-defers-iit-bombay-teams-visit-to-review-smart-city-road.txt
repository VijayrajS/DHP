Lockdown defers IIT-Bombay team’s visit to review Smart City road
2020-04-07
NASHIK: The arrival of IIT-Bombay team to review the uneven stretches on the maiden Smart City road has been deferred because of the ongoing nation-wide lockdown.


Around two months ago, the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) had admitted that the construction of the smart road was improper and it was uneven at some stretches. The corporation had written to IIT-Bombay seeking help. “The institute had sought some information from us. We submitted all the details and the team from IIT-Bombay was to visit the city on March 28 for a review. The team could not come due to the lockdown,” sources in NMSCDCL said, adding that the team will visit only after things get back to normal. tnn
