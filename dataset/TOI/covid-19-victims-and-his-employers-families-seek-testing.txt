According to his family members, he died even as he was being wheeled into the Asarwa Civil Hospital.Gulab Bajwa, a football coach by profession, said that Lal Bahadur showed symptoms of Covid-19 on May 22, and visited the nearest designated corona hospital at Chandkheda as a x-ray showed inflammation of the lungs. “They just noted his name and number and sent him back, saying that they will call him when the vehicle arrives,” Bajwa alleged. Lal Bahadur worked as a manager in the security firm owned by Bajwa’s father.Bajwa said that on Sunday, Gorkha again complained of breathlessness and was taken to the SMS hospital, where there was no ventilator arrangement. “His family members took him to Asarwa Civil Hospital, where he expired even as he was being admitted,” Bajwa said. The postmortem report made available the next day said Gorkha was Covid positive.“I met him four days before he expired. His family members stayed with him. We have been asking the authorities to get our Covid tests done, but we are not getting any favourable response,” Bajwa said. He added that when they call various helplines or visit hospitals seeking a Covid test, they are sent back or prescribed medicines.“We are volunteering to get our tests done, but the authorities are not getting us tested. If any of us are positive, and are not being tested, we might end up infecting others,” said Bajwa.
