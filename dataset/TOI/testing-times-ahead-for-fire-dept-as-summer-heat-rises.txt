Testing times ahead for Delhi's fire department as summer heat rises
2020-05-23
NEW DELHI: Delhi Fire Service (DFS) will be on its toes for the next few months to prevent large-scale damage owing to blazes in slums. On average, the department deals with 150 slum fires every year caused due to the summer heat.

Fire officials said they would be requesting JJ colony residents and Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board to be more careful since most slums cannot be rebuilt due to the migration of labourers. They would be visiting a few slums to educate residents about the measures that could be taken to prevent fire in summer after the lockdown period gets over.




In the past 15 days, DFS has received 15 calls of fires in JJ colonies. Most fires reported in the months of May and June occur due to short circuit in power units that were inactive during winter. In such colonies, people use locally-made room coolers and pedestal fans that do not have proper electrical wiring.

Moreover, the dry weather can cause fires to spread to neighbouring houses. As a result, rescue operations take more time as parallel operations need to run to stop the fire from spreading. DFS chief Atul Garg said, “We will be advising people against running appliances for a long duration. Also, flammable material should not be kept on the roofs.”

The peak hours — between 10am and noon — are considered crucial as the number of calls suddenly surges during this time due to the daytime heat. Firemen said most fires were found to have originated from garbage dumps. It gets worse if it’s a windy day.

The average response time for the fire department is less than five minutes in most cases, but blazes in slums have a tendency of spreading rapidly. Because of this, the chances of fatalities are higher, officials said.

“Most people don’t keep safety equipment, such as a bucket of water, which can prove crucial in containing the blaze immediately. Dry walls also aid in the fire spreading within minutes,” a fire official said.
