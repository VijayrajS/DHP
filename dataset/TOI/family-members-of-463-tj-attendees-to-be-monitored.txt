Family members of 463 Tablighi Jamaat attendees to be monitored
2020-04-02
HYDERABAD: Shaken by the events unfolding across the country due to the Tablighi Jamaat event, the government has decided to send all attendees to state-run quarantine facilities in the city. Multi-disciplinary teams scoured the city for the second consecutive day on Wednesday and tracked down 463 of the 630 attendees so far and sent them to quarantine facilities.



Though only some with symptoms were sent to state-run quarantine centres on Tuesday, the rest were also sent for isolation on Wednesday. “ Initially the plan was to home quarantine asymptomatic people and inspect their health for 14 days, but following orders from government, we shifted them to quarantine centres,” a GHMC official, requesting anonymity, told TOI. The family members of the 463 attendees would be under watch too. Home quarantine stickers were also pasted on houses of the attendees and extensive sanitisation was taken up in those areas. 

The teams had identified the returnees from Charminar , Khairatabad, Yosufguda, Banjara Hills, Secunderabad and Gajularamaram. “Identification of the remaining is underway, the details of their tests will be given out in medical bulletin,” a GHMC official said. 

“We were unable to trace a few people based on their residential address. We contacted them on phone,” a GHMC official said. The entire process went off without a hitch, GHMC officials said. 

An official monitoring inspection in the IT corridor said the returnees complied with instructions. “A person who attended the TJ event did show any symptoms, but his neighbours insisted he be shifted to hospital. The person volunteered for a check-up,” a GHMC official from Serilingampally zone said.
