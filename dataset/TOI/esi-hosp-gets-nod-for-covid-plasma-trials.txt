HYDERABAD: ESI Hospital at Sanathnagar have received permission to carry out plasma therapy trials for Covid- 19 patients along with the state-run Gandhi Hospital. ICMR officially accorded permission to both hospitals for six months. 


According to officials, ESI Hospital does not have any Covid-19 patients but has isolation wards with suspected cases. ESI will first have to get Covid-19 patients to begin the plasma trials. 

Doctors said elaborate procedures would be conducted before beginning plasma treatment. The patients are first counselled along with the donors, who have undergone Covid-19 treatment and got discharged. Certain pre-medical conditions of both have to be matched. Health minister Eatala Rajender said Gandhi Hospital does not have patients who need such treatment. But many donors are ready to give plasma after they were treated at Gandhi Hospital.
