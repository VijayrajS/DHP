AMBALA: Health department personnel on Thursday sent a 60-year-old woman to isolation in Yamunanagar when she showed symptoms similar to coronavirus infection after returning from Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.


“The woman does not have any foreign travel history but a while ago she traveled within the country. She showed some symptoms like cold and cough; therefore, we isolated her at a ward in civil hospital and sent her swab sample for examination at the BPS Medical College for Women in Sonepat. We are expecting her reports by Friday,” Yamunanagar civil surgeon Dr Vijay Dahiya said. 

In Ambala, a 28-year-old woman with travel history to Chennai (nearly a month ago) has been isolated and her samples have been sent for inspection to PGIMER in Chandigarh.

“The woman had returned from Chennai nearly a month ago and on Thursday, she visited city hospital with some symptoms and voluntarily asked the doctors to take her samples for coronavirus test,” Ambala civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep said. 


Two of Kurukshetra test negative

Meanwhile, swab reports of two Kurukshetra residents have been found negative of coronavirus infection.

“Two Kurukshetra residents, who were isolated on Tuesday, have tested negative for Covid-19 and on Thursday, they were discharged from the hospital,” civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep said.
