2020-06-05
AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt said that the state health department has prohibited the AMC from giving out Covid-related information.

 The AMC had stopped giving out names of patients since May 17, and has now stopped giving addresses of patients after new directions from the state health department.

Bhatt said, “We have been asked by the state health department not to pass on any information about Covid-19 patients hence the AMC has stopped issuing the daily list. These instructions were passed specifically for Ahmedabad city only. The health department was issuing different guidelines for different cities.”

Speaking to the media after the standing committee meeting, Bhatt said the city now has 117 containment zones. The civic body has also begun giving medicines and treatment to people at their doorsteps. 

While 50 Dhanvantari and Aarogya Raths were treating people earlier, the city now has 82 Arogya raths.

Bhatt said the AMC has also started distributing medical kits to people and 2.5 lakh such kits have been distributed. The civic body first distributed these medical kits in red zones or wards under containment, and it is now distributing them in other parts of the city.

About the issue with private hospitals, Bhatt said that initially there were some issues, but these have been sorted out and all notified 42 private hospitals are now accepting patients as expected.
