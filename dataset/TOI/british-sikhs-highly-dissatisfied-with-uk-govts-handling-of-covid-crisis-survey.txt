2020-05-29
London: A survey examining the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the British Sikh community has found “extremely high levels of dissatisfaction” with the UK government over its handling of the crisis.The survey of 1,553 British Sikhs by the Sikh Network found that 92% did not think the government acted quickly enough to tackle the pandemic. One Sikh woman even blamed two deaths in her family on the government “not sharing guidance and advice to those most vulnerable sooner”.Nearly 96% said they were “very concerned” with the high proportion of Sikh deaths from Covid-19, “which are approximately twice the national average”. British Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi has lost three family members to the viral infection.Of the Sikhs working in the NHS or social care sector, 88% stated they were “very unsatisfied” with the availability of PPE kits, with one NHS Sikh worker describing the lack of preparation for the crisis and government incompetence as “corporate manslaughter”. Further, 88% of the respondent said they were “very unhappy” with the UK’s testing strategy, specifically the delay in being tested, the time it takes to get results and also missing results. One Sikh woman working in a care home said, “I have been working on the frontline since Day 1, but have still not been tested.”Besides, 85% of those Sikhs working in the NHS or social care, or those with immediate family members working in these sectors said Covid-19 had created unbearable strains within the family due to lack of testing, lack of availability of proper PPE, high proportion of BAME deaths and the need to be ultra-cautious not to spread the disease to loved ones. One Sikh nurse said she was paying for a hotel out of her own pocket to self-isolate from mother-in-law and the daily trauma and isolation was making her depressed.As many as 86% stated the government had been negligent by not issuing funeral guidance specific to each faith. Many suggested this had created huge problems for bereaved Sikh families.Moreover, 98% were extremely unhappy that the government did not consult gurdwaras before forcing them to close their doors to the public and 95% said the government has failed to properly engage with gurdwaras on their re-opening. Also, 95% stated the government failed to appreciate the significance of gurdwaras to the Sikh way of life and 91% said they were comfortable with re-opening gurudwaras to the public.Nine out of 10 Sikhs stated the Foreign and Commonwealth Office did far too little to support tens of thousands of British Sikhs stranded in Punjab.Yet despite this widespread dissatisfaction, more than 100 gurduwaras have prepared and distributed more than one million free meals since the start of the lockdown — amounting to 1,20,000 free meals per week — to those most vulnerable and to NHS frontline workers, the report said.
