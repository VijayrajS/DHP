KRISHNAGIRI: Eleven people, including nine members of a doctor, who is working in Villupuram GH and tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, have been placed under home quarantine in the Krishnagiri town. 


The doctor came to visit his family at New Housing Board area in Katikanapalli panchayat on the outskirts of the town on Saturday on leave. After spending two days there, he returned to Villupuram on Monday. On the same night, he showed symptoms of the virus. “The health department tested his blood and throat swab samples,” a senior official said. He said the results turned positive on Wednesday.

The Villupuram district administration immediately alerted Krishnagiri collector S Prabhakar, who in turn ordered health officials to quarantine nine of his family members and two neighbours who came in contact with him. The doctor’s wife is also a doctor, who is working in the government hospital in Krishnagiri. “We have collected throat swab samples from all the 11 people and results will be out on Thursday,” Prabhakar told TOI. tnn
