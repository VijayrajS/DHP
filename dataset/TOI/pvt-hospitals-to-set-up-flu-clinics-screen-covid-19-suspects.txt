Private hospitals to set up flu clinics in Haridwar, screen Covid-19 suspects
2020-03-25
HARIDWAR: Flu clinics are being set up in Haridwar and other districts in the state “for free treatment of flu patients” as per an advisory issued by the Union government. As flu, which is common during change of weather, has symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, the clinics will screen suspected covid cases and refer them to government hospitals.


Government hospitals will decide whether the referred patients should be put in isolation wards or in home quarantine, or be given treatment, said Haridwar district government hospital chief medical superintendent Rajesh Gupta to TOI on Tuesday. 

In a letter written on Tuesday to private hospitals in the district, CMO Saroj Naithani directed all private hospitals “to set up flu clinics and start free OPD service at these.” In case a clinic comes across a case of suspected Covid-19 infection, it should ensure that the case is immediately referred to the isolation ward of a government hospital so that their test samples are taken on time,” the letter said. “Once operational, flu clinics will reduce the present load on government hospitals and help them provide better service to suspected coronavirus cases,” Gupta said. He added that “some clinics might start functioning from Wednesday as a few of the private hospitals have already agreed to implement the direction.”

The CMO’s letter specified that “the clinics will operate as per guidelines mentioned in the government’s advisory.”
