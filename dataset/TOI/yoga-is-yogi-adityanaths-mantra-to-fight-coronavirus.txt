RISHIKESH: UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said deadly diseases like coronavirus can be eliminated by regularly practising yoga.


Inaugurating the week-long International Yog Festival in Rishikesh, Yogi said one who remains fit through yoga need not fear diseases like coronavirus. “The Indian tradition needs to be understood more deeply as it has tremendous things to offer through yoga. The world is waging a war against mental and physical illnesses. If these are cured, then no one will suffer from blood pressure, heart attack, kidney failure, liver failure or even coronavirus for that matter,” he added. 

Yogi claimed that Japanese encephalitis has gone down by 60% and mortality due to it dipped by 90% in the last two years. He said, “For the past 40 years, I have noticed that around 1,500 children of ages 1 to 15 die during the monsoon season due to encephalitis. Through my fight against the disease in Gorakhpur and eastern UP for the past 25 years, I have come to the conclusion that prevention is the only cure in such cases.”
