HYDERABAD: With the lockdown winding down and no respite in corona positive cases, ‘chota cops’ will soon be deployed by the police to ensure people are taking proper precautions to keep the virus at bay.

City police commissioner Anjani Kumar said that a novel concept of policing will be introduced to remind people about the need to maintain social distancing and wear a mask. He said through ‘chota cops’, police are planning to use the services of children. These kids would remind their parents, relatives and friends in the neighbourhood to take safety precautions.

“We have finalised the concept and will unveil it soon,” Anjani Kumar said at a webinar.
