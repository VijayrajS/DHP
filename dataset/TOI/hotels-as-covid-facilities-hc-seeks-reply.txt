Hotels as Covid-19 facilities: Delhi high court seeks reply
2020-06-10
NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday asked AAP government to explain under what authority the decision to convert hotels into extended Covid-19 facilities was taken. Justice Navin Chawla sought the government’s stand on petitions filed by two such hotels challenging the decision.


While one plea was filed last week by CHL Limited which owns Hotel Surya, another hotel named in the government order—Crown Plaza also approached the court. The matter will be heard on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, appearing for AAP government, told HC that all actions have been taken from powers vested under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act and maintained there is no illegality in the official decision of May 29 order.

The government said the purpose of converting them into extended Covid-19 hospitals is that medical services shall be provided by the attached private hospitals by admitting coronavirus positive patients as per their medical condition in the hotels.

Hotel Surya was directed to be requisitioned and handed over to the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital for converting it into an extended Covid-19 hospital. The government had also decided the rates payable by each patient on each night stay. Seeking a stay on the Delhi government’s order, the plea said the government had fixed the fees without consulting it.

“They should have discussed the future course of action with stakeholders, as it would affect the business,” it added.
