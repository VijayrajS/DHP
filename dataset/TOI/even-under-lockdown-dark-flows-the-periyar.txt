Even under lockdown, dark flows the Periyar
2020-04-20
Kochi: While air quality in the city has improved remarkably in the lockdown period, it does not seem to have made any impact in the Eloor-Edayar stretch of the Periyar river which continues to witness fish death and change in colour due to discharge of effluents.

On Friday, environment activists lodged a complaint with the officials of the state pollution control board after they spotted discolouration in the river. According to them, some of the companies are active and were releasing effluents into the river. On Saturday, inky black fluid flowed into the river after the irrigation department opened the Pathalam regulator, sparking fears of more fish death.

“The residents, environmental activists and everyone here are at their wits end. It is absolutely maddening that despite years of activism and hardships faced by people because of river pollution, the PCB has not been able to stop the damage being done to the river,” said Mohanan, an environmental activist.

The PCB had asked the irrigation department to maintain average lean flow in the river after their tests found extremely low-levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) downstream.

“In the last one-and-a-half months, the stretch witnessed several incidents of fish death. Some people have now made a business out of selling these fish,” said Mohanan.

The District Industries Centre has allowed the functioning of 240 units in Ernakulam district after March 31, following an order from the district collector. These units are engaged in sectors like food and agriculture, oleoresin, packaging and manufacture of soaps, sanitisers, masks and medical equipment.

But the PCB has currently suspended onsite visits to the lockdown regulations and would resume the same after April 24. “We do make site visits and collect samples if there is a complaint,” said a senior PCB official.
