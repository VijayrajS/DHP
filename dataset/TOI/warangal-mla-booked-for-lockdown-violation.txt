2020-05-21
WARANGAL: Warangal East MLA Nannapaneni Narendar was on Wednesday booked for violating lockdown norms while distributing groceries to people from 25 divisions of his constituency. 


BJP urban district vice president B Harishankar lodged a complaint against the ruling party MLA alleging that he had not maintained social distancing during the distribution which saw the presence of 3,000 people at Deshaipet. 

The MLA submitted the photographs of people sitting in rows and not maintaining social distancing in violation of Covid-19 norms issued by the Centre and states. The BJP leader demanded that police take stringent action against the organisers of the event and the people who gathered for essentials.

Speaking to TOI, Harishankar said the government had registered a case against Karimnagar MP B Sanjay when he visited an orange garden with ten activists. He said that the GWMC mayor was also at the gathering that had allegedly violated rules. TRS party sources claimed that while Narendar distributed groceries, he did so without violating norms. A case has been registered against the MLA, ACP Pratap said
