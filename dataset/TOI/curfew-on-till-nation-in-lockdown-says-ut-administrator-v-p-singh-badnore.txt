CHANDIGARH: The curfew in Chandigarh will continue as long as the nation remains under lockdown, according to UT administrator V P Singh Badnore on Saturday.


Badnore, who attended the video-conferencing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said, “It is heartening to know that Chandigarh has fared well in the first phase of curfew. The curfew in Chandigarh will continue as long as the lockdown in the country continues.”

 

He directed UT adviser Manoj Parida to formulate a scheme for utilising the services of idle workers in the second phase of curfew, and said farmers going for harvesting and marketing of their produces should be facilitated.

The administrator asked the education department to devise a mechanism for 40 book stores of Chandigarh to deliver books to homes of students during the curfew, a press statement from the administration said.

Badnore directed the adviser to ensure that all students from north-east, Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir are taken care of in the city.

Badnore also launched a new mobile application developed by the IT department of Chandigarh to track quarantine patients.

The development comes at a time when state governments through India have asked the central government to extend its lockdown beyond April 14 to stem the spread of coronavirus. Chandigarh’s Covid-19 tally stands at 19. The administration ordered curfew in the UT on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a nationwide lockdown. Punjab has already announced it was extending curfew restrictions in the state until May 1.

Earlier, Chandigarh was considering a staggered opening. However, the authorities had made clear that the final call would be taken after consulting the Centre.
