Set up testing facilities at Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli: Bombay HC
2020-03-24
NAGPUR: Expressing concern over alarming rise in the number of coronavirus cases across the state, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday issued a string of directives to contain the epidemic.


Pointing out that Covid-19 cases were also found at Yavatmal, Chandrapur, and Gadchiroli, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote sternly directed the government to establish VRDL testing facilities at these places.

“NMC and collector’s reply show that government has approved VRDL facility at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) at Akola and Nagpur. Considering the statistical reports, such facilities must also be set up in other places in Vidarbha. We direct the state to take necessary steps for creation of these facilities within two weeks.”

While hearing a plea by CH Sharma and others regarding inadequate facilities at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), where Anup Gilda was appointed amicus curiae, the HC adjourned hearing till April 7. It was clubbed with another PIL by businessman Subhash Zanwar through counsel Ram Heda.

After it was pointed out that there was a lack of isolation wards in Central Jail here, the bench asked the government to make arrangements for setting up the facility across all prisons in Vidarbha in a week. “We also direct the state to ensure thermal screening of all passengers arriving on domestic flights at Nagpur airport until the situation improves.”

Acknowledging that Covid-19 could spread alarmingly after crossing second stage, the judges advised authorities and citizens to take care and exercise prevention. “One of the steps could be enforcing social distancing. The police commissioner and collector have already prohibited assembly of five persons. However, such orders wouldn’t be enough. Both need to consider if movement of even a single person and vehicle on public roads/places could be prohibited, which would go a long way in preventing community spread.”

Earlier, senior counsel Jugalkishor Gilda pointed out that the centre hasn’t granted approval to any private laboratory to test coronavirus swab samples.

Quoting Dhruv Laboratory, which is equipped with Covid-19 testing kit, he said the tests conducted by private laboratories are costly at about Rs9,000, but those who can afford should be diverted there to reduce the burden on government facilities. “We direct Centre and state to consider granting approval and registration to private laboratories across Maharashtra which fulfil norms, within a week,” the judges said.

On a news report that a suspected woman patient from Hindustan Colony was turned away by GMC authorities since she had no history of foreign travel, the HC directed respondents to verify the case and take action.
