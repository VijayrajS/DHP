Ludhiana: With cases of coronavirus rising, the health department has deferred the decision to shift OPD and emergency services back to the Ludhiana civil hospital, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga informed during a function organized by ITBP to encourage frontline workers at the hospital on Saturday.

Earlier, the health department has decided to convert Covid-19 wing at the civil hospital into an OPD, but now again all Covid-19 treatment will continue at the hospital.

Dr Bagga said, “The health department has taken note of the fact that more than 1,200 passengers are deboarding in Ludhiana and most of them are commuting from high-risk states which have seen very high number of cases. So, our main focus is screening of these travellers. Thus, we need space and we have all the facilities operational at the civil hospital.”

He said, “We would seek the help of police officials if we open OPD services here. But for now, OPDs will continue at ESIC.”
