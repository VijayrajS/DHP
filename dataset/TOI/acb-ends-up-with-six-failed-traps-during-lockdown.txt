2020-05-14
Aurangabad: The Aurangabad unit of anti-corruption bureau (ACB) — having jurisdiction in four of the eight districts of Marathwada — has ended with up over six non-materialised traps (NMTs) during the current lockdown period.On analysing the high number of NMTs, the ACB realised that policemen deployed at check posts for examining every vehicle appeared to have played spoil sport. Four NMTs have been recorded in Aurangabad, while one each in Beed and Jalna. As per ACB sources, all these traps were important as they would have exposed the government employees trying to exploit people during the lockdown.In the past few days, the ACB tried changing the routes to reach some destinations, but still the government offices had somehow been alerted.Superintendent of police (ACB) Arvind Chawria confirmed the same and said so as to maintain secrecy of the pre-trap verifications and the actual traps, the ACB teams change their appearance and move in private vehicles, which alike other vehicles are stopped at every police check post they pass.Chawria told TOI, “So as to get clear of the checkposts and nakabandi points during the current lockdown, our team is forced to disclose their identity. As soon as they do it, the men deployed at the check posts learn that the ACB team is out for action, and we suspect that they alert government offices in the direction our teams are heading.”The officer said that they are trying to find out such elements in the police and revenue department, "Anyone found committing such mischief, will definitely face the heat," warned Chawria. It has also been found that even the deserted government offices, market places and roads are working to the advantage of the public servants allegedly seeking bribe. “The moment a government pancha accompanies the complainant during verification, the suspect government employee seeking bribe amount gets alerted and avoids interacting. Also, due to deserted offices and public places, trap teams despite changing their appearance, are easily getting spotted,” another senior ACB officer said.“Several government employees maintain a close rapport with toll plaza staff, tea stalls outside government offices for keeping an eye on the movement of ACB. As soon as an ACB vehicle passes the toll plaza or is spotted at a government office, the government departments get an alert,” said he added.
