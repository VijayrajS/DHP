Ganjam ramps ups infra to deal with coronavirus fallout
2020-03-28
BERHAMPUR: As migrant labourers troop back home in Ganjam district from coronavirus-hit states following the nationwide lockdown, the state government has decided to temporally reserve around 300 to 500 beds with ICU facilities for those who might show symptoms of coronavirus.


The district administration has identified the Tata Memorial Hospital at Sitalapalli, a newly constructed hospital building at Hinjili, the Chhatrapur Science College and the Women’s College in Bhanjanagar to turn them into care units to accommodate patients in case of their numbers increase.

“Besides, as many as 274 beds have been exclusively reserved for Covid-19 patients in the existing government-run hospitals,” chief district medical officer (CDMO) R Jagadeesh Patnaik said.

He, however, said no positive case was found in the district so far. “At least 15 people, who have been admitted in the isolation ward at MKCG Medical College and Hospital, have tested negative for novel coronavirus,” MKCG superintendent S K Mishra said.

On Friday, one person suspecting to be infected was admitted for treatment, he added.

Mishra said following instructions from the government, a meeting was held with MKCG faculty members to prepare duty charts among the doctors, including post-graduate students to attend to virus suspect patients.
