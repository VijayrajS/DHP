2020-04-22
Mysuru: Medical education minister Dr D Sudhakar indicated on Tuesday that the government is planning to lift the lockdown at Nanjangud, pointing out that only the results of 100 samples from those quarantined are pending.

 He said they have already tested 2,098 cases arising out of the outbreak at Jubilant Generics, including its employees. Nanjangud is under complete lockdown with only one entry and exit point open for movement of essential goods since March 27, a day after it reported Karnataka’s first ‘cluster case.’ 

While lockdown restrictions are in place like in rest of the country, the authorities have sealed layouts completely, supplying essential commodities to the residents at their doorsteps. Severe restrictions, which mainly ensured that the outbreak is contained at the temple town without allowing it to spill over to neighbouring Mysuru, which has 10 lakh population, were placed for 14 days of quarantine, which ended in mid-April but the district administration continued it as a precautionary measure.

He said the home department is trying to locate the source of the virus at Jubilant Generics and asserted that it will speak about it. He said P-52, who is believed to be patient zero, has not travelled outside the country.

Sudhakar along with district incharge minister S T Somashekar visited the pharma plant at Nanjangud and also met villagers of Kugulur, 20 kilometre from the temple town, which is also sealed as it has one positive case.
