VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh recorded its highest single day spike in Covid-19 cases with 210 new infections on Saturday, taking the cumulative tally to 4,460. 


It is for the first time that AP has reported more than 200 Covid-19 cases in a single day. No deaths were reported on Saturday.

Foreign returnees, people coming in from other states and Koyambedu-linked infections have contributed to nearly 1,100 cases in the state. There are currently 1,786 active cases in Andhra Pradesh, with 2,601 recoveries and 73 deaths. The state tested 12,771 samples between 9 am on Friday and 9 am on Saturday, the highest single day tests.

While the Covid-19 outbreak was predominantly limited to the urban areas of AP until about a month ago, rural areas of Andhra have also started witnessing a spike in the cases in the last few weeks. The outbreak in East Godavari continued to surge despite the strict containment measures. The super-spreader related cases further increased to 123 in Pedpapudi mandal alone.

The Covid-19 cases have spread to several new mandals in the last two days in East Godavari, including Gollaprolu, Ainavaili, Anaparthi, Rayavaram and Gandepalli. Similar is the case in Guntur district, with new cases surfacing in Bapatla, Vinukonda and Rajupalem mandals.

In Visakhapatnam district, Anakapalli has been virtually sealed after 14 cases reported from the town on Saturday. After Guntur and Kurnool, Krishna district also crossed the 500 cases mark. Cases continued to increase even in Vizianagaram district, with it now touching the half century mark. West Godavari is also not an exception as the district is witnessing a wave of infections in new mandals.

Meanwhile, seven flights have arrived in Vizag and five in Vijayawada since May 19, airlifting Indians stranded in foreign countries following the suspension of all commercial flights about two months ago. While 882 foreign returnees reached Vizag in these flights, Vijayawada airport saw 802 foreign returnees.
