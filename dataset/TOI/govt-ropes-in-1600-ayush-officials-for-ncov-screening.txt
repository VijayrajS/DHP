Government ropes in 1,600 Ayush officials for Covid-19 screening
2020-04-10
KOLKATA: Around 1,600 Ayush medical officials have been engaged in the government-run quarantine centres across the state to meet the requirement of increased workforce as the number of Covid-19 suspects is going up. 


The officials are Ayurveda, homoeopathy and Unani specialists. Around 80% of the officials were recruited from homeopathy while 15% from Ayurveda and 5% from Unani. Sources said that around 49 Ayush medical officials have been engaged at the quarantine centre of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute at Rajarhat. However, the medical officials, roped in by the government as contractual employees, belong to the Rastriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) scheme under the national health mission (NHM), which monitors the health of school-goers, especially the children at various Anganwadi centres in districts. The officials are assisting doctors and nurses to screen Covid-19 suspects coming to the quarantine centres with symptoms like fever and cough. They are working in three shifts such as morning, afternoon and night.

According to sources, the medical officials at some quarantine centres are being asked to conduct specialized jobs like collecting blood samples of throat swabs of Covid-19 suspects. “The Ayush medical officials are not meant for such specialized jobs that should be done by lab attendants having proper personal protective equipment. The officials should not be asked to conduct these jobs. If they come in direct contact with a Covid-19 positive patient, their life will be at risk,” said a medical practitioner. Sources said that the officials have been instructed to be on duty at the quarantine centres on a short notice, so they are not getting adequate training or guidelines to handle Covid-19 suspects. 

“Screening the suspects is a skilled job. It would have been helpful for them to get training before joining the quarantine centres,” said the practitioner.
