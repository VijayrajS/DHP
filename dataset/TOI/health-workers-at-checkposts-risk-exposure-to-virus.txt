Health workers at checkposts risk exposure to coronavirus in Panaji
2020-03-26
PANAJI: Frontline health workers posted at the Patradevi, Naibag and Kiranpani checkposts for screening coronavirus suspects have been left to fend for themselves after it was found that basic facilities such as hand sanitisers, masks, thermal scanners and drinking water have not been provided to them. 


The monitoring and advisory committee for Pernem taluka, that has been formed to oversee the implementation of the restrictions in view of the nationwide curfew, conducted an inspection of these areas on Tuesday. 

The committee informed the government there is an urgent need to provide health workers with thermal scanners at three checkposts, as they found to be using digital thermometers to record body temperatures. 

It has also been suggested that the staff be provided with basic requirements for their safety, including hand sanitisers. “There is a need to provide drinking water and washing facility - a wash basin, a small-sized water tank along with hand wash and soap, as police and health workers handle various documents and vehicle papers,” stated the committee in its report. The committee observed that health workers have been forced to make arrangements of hand sanitisers and masks at their end. 

During the inspection, the committee found that apart from locals, foreign nationals, including families with children who have decided to stay back due to the Covid-19 crisis, had defied the curfew and were spotted moving around in Mandrem, Ashvem, Keri, Ashvem, and Morjim. Few of them were also seen at the beaches. 

The committee advised the administration to instruct the Pernem motor vehicle inspector to strictly enforce the ban on rent-a-car.
