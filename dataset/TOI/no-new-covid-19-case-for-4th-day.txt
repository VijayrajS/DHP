COIMBATORE: There was no new Covid-19 case in the district for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday even as the state recorded another high volume of fresh cases.


The public health department said officials have been screening people in hospitals and containment areas. They have also collected samples from all the 28 truck drivers who returned to the district from Koyambedu in Chennai, the largest novel coronavirus cluster in the state, over the past 10 days.

While the district has reported 146 positive cares so far, there are only four active cases now. The public health department, which has tested 6,460 people for the novel coronavirus since March, said 1,623 of them were tested from May 3.

Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “We have been testing 300 to 400 samples a day since mid-April. In fact, we had tested 550 samples on May 4 alone. With the family members of positive patients testing negative for the virus, there is no reason to worry about the community spread.”

The district administration has, meanwhile, further tightened preventive measures at the 11 check posts in the district and issuance of e-passes. “We allow movement to and from Chennai only if it’s a medical emergency or if they are moving essential goods. We are strictly monitoring the people coming to the district from Chennai,” an official said.
