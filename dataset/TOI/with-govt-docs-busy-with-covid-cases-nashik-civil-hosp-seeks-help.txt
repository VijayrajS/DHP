2020-05-20
Nashik: Many doctors of the Nashik civil hospital are currently engaged in treating Covid-19 patients at the civil hospital and other parts of the district where covid facilities have been set up. As a result, the senior officers of the civil hospital are seeking services of doctors from other places. 

The Nashik civil hospital has 540 beds and has patients coming in from across the district and other places. However, since the Covid-19 outbreak, most doctors of the Nashik civil hospital have been shifted from one place to another to meet the requirements of coronavirus management.

Senior officials at the Nashik civil hospital said the bed occupancy had dropped to approximately 50% at the civil hospital in April due to the lockdown. However, after the partial relaxation in the lockdown from the first week of May, the flow of patients has started increasing and 75% of the beds are currently occupied. Officials said the civil hospital is in need of doctors.

Nashik civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale said: “We have written to the association of physicians to provide us with two physicians every day on a rotation basis as the two physicians with us are currently busy treating Covid-19 patients. We have also asked two surgeons (on a similar rotation basis) with the Nashik association of surgeons.” Apart from this, six MBBS doctors have been sought from the ESI hospital in Satpur. 

There are 202 doctors in the district working at the Nashik civil hospital, 6 sub-district hospitals and 28 rural hospitals.
