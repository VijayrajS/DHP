Meme on coronavirus
Featuring cartoon characters and famous Tamil comedian Vadivelu, the funny memes on coronavirus doing rounds have indeed kept the netizens free from panicking. Ever since the coronavirus has made it to the breaking news of news channels, meme creators have been working overtime to counterbalance the fear over the virus.

Soon after the novel coronavirus outbreak became global, meme makers were quick to respond by choosing humour to deal with the virus. Several memes were rolled out on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms using the templates of famous movie scenes, mostly featuring the comedian Vadivelu.

Meme makers were also early birds to target Nilavembu Kashayam (herbal drink) that was extensively used in the state to combat dengue fever. Most of the memes on coronavirus commonly conveyed that the deadly coronavirus will not enter the state fearing Nilavembu Kashayam.

“Through the memes, unwanted fear and panic are being allayed as people prefer to laugh and share the memes with friends. Many of our followers shared us that they feel relieved on seeing the funny memes on coronavirus,” a 30-year-old meme maker said.
