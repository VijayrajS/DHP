PANAJI: Continuing to use technology to combat the spread of Covid-19, the state introduced a mobile application to monitor quarantined individuals who could be asymptomatic carriers of the virus. 


Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the mobile app has been launched as a part of the state government’s initiative to ensure that more people do not get infected by the virus that has already killed 77 people and infected 3,374 people in India.

“In our initiative, health ministry has collaborated with Bangalore-based Intugine Technologies to launch COVIDLocator, a GPS-based location tracker that will help in tracking suspected and asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 when they leave their quarantine zone,” he said.

 The minister said that if a patient does not download the app, a reminder message will be sent. If the person ignores the reminder, a follow up call will be made by authorities to get the individual to download the app. For now, the app is available for download on the Google Play Store.
