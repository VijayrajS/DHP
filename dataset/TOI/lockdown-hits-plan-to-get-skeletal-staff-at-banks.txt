Lockdown hits plan to get skeletal staff at banks
2020-03-23
MUMBAI: Banks will be open for only essential services, such as cash and cheque deposits, cash withdrawal and government transactions. 


However, with the lockdown in 75 districts, senior bankers say that manning all branches, even with a skeletal staff, will pose challenges. 

State governments like Maharashtra have announced a lockdown except for essential services. So, banks are excluded as they come under essential services. Banks can only shut shop if the necessary orders are issued by the government under the 139-year-old Negotiable Instruments Act. 

A statement by the Indian Banks’ Association on basic services was issued before the government on Sunday announced a lockdown in 75 districts, including most of the metros. Bank officials say that in cities like Mumbai, getting staff to branches would be a challenge as most are dependent on public transport, which will be skeletal. 

Many branches are looking at getting employees to work in branches by rotation, although this will end up exposing all employees to risk. One branch manager said that employees who were at higher risk because of health conditions were allowed to stay at home. Some banks are looking at asking staff to report to the nearest branch. But even in such cases, the attendance will have to be in pairs as the core banking system follows a ‘maker’ and ‘checker’ system using biometric authentication. 

While no ‘work from home’ option has been extended to frontline staff, branch staff say that they fear exposure. Not all staff members are willing to take up the cashier function and some even fear that handling currency notes may not be hygienic.

Private banks are allowing personal bankers and relationship managers to work from home. While most banks provide ‘anywhere banking’, some customers were upset at being slapped with hefty charges for depositing cash in a ‘non-home’ branch.
