KANPUR: Nodal officer Anil Garg has directed the health authorities to go for pool sampling if corona positive cases are in bulk as this may help in finding out the reason in spread of deadly coronavirus.

The nodal officer, who is also chief executive officer of UPSIDA, at a meeting held with district administration, police and health officials on Wednesday, directed to go for pool sampling.

Divisional commissioner Sudhir M Bobde, who presided over the meeting, asked the officials to investigate the corona positive cases carefully. 

Police and the health department have been directed to trace record of a positive case separately and feed that data. The staff engaged in filling the CIF forms has been asked to take utmost care because they have to fill complete details of a positive patient in the form.

District magistrate Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari said that aluminum chamber or secured bus, whatever needed, would be provided for sample collection in the hotspot areas. DIG/SSP Anant Deo told the nodal officer that the police department was using surveillance system in tracking and tracing corona positive patients.

The commissioner directed the officials to run the Covid-19 lab at GSVM medical college with full steam. “All pending samples must be examined on a priority basis. Tracing and tracking any new positive case should be done on war footing”, he said.

Meanwhile, Covid-19 hospital of LLR hospital has been attached with e-system of the hospital for paperless work. As soon as any new positive case is admitted, the patient’s details would be feeded online.
