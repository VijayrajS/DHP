Madurai: Citing difficulties in getting return passes during the lockdown, a consumer rights NGO has written to the chief minister to issue directions to the district administrations to issue two-way passes, so that people who travel for emergencies can return to their destinations without any difficulty. Empower, the NGO, has stated that it had come across three instances where people who travelled from Chennai to Tuticorin and Tenkasi are finding it difficult to return. Sankar from the organisation stated that a couple who travelled to Tenkasi is stuck there while their children are in Chennai. “We tried reaching the Tuticorin district administration but an official said that passes can be given only for travel in case of emergencies such as wedding, death or medical emergencies and not for return travel. So, we request the government to make arrangement for issuance of two-way passes,” Sankar said.Meanwhile, for the family of S Kannan, 65, of Madurai who had gone to Coimbatore for a medical emergency before the lockdown, it was a smooth ride after the lockdown was enforced as they got a pass for their return journey to Madurai. The taxi, which they had hired to Madurai also managed to return to Coimbatore the same day without the need for another pass.
