MEERUT: People flocked vegetables markets, grocery shops and petrol pumps to stock essentials on the first day of lockdown imposed in 16 districts of UP, including Meerut. Barring the vegetable markets, grocery shops and other places where items of daily needs are sold, rest of the city wore a deserted look.


While several people, especially the youth, were also seen loitering on the roads.

This came even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Monday that people were not treating the lockdown seriously and the state government has been asked to take measures to see that the rules are followed.

Policemen were seen questing people about the motive of their outings. Over 50 vehicles were seized in west UP by the police on Monday.

Government offices also remained closed. Meerut’s regional transport officer Vijay Kumar, said, “All the services at the Regional Transport Office have been suspended. The services will resume only when the lockdown is over.”
