PUNE: The 50-year-old woman from Raviwar Peth — the second victim of Covid-19 — had no history of recent international travel or any proximity to known infected persons or their close contacts.

She succumbed to novel coronavirus (Covid-19) associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital on Thursday. The hospital’s dean, Ajay Chandanwale, said, “She had tested positive for the contagion when her throat swab was analysed at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved laboratory at our hospital. She had no history of foreign travel or known proximity to infected patients or their close contacts. The investigation is on.” 

The woman is the second confirmed death caused by Covid-19 induced complications in the city. On Monday (March 30), a 52-year-old man passed away at a private hospital. In both cases, there had been no history of recent international travel or any proximity to known infected persons or their close contacts.

Chandwale said, “The woman had no underlying medical conditions. She had been complaining of cough, fever and vomiting since March 23 and was seeking medical treatment from a neighbourhood doctor. Her condition kept worsening.” 

On Wednesday, the woman was rushed to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run Kamala Nehru Hospital in Mangalwar Peth after she complained of breathlessness. “Her chest X-ray showed patches of pneumonia on both sides of her lungs. She was referred to Sassoon hospital for tertiary care treatment the same day. She was put on non-invasive ventilator at our hospital to improve her respiratory distress,” Chandanwale said.

The woman was put on anti-viral medications and was being administered treatment as per the treatment protocol of ICMR. He condition deteriorated further and she succumbed around 8pm on Thursday.

The woman was staying at her brother’s house in Raviwar Peth for the past three years. She is survived by her married daughter.
