BENGALURU: Karnataka announced an intensified lockdown in nine districts affected by Covid-19 as the state recorded six more cases on Sunday — the highest in a day — taking the total to 26. The new measures include sealing borders with neighbouring states and screening domestic passengers arriving in Bengaluru and Mangaluru airports.


The intensified lockdown will be in force till March 31 in Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkaballapura, Dakshina Kannada, Mysuru, Kalaburagi, Dharwad, Kodagu and Belagavi districts. Though no positive case has been reported from Dakshina Kannada, the district faces restrictions as a man from Bhatkal (Uttara Kannada district) tested positive had arrived in Mangaluru from Dubai on March 19. Three fresh cases were from Bengaluru, and one each from Chikkaballapura, Dharwad and Uttara Kannada districts.

 
 
Essential services — pharmacies and grocery shops — will remain open. Industry has been told to operate with 50% staff strength; IT and BT firms will opt for work from home wherever possible.

After chairing a meeting of the task force, chief minister BS Yediyurappa appealed to the people to cooperate with the government to ensure peaceful closure of borders. Four of Karnataka’s six neighbours had closed borders. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were allowing people across the border.
