Nashik: The Nirbhaya squad of the city police commissionerate attended 26 distress calls from women, mainly regarding domestic violence, during the lockdown period, senior officers said.

Around two months ago, commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil had uploaded a video on social media warning Nashik residents of strict action if they were found indulging in domestic violence. The CP had brought to the notice of the people at large that the lockdown was increasing frustration among people at the domestic level while women and children were finding themselves at the receiving end.

PSI Neha Suryawanshi said that they received several calls regarding harassment. Either the victims themselves made the calls or people in their vicinity contacted the Nirbhaya squad and informed them about the harassment. 

Acting on the tip-offs or distress calls, the Nirbhaya teams immediately took action and warned the concerned people. Moreover, they also intimated the concerned police stations about the calls they had received from women in their respective areas.

Suryawanshi said that they also booked a large number of people who were found violating the lockdown norms by moving around in the city without wearing face masks. More than 700 people were booked by the Nirbhaya squads during the lockdown period.
