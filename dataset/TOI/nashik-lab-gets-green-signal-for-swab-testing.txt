Nashik: The Covid-19 testing laboratory at the Dr Vasantrao Medical College Hospital and Research Centre at Adgaon here has finally got the clearance and is expected to begin work on Tuesday. 

“We have got the clearance from the National Accreditation Board of Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and testing should start from tomorrow,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said on Monday. 

The staff at the laboratory has been trained by All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Nagpur, which has been appointed as mentor for the testing laboratory process by Indian Council of Medical Research. Sample testing was conducted in video conferencing, following which the approval was given.

The laboratory equipment required for the processes were contributed by Datar Genetics, while the college provided infrastructure and the manpower — microbiologist and technicians. 

The district administration coordinated for the construction of some section of the laboratory with the help of Public Works Department (PWD) and also in getting up to 3000 kits required for testing of swab samples. 

“The first batch of samples will be taken in on Tuesday morning, following which the process of testing will begin. We can conduct more than 70 tests simultaneously and one batch requires about 4.5 hours for yielding results,” another officer said. 

The laboratory will function for patients from Nashik district, thus reducing the chances of dependency on laboratories in other districts.

Currently, samples originating from Malegaon and Satana taluka are taken to the laboratory at Shree Bhausaheb Hiray Government Medical College Hospital, Dhule, which also tests samples from Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts.

The samples from rest of Nashik district go to the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune, which also receives samples from various other districts for testing.
