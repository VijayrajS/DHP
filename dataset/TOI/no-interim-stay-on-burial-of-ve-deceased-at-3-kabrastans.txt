No interim stay on burial of dead Covid-19 patients at 3 Mumbai kabrastans
2020-04-28
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday rejected a plea for urgent interim orders to restrain the BMC from allowing burial of dead Covid-19 patients at Navpada Konkani Muslim Cemetery, Khoja Sunnat Jamat Kabrastan and Khoja Isna Ashari Jamaat Kabrastan in Bandra (West).


Justice B P Colabawalla directed that burial can take place at these three cemeteries in Bandra (West) and that the BMC open their locks.

Pradeep Gandhy and a few other residents of Bandra had petitioned the HC against an April 9 BMC circular notifying names of Muslim cemeteries where dead Covid-19 patients could be buried. Their counsel Amogh Singh argued the circular was issued with “utter disregard” to the one issued on March 30 which said bodies be cremated at the “nearest crematorium”. He said the cemeteries are “interconnected’’ and right next to petitioners’ homes and they feared “community transmission”. When the trustees’ counsel Pratap Nimbalkar said the lock was placed by locals, Singh refuted it saying the petitioner is a lawyer and won’t go around putting locks on cemeteries.
