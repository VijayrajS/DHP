COIMBATORE: The 25-year-old Coimbatore native, who was admitted to the isolation ward of ESI hospital after he returned from Japan, has tested negative for coronavirus, public health officials said on Thursday.

The man, who was pursuing research in Japan, had landed in Chennai on February 26 and took a train to reach Coimbatore. After developing flu symptoms, he was admitted to the ESI hospital and was kept under surveillance. Swab samples were collected from him and sent to the King’s Institute in Chennai.

The tests showed that he was not affected by coronavirus. 

Subsequently he was discharged from the hospital on Thursday. However, the health officials have asked him to get home quarantined for 28 days and not to step out into public places.

Meanwhile, a 40-year-old man, who had returned from Japan on Wednesday, also tested negative for the virus, the officials said. “Both of them are stable. We have asked them to report to the health authorities if they develop further symptoms,” a health officer told TOI.

Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital dean K Ashokan said the hospital has taken all precautionary measures to treat patients with coronavirus symptoms. “A special ambulance for people with the symptoms has been kept ready and hospital staff have also been trained to handle such cases,” he said.
