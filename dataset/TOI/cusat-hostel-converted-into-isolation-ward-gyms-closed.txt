Covid-19 in Kerala: Cusat hostel converted into isolation ward, gyms closed
2020-03-15
KOCHI: The students hostel at Cusat has been converted into an isolation ward. Many gyms have closed operations for a few days. District authorities have started distribution of food kits to houses of those in home quarantine. Notices are seen plastered in front of many institutions saying they have been suspended until further notice. 

Food kits were distributed to houses of 173 people in quarantine on Saturday. This is being done with help of the local self-government.

This comes amid the growing threat of Covid-19 in the district. 

Agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar, who is in charge of the district, said they expect 200 more Malayalis to return to the state in the coming days. “Arrangements have been made to isolate people, who reach Kerala with symptoms of Covid-19. Around 250 rooms have been arranged at Government Ayurveda Hospital in Tripunithura and hostel in Cusat. We will arrange more facilities, if need arises,” he said after reviewing passenger-screening arrangements at Cial.

He said the four-layer screening of passengers landing at the airport is satisfactory. The service of health officials from Thrissur will also be ensured in Ernakulam. The service of a nodal officer is also being ensured to coordinate preventive measures being carried out by local bodies and police. The district administration said there is no need to use masks unnecessarily. People contacting the control room have complained that needless use of masks is leading to its shortage in the market.

Video-call facility is now available at the control room to facilitate those in home quarantine to speak to a doctor and discuss their health. Those looking to avail this service, which is available 24/7, must make a booking.
