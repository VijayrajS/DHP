Hyderabad: The families of 23 Indian seafarers, including nine from both Telugu states, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to rescue the stranded sailors from Barcelona, Spain. The seafarers were made to disembark their ship following the outbreak of Covid-19 but as flights were cancelled they have not been able to reach India.

Among the stranded seafarers are five each from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and others from Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Harayana and Maharashtra. “They are in dire need of help,” Capt Sanjay Prashar of Forum for Integrated National Security (FINS) said.

Sangeeta Bhagwan, who lives in Hyderabad, said her brother and other seafarers needed help to provide for their necessities and also for their repatriation. 

According to Sangeeta, they were offboarded from cruise ship Pullmantur Sovereign from the port of Malaga in Spain on March 21. Since there were no flights, they could not fly back to India.

“My aged mother is worried about the well-being of my brother just like the families in Spain, ,” she said. Sangeeta said the Indian embassy in Spain had responded positively. The embassy said it had spoken to the group and was in constant touch with their employer Pullmantur Cruceros who also confirmed their accommodation at the hotel till April 2. 

In a video message, the seafarers said they were stuck ‘in the middle of nowhere in corona-hit Spain’. “Please evacuate us from this situation. Please save us and save our lives,” one of the seafarers said. “We do not even have medication. We deserve to be in our country, not abandoned and scared,” they said.
