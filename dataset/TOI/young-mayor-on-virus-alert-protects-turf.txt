HYDERABAD: The youngest mayor in Telangana, 26-year-old Mekala Kavya, is not only depending on government resources but also pooling the efforts of her family to fight the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in Jawaharnagar municipality. Thankfully, Jawaharnagar has not reported a single case of Covid-19 in any of the 28 divisions in the municipality.


“This is precisely the reason why we are working extra hard to see that Covid-19 does not spread in our area,” Kavya told TOI. An engineering graduate in IT, Kavya found herself in the thick of politics during the municipal elections. In January this year, she was elected as a mayor in the seat which was reserved for women.

In the fight against Covid-19, the first thing she did was to get on to the road and spray disinfectants. Her father Mekala Ayyappa, who has been in politics and been a social worker, decided to lend a helping hand to his daughter. Her elder brother Bhargav, a builder, and her younger brother Jagapathi, an architect, have all stood with Kavya to reach out to the needy in Jawaharnagar.

“We are aware of the fact that government resources are limited. We, as a family, felt we should first do as much as we can with our own money to help people in distress in our municipality,” Kavya said. The family has spent Rs 20 lakh to supply essential commodities to the poor and needy. 

Irrespective of which party they belonged to, the TRS mayor involved all the corporators. Her father donated 300 tonnes of rice in addition to providing 200 packets of vegetables. Looking at the involvement of the entire family, children in the neighboured brought in their kiddy bank savings for buying 150 kg of rice for distribution.
