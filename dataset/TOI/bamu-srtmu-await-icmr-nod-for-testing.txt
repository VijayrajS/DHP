2020-04-09
AURANGABAD: The Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (BAMU), Aurangabad, and the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU), Nanded, have submitted separate proposals to set up testing facilities for Covid-19. 


These proposals have been sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) through the state government and the approval is expected shortly.

If approved, the number of testing facilities for coronavirus in Marathwada will increase to three. At present, the swab samples taken in Latur and Osmanabad are sent to Solapur for testing, while those of the remaining six districts are tested at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad. The government had announced it would set up a testing laboratory in Latur, but this has not materialised.

SRTMU public relations officer Ashok Kadam on Wednesday said that the university has a state-of-the-art incubation centre where the university proposes to set up the Covid-19 testing facility. “The incubation centre had received a grant of Rs 5 crore under the central programme of the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan and houses state-of-the-art infrastructe,” he said.
