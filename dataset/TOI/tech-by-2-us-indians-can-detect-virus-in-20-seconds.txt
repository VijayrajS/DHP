HYDERABAD: Lack of sufficient testing kits is proving to be a great stumbling block in the fight against coronavirus.

To help the world fight the pandemic on a war footing, two Indian Americans have come up with an AI-powered advanced diagnostic system which will help in quick detection of the Covid-19 virus. 

 


Barath Narayanan

Hyderabad’s Srikanth Kodeboyina and Chennai’s Barath Narayanan, who had gone to the US to pursue higher studies, are on the brink of providing the world a tool which is needed urgently. Srikanth is president and CEO of Blue Eye Soft, a Greenville SC based IT software solutions company, while Barath is a research scientist at the University of Dayton Research Institute and Adjunct faculty at University of Dayton.

The software developed by Narayanan uses a deep learning algorithm that searches for markings on X-rays that indicate the presence of Covid-19. According to the University of Dalton, the software that Barath came up with has been exclusively licensed to Blue Eye Soft.

Srikanth describes the diagnostic system as something that will identify the presence of the virus in 20 seconds with 96% accuracy, as of now. “I am now rushing on an FDA approval process,” Srikanth told TOI from US. “Every life matters, so for the next few days, I am focussed on getting necessary certification from international boards,” he said. “I will be thrilled once FDA approval comes,” Barath told TOI.
