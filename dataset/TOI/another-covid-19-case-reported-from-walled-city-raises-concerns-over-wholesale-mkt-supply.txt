Bhopal: The walled-city area, Azad Market/Jumerati, the state capital’s wholesale and retail market hub, reported one more COVID-19 positive case here on Monday. Only recently, the market was allowed to open after nearly a two-week lockdown.“We are closely monitoring the situation,” said Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Tiwari in reference to another positive case in the business hub. Earlier, cases have been reported from nearby areas in the walled city. However, cases in the walled city have been relatively low compared to other densely populated areas like Jehangirabad, Aishbagh and others.Entry of customers for shopping from the outlets has been prohibited. Dozens of vehicles, which load tonnes of food to be supplied across the city and the district, line up along Safia college road as a token system for the vehicles has been implemented. More than two dozen policemen were deployed in the area on Monday. The news of a patient in his late 70s, who was diagnosed with COVID-19, had not reached the area till Monday afternoon. He was admitted after testing positive for dengue fever. The patient is said to be in stable condition, said an AIIMS-Bhopal official.“We are getting orders on WhatsApp or through mobile. We can deliver only food items through home delivery,” said Piyush Dubey, a shopkeeper in Jumerati market. Only a handful of grocery stores are open in the area. The deserted looking market is more busy in the bylanes. Many of the godowns are in the semi-residential area. “The situation is not normalised yet. We deliver orders only within a 2 km radius, as directed by the district administration,” said Mayank Gupta, a shopkeeper.
