Nagpur: The global outbreak of Covid-19 may have led to a major upheaval in the fate of the nations affected by the virus, including India, but the routine anti-Maoist operations of the elite C-60 commandos of the Gadchiroli police did not change a bit even when they too are not out of its pervasive threat.

The operations were also strategically streamlined and strengthened as a precaution after the latest attack on the security forces by the Maoists leading to the deaths of 17 jawans.

Gadchiroli police, apart from its crucial border sealing exercises with Chhattisgarh and Telangana, are also continuing its anti-Maoist operations on a regular basis whether input-based or random area domination exercises or short and long range patrolling along with community programmes like ‘grambhets’ or village visits.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said operations cannot be discontinued or scaled down as the Maoists will regain ground or regroup. “Precautions are being taken to ensure that there are no incidents of infection or its spread. The jawans are screened for their health and if someone is found ill then he is rested,” said Balkawade. The SP said every patrolling party has a medical kit.

Balkawade said that if any personnel or jawan of the state reserve police force or central paramilitary force is found ill with a cold or cough then he or she is immediately quarantined.

“If we find that any jawan is not keeping well after travel or upon returning from leave then we are following a policy of immediately quarantining him or her,” said the SP.
