Gujarat: Fracture can’t break this cop’s zest to fight Covid-19

RAJKOT: His hand was fractured after he fell off his bike. He was advised rest for one and a half month. But as soon as yet another Covid-19 positive case came to light, Bhupatsinh Parmar, a constable with Veraval city police station of Gir Somnath district, resumed within 24 hours of the mishap.


"Taking a serious note of the current situation, I felt called upon to resume my duty. When a yet another case of Covid-19 positive patient came to my notice, I asked my senior officer to deploy me at a checkpost," Parmar told reporters. 

Parmar, who serves as a driver of the police jeep, has been deployed at a checkpost at the entry point to Veraval city, as he cannot drive with a fractured hand. 

"I requested Veraval city police inspector to allot me duty at some fixed point since I won't be able to drive for a month-and-a-half. Already, there are two positive case in Veraval and I thought I would be running away from my responsibility by staying at home in these challenging times," said Parmar.

Amit Vasava, assistant superintendent of police, Gir-Somnath, said, "Parmar's commitment to work in such testing times is commendable and we are proud of him. Despite being advised rest at home for a month-and-a-half, he has preferred joining duty just a day after the accident.” 

Vasava added that police are working tirelessly to ensure a complete lockdown to defeat the coronavirus pandemic. “We appeal to people that they should take inspiration from Parmar and cooperate with us by staying at home," the ASP added.
