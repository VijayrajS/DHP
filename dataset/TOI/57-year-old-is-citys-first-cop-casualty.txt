2020-04-26
MUMBAI: A 57-year-old constable died of Covid-19 on Saturday afternoon—the first among Mumbai police personnel to die of the disease. The constable’s Worli residence is located near an area that has been declared a ‘containment zone’, said sources. Until Saturday, 96 state police personnel had tested positive Covid. 

The deceased cop’s wife, two sons and a daughter have been quarantined and will undergo tests, said a senior police officer.

The constable had been posted at Vakola police station and was assigned desk duty recently, considering his vulnerability due to age. 

As he was running a temperature, he was admitted to Nair Hospital on Wednesday where he tested positive.

The officer said one of his three close colleagues has also tested positive and has been admitted to a hospital. The other two have been quarantined at home, but have not shown any symptoms so far.

Police sources claimed that the constable could have contracted the virus around his residence. 

The deceased cop, who hails from the Konkan region, had joined the police force in 1988 and. He had been serving at Vakola police station since 2015.

Last week, he informed his seniors that he had a fever. Civic officers were immediately informed and the constable was taken to hospital. He passed away in hospital around 3.30pm.

Deputy commissioner of police Manjunath Shinge said they have devised a rota by which every staffer works for 12 hours and then gets the next 24 hours off to rest. “This is very important for their physical and emotional well-being,” he said.
