Dehradun: The state health department on Friday quarantined doctors and medical staff, who checked the recently-diagnosed coronavirus- positive patient from Kotdwar, as they were not wearing any protection kits.

Talking to TOI, a senior official from the office of director general (DG) health, confirmed that three doctors, four staff nurses and two ward boys from Base Hospital in Kotdwar were quarantined after they checked the 26-year-old patient, who had returned from Spain and was admitted to the general isolation ward.

“As the patient wasn’t showing any symptoms of coronavirus and was admitted here only because of travel history, the doctors neglected the personal protection kits. After he was diagnosed as a positive case, the people who came in his contact were quarantined,” said the official.
