CM ignoring spurt in Covid cases: Telangana Congress
2020-05-31
HYDERABAD: Expressing serious concern over the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the state, Telangana Congress treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy said that the chief minister is busy with inaugurations, poojas and yagnams rather than focusing on containing the pandemic.


“KCR violated the physical distancing norms and no one was wearing a mask during the inauguration of Konda Pochamma Sagar project on Friday. With the CM not wearing mask and not maintaining physical distance, a wrong message has gone to the people that Covid-19 scare was no more relevant,” he said.

Stating that the actual numbers could be much higher if the state increases the testing percentage and permits private labs to conduct tests, Narayana Reddy demanded that the state government should immediately appoint a senior epidemiologist to advise the CM.
