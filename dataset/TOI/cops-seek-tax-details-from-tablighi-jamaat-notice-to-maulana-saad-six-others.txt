Delhi cops seek tax details from Tablighi Jamaat
2020-04-04
NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has issued a notice to seven members of the Tablighi Jamaat core committee, including Maulana Saad Kandhalvi, asking them to report the source of funding for the Alami Markaz, its headquarters at Nizamuddin. The police have sought the organisation’s tax details, PAN and bank account statements of the past three years.


Markaz head Saad and the six others have also been asked to send the lists of foreigners and Indians who attended the religious congregation between March 11 and 13. 

The police teams looking for the seven members have been told to take precautionary measures before entering any premises used by them as it’s suspected that they too may have shown signs of Covid-19. 

The members have been asked to clarify if they had sought any permission from a government authority to hold the gathering, if they were issued any written guideline for the event, and if the Alami Markaz authorities had any other correspondence with the administration. They will also have to submit the number of committee members and the list of employees working for the organisation. 

Police also want the number of gatherings organised between January 1 and April 1, a map or site plan and the number of CCTV cameras on the premises. Besides the audio or video recording of all participants after March 12, the original register with the record of all attendees are to be submitted too. The information about parking attendants and volunteers present after March 12 will also have to be provided. 

Saad and his core committee members will also have to report if any devotee fell sick during the programme and the steps taken to evacuate the Alami Markaz, especially the measures that followed the announcement of the nationwide lockdown. 

A date-wise report has also been sought on inmates who were taken to hospital after March 12. Police are also trying to find out how many inmates were taken to other mosques or houses in Delhi after it became clear that several people had fallen sick.

The members will also report about the curfew passes obtained by the organisation and the government officials who visited the premises after March 12.
