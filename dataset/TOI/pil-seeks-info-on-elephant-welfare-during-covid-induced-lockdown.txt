2020-06-02
Jaipur: A division bench of Rajasthan High Court on Monday asked the state government to explain steps taken to save elephants during lockdown. The interim response was sought by the court from the chief secretary, Jaipur collector and principal chief wildlife conservator. The bench comprising Justice Govardhan Bardhar and Justice CK Songara gave the instructions while hearing a public interest litigation filed by Gopal Singh Bareth saying the pachyderms were not adequately treated in elephant village during the epidemic. The PIL said elephants were declared a national heritage animal in 2010. “In the same year the elephant village was established in Amber to provide shelter and other facilities including water to them. There are around 51 mahawat families and 103 elephants living there. Amber is the only heritage site in the world where elephants ride. “However, due to the lockdown, the state government has not made any announcement for protection of wildlife especially elephants. It needs around Rs 3,000 to maintain an elephant per day, while mahawat are being given only Rs 600. Also the prices of sugarcane and jawar have doubled during lockdown. Therefore, amount given to elephants should be increased,” petitioner said.
