Chandigarh: The Covid-19 count touched 301 in the city on Tuesday, with four cases, including a death.

Three cases were reported from Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26 and the death from containment zone of Sector 30 B. The colony patients are a 35-year-old man, a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old man. All of them are family contacts of a Covid-19 patient who delivered a baby in Manimajra on Monday.

The recovery rate in the city is 73%. “The active cases are 82. We are following protocols of testing as per the central government,” said Arun Gupta, health secretary, UT.

On the contrary, public health experts said these numbers should be taken seriously. “For a city like Chandigarh, reaching this figure is unbelievable. Due to the revised discharged policy, active cases have declined, otherwise they would have spiked,” said an epidemiologist in PGI.

As many as 4,902 samples have been tested in the city. The results of 27 samples are awaited. A passenger who travelled in a Shramik Special train from Una to Delhi was among the tested. “Medical screening at the railway station revealed he had fever. He was taken to Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16. His report is expected soon,” said an official.

Samples of a UT administration employee who had fever for the last few days were given for testing on Tuesday. He works in the urban planning department as a junior assistant. The office was sanitised on Tuesday as a preventive step.
