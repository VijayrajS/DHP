NASHIK: Sinnar taluka is turning into a new hotspot for Covid-19 with one fresh case registered on Sunday, taking the total number of active cases to 22. The taluka has registered 32 patients so far.


Of these 32 patients, 22 are active cases while the rest have been discharged after recovery. The taluka is leading in the number of active Covid-19 cases. Yeola, which once had 31 active patients, has currently reported only 10 active cases. 

Sinnar town had reported only two Covid-19 patients — both having recovered from the contagion — while the rest belong to rural areas.

“Many people from Sinnar taluka are working in different parts of Mumbai. Most of the cases in the taluka have Mumbai connection,” health authorities said. 

While the first two cases registered in Sinna taluka had Malegaon connection, the recent eight cases that have infected more than 13 people so far are linked to Mumbai.

“Those working in various parts of Mumbai returned to their hometown in SInnar taluka. Some might have contracted the infection in Mumbai and later passed it on to their family members, health authorities said.
