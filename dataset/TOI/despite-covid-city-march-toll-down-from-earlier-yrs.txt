Despite Covid-19, Mumbai March toll down from earlier years
2020-04-26
MUMBAI: The Covid-19 outbreak has claimed 191 lives in the city and affected 5,049 Mumbaikars so far, but the BMC on Saturday produced data to show how the viral infection has not pushed northwards the death graph for this time of the year.





If at all, the number of deaths and other related statistics have registered a drop, said BMC officials.

In one data set, it was seen deaths in cases harbouring chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart problems registered a dip of almost 36% this March compared to the same month in previous years. Diabetes, hypertension and heart problems can be life-threatening when the patient contracts another disease like Covid-19.In March 2017, there were 729 deaths owing to some of these co-morbidities, in March 2018 the number was 883 deaths, and in March 2019 it was 937. This March, the number of deaths dipped to 595.

After widespread criticism of the healthcare infrastructure for the death of Covid-19 patients within 24 hours of admission, BMC officials also dug out data on deaths in the April 14 to April 21 period over the last few years. While there were 99 deaths within 24 hours of admission in 2018, the figure was 92 in 2019 and 90 this year. 

The BMC officials said that the figures showed Covid-19 had not worsened the death statistics in the city so far.

The death analysis also showed that 62% of the total patients expired within three days of admission, while 30% of fatalities were from the low-income group and 32% were among people living in chawls.

In a meeting held recently, it was mentioned that mortality rate was high due to patients reporting late to hospitals.

“Therefore, in the current situation, potentially vulnerable people will be screened by trained teams from the BMC, who will visit door-to-door with an oximeter (to measure oxygen concentration) and conduct a scan using a portable X-ray machine and suspected patients can then be shifted into the necessary healthcare facility,” a civic official said.

Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said that considering the projections that have been made of the increase in number of Covid-19 cases by the end of May, they were working towards ramping up their facilities as well.

“We have had discussions about it, and on how Mumbai’s death rate has been low despite Covid-19, with the central team last week. Steps with regard to these are being taken,” he said
