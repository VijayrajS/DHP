Coimbatore: Suppose, you go out without wearing mask. Suppose, police stop you and force you to board an ambulance in which a Covid-19 patient is lying. How will you react? You will plead with cops to let you leave the ambulance. But they won’t. You will try to escape through the side windows. Your panicky reaction will be a stuff of comedy soon.This same situation is presented in a Covid-19 awareness video released by the Tirupur police in Tamil Nadu. The video shows cops stopping five youths, riding on two motorcycles, for not wearing masks.A woman inspector asks three youths on a bike what would happen if they are not wearing masks. Two sub-inspectors of police force them to board an ambulance. Once they board the ambulance, a ‘Covid-19 patient’ is shown lying in the vehicle. On seeing the ‘patient’, the youths attempt to escape through side windows. They pleaded with the cops to let them go. It becomes hilarious.At the end of the video, Palladam police inspector (incharge) G Palaniammal is head requesting the general public to stay indoors and wear masks when they go out.The video, running three minutes and 51 seconds, was uploaded on YouTube by the social media unit of the Tirupur district police. It was widely circulated on social media and instant messaging apps. “This video will help curtail the movement of the public. Volunteers from Palladam acted in the video,” said Tirupur superintendent of police Disha Mittal.
