2020-03-23
INDORE: The 14-hour long ‘Janta Curfew’ on Sunday gave Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) an opportunity to carry out an extensive sanitisation drive in all areas of city. A team of some 500 staff and officials were pressed into service to carry out the mega sanitisation activity that started from early morning. All major roads, footpaths, ATMs, commercial outlets and parking lots that come in direct contact of people were thoroughly cleaned up and sanitised with the help of disinfectants. 

The civic body also took help of two drones for spraying biological sanitiser on landmark areas of all 19 zones such as MY Hospital, high court tri-circle, Regal square, Rajwada, Vijay Nagar, Patnipura, Radisson square and Mhow Naka among others. 

IMC additional commissioner Rajneesh Kasera said that the ‘Janta Curfew’ gave them an opportunity to carry out extensive sanitisation drive across city in absence of vehicular and pedestrian movement. 

“We had divided the drive in three parts- use of disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite during day hours, spraying of biological sanitiser with help of drones at landmark locations and use of fogging machines in densely populated areas during night hours to maintain hygiene,” he said. “Other tasks like road sweeping and waste collection work also went smoothly in absence of traffic and pedestrian movement,” he added. 

IMC health department officials said that the drive will continue in near future to contain Covid-19. “As many as 200 manual sprayers and four tractors were also pressed in service to carry out the drive,” IMC health officer Akhilesh Upadhyay said.
