2020-05-05
Chennai: Against the backdrop of huge spike in cases in the state, Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday told chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his government to continue the ‘aggressive and extensive’ testing strategy adopted by the state. Palaniswami will hold a review meeting at 11am on Tuesday in Ripon Buildings, the headquarters of Greater Chennai Corporation, on the Covid-19 situation.

On an invite, Palaniswami met with Purohit at Raj Bhavan and held discussion for 45 minutes. He was accompanied by health minister C Vijayabaskar, chief secretary K Shanmugam, director general of police J K Tripathy and senior bureaucrats. “The officials explained why the cases are higher, and that it is due to extensive and aggressive testing. The governor told them to continue the strategy. The officials also informed about the relaxations that have come into effect from Monday across the state,” said a source. The governor had a briefing by the CM-led team ahead of his report to the Union home ministry.

The government is of the view that its extensive testing resulted in more positive cases, while other states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, were doing tests for symptomatic cases. “In Chennai, at least 98% of Covid-19 positive cases are asymptomatic,” an official said. Palaniswami will hold a review meeting with over 40 officers in the rank of IAS and IPS officers, district revenue officers, and officials from the local body and health and family welfare department to ensure management of containment zones.
