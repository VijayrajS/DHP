2020-06-11
Madurai: The Madras high court on Wednesday ordered notice to the state government on a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought the state government to provide Covid-19 relief to all registered unorganised sector workers including construction workers irrespective of the renewal of membership.A division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi passed the order while hearing the petition filed by P Ponkumar, president of the Thamizhaga Kattida Thozhilalar Mathiya Sangam based at Madurai. Ponkumar stated that following the announcement of lockdown, the state government had distributed Rs 1,000 relief and essential commodities to all the registered unorganised sector workers in the state. He stated that 32 lakh workers have enrolled in the construction workers welfare board in the state. But, due to various reasons such as migration in search of employment, several workers were unable to renew their membership. Due to this, the Covid-19 relief was provided only to nearly 12 lakh active members.Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench. He stated that since only 50% of the workers are employed in construction works as per government norms, the livelihood of several others is affected. Therefore, he sought the state to provide additional relief of Rs 5,000 to all the registered construction workers from the funds accumulated in the welfare board. The case was adjourned to June 17 for further hearing.
