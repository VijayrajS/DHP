Kejriwal said the issue was discussed by his government, but a decision was taken against reducing their trips. “If the frequency is reduced, there will be crowding,” he added, while urging Delhiites to stay at home as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Delhi government has decided to extend the timings of the free disinfection of public service vehicles, including autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and taxis, to cut down the long queues at the bus depots where the drive is being carried out.

The CM said, “We are disinfecting buses, ISBTs and metro trains daily. We were also disinfecting private public service vehicles, like autorickshaws and taxis, daily in two shifts from 10am to noon and from 4.30pm to 6.30pm at all our DTC and cluster bus depots for free. Owing to the long queues at the bus depots, we have decided to conduct the disinfection drive from 10am to 6pm. We will also double the manpower at bus depots that witness a lot of rush.”

There has been a huge decline in the number of interstate buses coming to Delhi’s ISBTs and bus services from Jammu and Kashmir and Nepal have completely stopped, Kejriwal said. Delhi government is also disinfecting buses coming from other states. The government has made it mandatory for interstate buses to produce certificates of disinfection from their originating depots before being allowed to enter ISBTs in Delhi.

On Wednesday, 11,081 certificates of disinfection were issued to public service vehicles at various bus depots. Though this service is not mandatory, Delhi government has advised the owners and operators to get their vehicles disinfected daily.

“We have received an overwhelming response to our disinfection drive. Because of this, we have decided to extend it to the entire day. Our motive is to disinfect as many vehicles as possible,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. “Would request other public service vehicle owners to avail the free disinfection service being offered by Delhi government,” he later tweeted.

Delhi government had initially started disinfection drive for DTC and cluster buses. The facility was later extended to other public service vehicles, like autorickshaws, Gramin Sewa, Phat-Phat Sewa, Maxi Cab and eco-friendly vehicles, free of cost.
