2020-04-08
VADODARA: Following the death of an elderly Covid positive man in Godhra, the health officials in Godhra are on their toes after a man tested positive in Dungarpur district in Rajasthan. It has come to light that the man returning from a jamaat in Gujarat had also made a stopover in Godhra.


Sources said that the man who had tested positive belongs to Simalwada, located near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. He was part of a group that had attended the jamaat and while returning to Rajasthan visited Godhra. Members of the group were from different places in Rajasthan.

Health officials in Godhra said that they while they have been informed about the man testing positive, they are awaiting further details about his movement from Simalwada and who else were with him. “The police will work on these details after which work can begin,” said an official. He added that they are still not aware of the area where the group or the man who had tested positive had stayed in Gujarat, or in Godhra. Even in the case of the elderly Godhra man who tested Covid-19 positive and died recently, the Godhra administration is yet to ascertain how he got infected though he had no travel history.
