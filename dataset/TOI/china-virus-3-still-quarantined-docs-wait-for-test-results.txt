NEW DELHI: Of the three persons quarantined at RML Hospital following the outbreak of coronavirus in China’s Wuhan, one is a 48-year-old businessman who returned from Beijing on January 17. He has fever, body ache and difficulty in swallowing. The others are a 34-year-old businessman and a 24-year-old student suffering from milder symptoms similar to common flu. 


The doctors say isolation will be maintained till the test results are out as they have a history of travel to China. While two of them are residents of Delhi, the third person comes from Noida, said Dr Meenkashi Bhardwaj, medical superintendent of the hospital.

 
 
“We are completely ready. The isolation ward has eight beds, which can be increased if required. We are following all infection-control practices and using protective equipment while dealing with the suspected cases,” she added.

 
 

Till Monday, 33,552 passengers arriving to India from China in 155 flights have been screened for a possible exposure to the respiratory virus. Till January 14, 17 samples have been received by the ICMR-NIV lab, out of which 14 have been found negative.
