PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has set up special teams to cremate the bodies of deceased Covid-19 patients. 


Six teams, which will have vans, dedicated staff for cremation and PPE kits will be assigned to taking the bodies from the hospitals to crematoriums. They will also take the responsibility of sanitation and disinfection of the cremation facilities. 

Civic officials said the decision was taken after the cremation of two bodies was delayed due to non- availability of PPE kits for the civic staff at the cremation ground. The relatives had to wait for four hours for the last rites. 

“Ward officials were expected to coordinate with the teams,provide manpower and the vehicle for transportation of the body. But a miscommunication between the officials at these decentralised offices and hospitals led to the delay,” a senior civic official said. Senior officials had to intervene to make sure that the kits reach the ambulance. 

“The new system introduced by the PMC will make sure that the cremation takes place without hassles. The members will know the standard operating procedure for the cremation,” Shrinivas Kandul, head of PMC's electrical department, said. 

The civic administration has decided to reserve the crematoriums for such cases. These teams will make sure that the dead bodies are taken to the nearest facility. Gas crematoriums are to be used. The guidelines from the Union and state government for cremating the bodies will be followed. 

Those handling such cases must have minimum contact with the body. The team members must have fully covered protective body gear, face mask, hand gloves, shoes and sanitisers.
