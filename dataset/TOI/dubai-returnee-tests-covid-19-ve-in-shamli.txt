MEERUT: A 33-year-old man from Shamli’s Kairana tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday. He had returned from Dubai on March 15 and started showing symptoms of the infection on Saturday.


Shamli district magistrate Jasjeet Kaur said, “A person has tested positive for Covid-19 in Shamli on Tuesday. As soon as he developed the symptoms, he went into home quarantine and sent his sample for testing. He was later moved into an isolation ward at the community health centre when his results confirmed the infection. His family — wife and two children — too have been admitted to the isolation ward as a precautionary measure. Health officials have sent their samples too for testing.” The district administration immediately ordered a 24-hour lockdown of Shamli and imposed prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC. 

“An immediate lockdown has been ordered in Shamli and not more than five people can gather at a spot under section 144 of CrPc. Only essential items like groceries and medicines will be available for residents. Nobody should leave their homes unnecessarily and all borders of the district have been sealed,” she added.

Saharanpur divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar said, “This is the first case under Saharanpur commissionerate. People are requested to stay indoors and comply with the orders of the district administration. Strict action will be taken against defaulters.”

Later in the day, chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced a three-day lockdown of all 75 districts in the state, adding that curfew may be imposed in some places.
