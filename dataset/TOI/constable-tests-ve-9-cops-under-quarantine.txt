PUNE: A constable from a police station that is outside the containment zones in the city tested positive for Covid-19, prompting authorities to quarantine nine policemen who came in contact with her at the workplace. 

A senior officer from the police station told TOI that the constable stays in the Peth areas. “Recently, her friend tested positive for Covid-19. The constable, who was in contact with her, too had undergone the test and her report came positive for the contagion,” the officer said. 

However, she did not show any symptoms. “She used to work and have lunch with her colleagues in the police station. We have identified nine of them and quarantined them. Their swab samples would be sent for tests,” the officer added. 

The officer said the area, which comes under the police station, is quite large. “We are trying our best to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection with the help of the limited staff available here,” the officer added.
