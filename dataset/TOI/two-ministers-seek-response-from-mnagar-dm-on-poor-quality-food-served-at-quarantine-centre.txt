MUZAFFARNAGAR: After an inspection revealed that a contractor, holding an expired licence, was providing ‘poor quality’ food at a quarantine centre, two UP ministers sought a reply from district magistrate Mahender Prasad on the state of quarantine centres across the district and how money is being spent on it. There are more than 20 quarantine centres in Muzaffarnagar district.

The two ministers who sought details are Muzaffarnagar’s BJP MP and minister of state of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries Sanjeev Balyan, and state minister Kapil Dev Aggarwal.

Notably, tehsildar Pushkar Nath Chaudhry, who was posted at Sadar tehsil, was suspended after the incident came to light.

Speaking to TOI, Balyan, said, “I received a reply from the administration, which revealed that Rs 40 lakh was spent on food across the quarantine centres. After the clarification, it seems that there is no scam while purchasing food for the quarantine centres, but an inquiry is still on the procedure of tender given to the company whose licence had expired in February.”

According to sources, the contractor managed to get the tender to supply food at quarantine centres across Muzaffarnagar, despite having an expired licence.

Balyan said the matter is being probed by the additional district magistrate (finance) and promised action against whoever responsible for the negligence.
