2020-04-09
VIJAYAWADA: A 64-year-old cancer patient from Visakhapatnam was supposed to get his immunotherapy infusion by April 4. But his relatives are still waiting for the arrival of the life-saving medications, which rare stuck in Hyderabad. They are not even sure when the medicines will reach them.


Several others with chronic diseases are struggling to to be treated with the government focusing on dealing with the Covid outbreak and closing outpatients services. 

Speaking to TOI, Monika Kahlon, daughter-in-law of the patient, said they ordered the immunotherapy drugs with a manufacturer in Hyderabad who subsequently arranged a logistics partner for the delivery of the medication. “We had to directly purchase the medication only after the cancer hospital informed us that they could not procure it. We placed the purchase order on April 3 and the logistics partner assured us of the delivery by April 6. But on April 7, they informed us that nobody is willing to travel to Visakhapatnam,” said Kahlon.

Kahlon further added that the logistics company people on Tuesday informed her that a domestic cargo flight would be flying to Visakhapatnam on Wednesday or Thursday. “But when I asked the flight carrier, they denied operating such a flight to Vizag,” she said.

Kahlon said that the government needs to ease restrictions on certain transport modalities on medical grounds to continue the treatments, which otherwise would put the cancer patients in grave danger. 

She further added that she tweeted about her distress to all the leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, but has not received any help.
