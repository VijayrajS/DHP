KOLKATA: As many as 37 Kolkata Police personnel from different units, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, were released from KPC Hospital on Saturday. 

Most of the infected cops had fever and some other symptoms at the time of admission. With their release, the number of Kolkata police personnel who have recovered rose to 165. Twenty other cops admitted to the same hospital are likely to recover soon. After being released from hospital, they were asked to undergo two weeks of home quarantine and some extra rest, if possible.

The good news, though, was short lived as news of 10 new personnel getting infected was reported from the Kolkata Police.
