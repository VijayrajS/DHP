2020-04-29
PATNA: Even though the Covid-19 fatality rate in Bihar is much low, just two so far, all possible measures are being taken to ensure scientific disposal of the bodies of the ones dying due to the infection. 


Patna district epidemiologist Prashant Kumar said several guidelines have been issued by the state health department in this regard, including presence of limited number of people during the last rites. 

“The guidelines also prohibit family members from touching the body in order to avoid the risk of virus transmission. For health workers attending to the body, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as water-resistant apron, goggles, mask and gloves, has been made mandatory,” he said.

Patna DM Kumar Ravi said all necessary guidelines issued by the health department were being followed as far as handling of the bodies of Covid-19 victims is concerned. “Two people – one from Munger and another from Vaishali – have so far died in the state due to Covid-19. While the Munger man was buried according to Islamic rituals, the one from Vaishali was cremated in Patna,” he said.

The DM said the body of the Vaishali man, who died in Patna, was sanitized with antiseptic solution and covered with a leakproof plastic body bag. “PPE kits were given to all those involved in the cremation. The family members were allowed to see the last rites from a distance,” he said.

He added, “Even though there’s a high risk of getting infected by the virus through a body, the power of virus reduces after death as it stops getting the nutrition.”

Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore said several initiatives have been taken to spread awareness among people. “Health workers are trying their best to inform people about the spread of virus,” he said.
