Gandhinagar: The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China has led the Gujarat government convene a meeting of district CDHOs and municipal corporation health officers two days ago. Since Monday, the state commissioner of health instructed that prior to the intimation from central health authorities, infrastructure and the manpower required for screening fevers be readied. 

“The principal focus will be city airports. Since there are no direct flights to or from China in Gujarat, we will be dependent on inputs from metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi,” says a senior state health official. 

The authorities also discussed whether there were previous cases of the viral disease in neighbouring states or in Gujarat. The official also added that the paramedic staff required for patient care in the wake of an epidemic has been earmarked. “The WHO has already instituted a protocol which is widely followed and we plan to rely on it till further intimation from the central health authorities,” adds the official. 

He added that Gujarat authorities are closely studying the handling of Kerala’s Nipah virus outbreak to control spread of the virus. “We have made provisions for isolation wards in major city hospitals across the state,” adds the official.
