Gujarat HC: Don't use court orders to politicise Covid
2020-06-01
AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Sunday said that had it not been for the state government’s actions all would have been dead by now. Hence, court orders, in which it lambasted the government for inadequacies in its response to Covid-19 pandemic, should not be made basis to criticise the government and politicise Covid-19 issue.



In an order released on Sunday, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice J B Pardiwala said, “We request one and all to be very careful from now onward before commenting or entering into any debate with regard to court orders that are being passed from time to time in public interest. Our message is loud and clear. We need not further elaborate on this issue.”

In line with what the solicitor general submitted before the SC earlier this week on the migrants’ crisis, the bench further said, “All those who cannot extend their helping hand in these difficult times and do anything good for the people at large, have no right to criticise the functioning of the state government. If the state government would not have been doing anything, as alleged, then probably, by now, we all would have been dead.”

Ending public agony over government control on Covid-19 testing which is alleged to be causing either delays or denial in diagnosis and treatment, the HC said private hospitals will not need to get approval for Covid testing before surgery. Significantly, it also put a deadline of 24 hours for government to grant approval for Covid test to laboratories.

The HC also warned the principal health secretary of action if any patient is refused admission by Civil Hospital. 

For past one month, the HC has posed various questions and made adverse observations about management of healthcare facilities in Gujarat and state government’s response to the plight of migrant workers and the poor.
