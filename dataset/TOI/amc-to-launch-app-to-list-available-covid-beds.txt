2020-06-13
AHMEDABAD: The Ahmebabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Ahmedabad Medical Association with Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) have joined hands to launch an app to update details of beds available for Covid-19 patients at government and private hospitals.


Chairman of the AMC standing committee, Amul Bhatt, told reporters on Friday after a committee meeting that the demand for the app had been pending for some time. “The AMC has finalized it and is currently waiting for the approval from the AMA and the AHNA,” said Bhatt. 

Meanwhile, the AHNA has begun posting the information on bed availability on its website http://www.ahna.org.in/ from Friday onwards. However, it only provides information on the AMC quota of beds and ventilators available.

AHNA president Dr Bharat Gadhvi said that the website would be updated twice a day – at 10 am and at 6 pm – after collating data with the member hospitals. “The number of hospitals will gradually increase as we are putting a system in place,” he said.

The app is likely to get ready in two days, according to Bhatt.
