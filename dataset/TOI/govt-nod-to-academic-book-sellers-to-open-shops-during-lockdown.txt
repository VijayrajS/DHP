Govt nod to academic book sellers to open shops during lockdown
2020-04-23
Dehradun: After the Union home ministry enlisted educational book stores in the list of essential services, the Uttarakhand education department issued an order on Wednesday stipulating that book shops which deal in academic syllabus books and stationery items, will remain open during the lockdown. This decision has been taken as many school students were finding it difficult to get their academic books, state education minister Arvind Pandey told TOI.

Pandey said that earlier in the week, he had requested Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank to consider allowing academic book stores to open. “It was important that books are made available to the students so that they can continue with their studies. I would like to thank the Union home ministry for enlisting educational book stores in essential services. Now, NCERT books will be easily available to school children since they are mandatory in every school (private or government) of our state,” said the minister.

The order states that the name, contact number, and addresses of book sellers should be circulated so that people in the respective areas are made aware that they are open during the lockdown. Also, home delivery services should be made available.

Meanwhile, the state education department has collaborated with public service broadcaster Doordarshan to organise televised classes for school students. 

“Videos are being prepared by experts and these will be televised on DD Uttarakhand from April 24 onwards. The videos will be broadcast every day from 10 am to 11:30 am during the lockdown period,” said Pandey.

The televised sessions are being prepared for students of Class IX, X, and XII and will focus on subjects like English, Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Three classes of different subjects will be broadcast daily, as per education department officials.
