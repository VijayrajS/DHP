Dharwad: A man from Dharwad who returned from a tour of foreign countries and was in 14-day home isolation has tested negative for Covid-19.

Deputy commissioner Deepa Cholan told reporters here on Sunday that the patient with travel history of Mecca and Medina returned to Dharwad on February 27. He was under home quarantine, but developed cough and fever on Saturday. The patient was admitted to the District Civil Hospital and his blood samples and throat swab were sent for test to a laboratory in Shivamogga the same day. The district administration has received medical report on Sunday evening.

This is the second suspected Covid-19 case that has tested negative in the district. Deeepa said there are no other suspected case in the district and urged the public not to panic. She also told people not to believe in fake news which are aimed at creating fear.

The district administration and health department are continuing precautionary measures to check the spread of coronavirus. “Cleanliness should be the top priority,” she said.

Meanwhile, health department officials cautioned street food vendors in the twin cities to adopt safety measures and maintain hygiene. They inspected the kitchen, drinking water facilities and utensils at several food stalls in Dharwad.

Vendors have been asked to use hot water to wash utensils and warned against dumping waste food at public places.

Officials said vendors not adhering to safety regulations will lose their licence and their shops will be seized. They will also face hefty penalty and legal action.
