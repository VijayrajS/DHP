Allow all private hospitals with capability to do Covid-19 tests: Delhi high court
2020-06-12
NEW DELHI: In a timely intervention, Delhi high court on Thursday directed all private hospitals in the city to start conducting Covid-19 tests if they had the facility. The order would help patients being forced to wait to get tested.


A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad noted, “It appears that Delhi is fast heading towards becoming the corona capital of the country, an epithet the city can well do without. We are of the opinion that it is the need of the hour that all private hospitals equipped with a lab to undertake Covid-19 test be permitted to do so without any further loss of time.”

At present, 40 labs — 17 government-run and 23 private — are approved in Delhi for Covid-19 testing. The court’s order, which came after taking note of the phenomenal spike in cases and the need to ramp up tests, will increase the number of testing centres.

The judges also expressed concern over the plight of non-Covid patients who go to private hospitals for emergency surgeries and other such procedures. They are not attended to till they undergo a Covid-19 test, for which they have to go elsewhere.

Terming it “most unfortunate”, the court ordered all private hospitals asked by the AAP government to reserve 20% beds for admitting Covid-19 patients and which have labs sanctioned by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to “conduct tests on symptomatic and asymptomatic persons who seek admission to the hospital for undergoing surgeries and procedures of other nature.”

To verify if all the 23 private labs are carrying out testing at present, given conflicting orders by Delhi government, the court asked these labs to file affidavits clarifying if they had been permitted to test suspected Covid-19 patients by adopting the RT-PCR or CB-NAAT test. “They shall also point out the difficulties, if any, faced by them on account of any bureaucratic red-tapism,” it directed.

In another key direction, the court made ICMR a party to the matter and asked it to furnish details of private hospitals authorised by it to undertake Covid-19 tests. ICMR, while filing its status report, shall also indicate the number of applications submitted by accredited labs in Delhi seeking permission to conduct Covid-19 test and the status of the same.

The order came on the application by advocate Sanjeev Sharma, who had contended that there had been several instances where non-Covid patients needing surgery or emergency procedures were required to undergo testing before that. However, the hospitals said they were not permitted by Delhi government to conduct the test.

So far, 2.71 lakh Covid tests have been conducted in Delhi. The positivity rate of tests conducted has gone up from about 4% in the initial period to 35%, data shows, reflecting the spread of the disease. On Thursday, officials said 5,360 people were tested for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours of which 1,877 (35%) tested positive.

Recently, Delhi government had barred seven private labs from conducting Covid-19 tests citing irregularities. While six of them have resumed testing, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a Covid-designated facility, is yet to get government approval.
