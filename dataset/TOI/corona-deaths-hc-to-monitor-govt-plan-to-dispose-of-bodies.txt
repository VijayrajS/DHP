Coronavirus deaths: Delhi HC to monitor government plan to dispose of bodies
2020-06-03
NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday indicated it would monitor implementation of the AAP government’s new norms devised for faster disposal of bodies of those who died of Covid-19.


A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said it wanted to see how the May 30 direction of the health department was implemented and asked Delhi government to file an updated status report two days before the next hearing on June 15.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation initiated suo motu after coming across news reports on lack of cremation facilities and piling up of bodies in mortuaries.

The department’s order has fixed the responsibility for timely disposal of the Covid-19-positive/suspect bodies on the medical director/director of the hospital where a patient dies or is brought dead. “Respective municipal corporations shall make all arrangements to cremate/bury such bodies,” the order stated. 

Such a body will be sent to a mortuary within two hours of death in a hospital or being brought dead there, and if the family or relatives of the deceased contact the mortuary within 12 hours, the hospital will schedule the cremation/burial within next 24 hours, the order specified. If no family member or relative gets in touch in 12 hours, an intimation will be sent to them through the area SHO regarding the date, time and place of cremation/burial.

On Monday, Delhi government filed an affidavit stating that it had stopped testing the dead for Covid-19 and due to this the relatives were not claiming the bodies, leading to the delays. Another reason cited was social stigma attached to the disease and the fear of quarantine. Often relatives are also misinformed that the hospital will dispose of the body while it is only a facilitator and the kin of a deceased will have to claim the body, the affidavit added.
