Contacts would be screened intensely within the zone. People in the containment zone would have to get their essential commodities delivered at the doorsteps. Those who are sick in the zone and buffer zone adjoining it would be monitored regularly. With the three cases on Thursday, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Madurai went up to 44.

Ramanathapuram reported three cases, one a 30-year- old man from a place where four cases have already been reported. Two cases are from Anandur near R S Mangalam and Mandapam from where cases have not been reported earlier. All three men had attended the religious congregation. These areas were contained fully and screening of contacts of the two new cases was initiated. With these new cases, the total cases in Ramanathapuram went up to 10. With one new case, the number of cases in Tirunelveli went up to 58 on Thursday.
