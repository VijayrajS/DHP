Covid-19 doctors seek lodging, don't want to put family at risk

BENGALURU: Some doctors on Covid-19 duty in government hospitals have sought separate accommodation as they don’t want to return home and put family members at risk. They suggested the government’s Kumara Krupa guest house be earmarked for them.


“We could be carriers of the virus. To avoid going home every day, we should be given accommodation close to the hospital,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity.

The doctors, including several women, said they had enquired at paying guest facilities near hospitals. “No one agreed to keep us. There is fear among the public. We end up commuting every day and most of us live on the outskirts,” said a woman doctor working in the Covid-19 ward at a hospital near Malleswaram.

At another government facility, nurses staying in quarters go home once a week. “We get tested once in 14 days. We are tense till the results come negative,” said a nurse.

Dr Srinivas GA, president of Karnataka Government Medical Officers’ Association, said: “Doctors are frontline workers who must be protected. They should be given accommodation near the hospital. They may not have an isolated room at home.”
