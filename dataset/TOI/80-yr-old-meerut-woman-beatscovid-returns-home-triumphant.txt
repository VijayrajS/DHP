The video showed the woman sitting on a chair and her family lifting her to take her home.Notably, the woman’s sample was collected after she fractured her hip. And she then tested positive for Covid-19. Unable to move, and requiring constant assistance, she was admitted to Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College for treatment on April 29. To much jubilation of healthcare workers, family and residents, she returned home in 14 days.An elated Dr TVS Arya, nodal officer of Covid-19 ward at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, said, “The 80-year-old woman from Rajban was diagnosed with the deadly disease after she broke her hip bone a few days ago. She is still unable to walk much and is dependent on others for her movement.
