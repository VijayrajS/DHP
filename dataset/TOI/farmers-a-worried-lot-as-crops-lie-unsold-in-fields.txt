Rajasthan lockdown: Farmers a worried lot as crops lie unsold in fields
2020-04-18
JAISALMER: The condition of farmers is getting worse due to the ongoing lockdown in the country. The crops have been harvested, but farmers are unable to sell their produce and are not getting proper price for their crops.


Moreover, the farmers are concerned as western disturbance is active which could cause rain and storms. In Barmer, jeera crop worth Rs 1,500 crore has been harvested and is lying in the fields. Usually, the produce is sold in Unjha market of Gujarat which is closed. Transportation has been stopped due to the lockdown, thus, the crops are lying in fields. The Centre has directed that Rabi crop of wheat and rice be purchased on minimum support price, but jeera and isabgol have been excluded.

Farmers are unable to sell their crops while they have taken loan from moneylenders and had to repay in March-April. In such a situation, the farmers have asked the Centre and state to purchase jeera and isabgol on MSP.

There was a time when farmers of Barmer were facing continuous drought but now Barmer has forayed into oil, lignite, energy and other sectors. Similarly, in many areas there are reserves of potable water and nothing is impossible for the farmers now. Apart from horticulture, there has been bumper yield of jeera and isabgol. In Baytu, Sheo, Gardra road and Girab areas of Barmer, the farmers have produced jeera worth Rs 20 lakh.
