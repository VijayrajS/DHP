2020-03-30
NEW DELHI: As many as 59% of people were unable to get essential goods such as milk, pulses, wheat, rice, sugar etc through e-commerce platforms on March 27-28, while 40% were unable to get these items when they visited local retail stores on those days. These are the findings of a survey conducted by social media firm LocalCircles. 

This was the fourth such consumer survey carried out in the last week to ascertain if the demand was being met by the existing supply.

 
 

Conducted on March 27-28, the survey received 17,000+ responses. The numbers showed a marginal improvement from March 25-26 when 61% of those who ordered essential goods online did not get them and 43% of those who went to local retail stores failed.

 The survey stated, “The key challenge reported by consumers is that many local retail stores are still closed and not delivering because their owners and managers have still not received curfew passes. In addition, it has been reported that the stores are missing a good percentage of their workforce as many have gone back to their hometowns/villages”.

It added that lack of clear instructions to police and officials had also led to restrictions on movement of vehicles and people engaged in carrying essential goods.
