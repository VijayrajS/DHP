Lucknow: An outbreak of Covid-19 is now threatening the Government Railway Police (GRP) ranks at Charbagh railway station with six more constables including one of Railway Protection Force (RPF) testing positive.

This takes the novel coronavirus infection tally for the forces to 10 in three days. 

In all, 14 persons were diagnosed with the disease, taking the city’s tally to 355. Of these, 292 have recovered, while two died during treatment. 

According to health officers, all constables detected with the infection so far had been deployed to manage thousands of migrant workers coming from different states via Shramik trains. They are all undergoing treatment at KGMU. 

Of the five GRP constables diagnosed on Thursday, four were among 27 who had been quarantined at Sardar Patel Institute of Medical Sciences on Wednesday and their samples sent for testing after four of their colleagues tested positive. 

The fifth constable lives in GRP lines and had come in contact with those infected earlier. “The RPF constable, a resident of RDSO, Para, got himself tested voluntarily after influenza-like symptoms surfaced. Ten of his close contacts including family members have been quarantined and are being tested,” said chief medical officer Dr Narendra Agarwal.

“Contacts of all the constables tested positive are being traced,” he added.

Meanwhile, four more migrants, including two women and the son of an SGPGI employee tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. While two had come from Ahmedabad, one each was from Mumbai and Jhajjar. As many as 43 migrant workers and their family members have tested positive in the city till date. 

A mother-son duo from Sadar were the other two infected. They were tested at SGPGI where the woman had gone for treatment. So far, 112 positive cases have been reported from various localities of Sadar.
