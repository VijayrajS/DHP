Andhra Pradesh govt insurance for 2.5 lakh Covid-19 workers
2020-04-23
VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government has decided to include around 2.5 lakh sachivalayam volunteers, working for the purpose of Covid-19 management, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP). The special chief secretary to the department of health, medical and family welfare department had issued the circular on Tuesday.


The circular stated that 2.6 lakh village/ward volunteers are carrying out door-to-door surveys and have already completed three rounds of fever surveillance. It is likely that they may come in the contact with Covid-19 positive patients. Hence, it is deemed fit that all such village/ward volunteers are included under the PMGKP. 

“Under this scheme, affected volunteers won’t get any amount for treatment or quarantined period. Only in case of death where the volunteer has been tested positive his/her family members will get Rs 50 lakh. This is at least better than getting nothing,” Samyam Hemanth Kumar, state president of AP Nirudyoga (Unemployed) Joint Action Committee told TOI. 

On April 5, TOI had reported how one lakh secretaries of sachivalayams and around 2.5 lakh volunteers working under them are risking their lives by carrying out field work without any PPE or health insurances. While a secretary gets Rs 15,000 as salary per month, a volunteer just gets an ad hoc payment of Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000.
