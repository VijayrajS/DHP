2020-04-18
Surat: She has been dealing with Covid up and close, literally. After handling nearly 60 cases till now, 23-year-old emergency medical technician (EMT) of an EMRI 108 ambulance, Hetal Patel, started showing symptoms of the virus. 

Patel developed weakness and body ache and started to vomit on April 14. Since she was handling suspected Covid-19 patients, she immediately approached doctors in the New Civil Hospital. Patel was put in isolation and her samples were sent of testing. However, thankfully they came out to be negative. But even when the authorities asked her to go on leave and rest, the resolute young woman refused to leave her work and soon resumed duties.

Faiyaz Pathan, program manager, EMRI 108 ambulance, Surat was all praise for Patel. “She had handled nearly 60 Covid19 patients till now and when she developed similar symptoms, we were worried. But she tested negative on Wednesday, and we wanted her to take some rest. However, she refused the offer flatly and is proving to be a glorious example of dedication to work despite working in risky conditions,” Pathan added.

Patel, a tribal from Gholar village in Chikhli of Navsari, said, “I was feeling normal after a day’s rest and hence I joined work. I was not afraid and fortunately I am not infected too. It is my duty to help people in this critical time. My work is more important than my taking a rest at this moment. I therefore decided to renew my fight against the spread of the virus.”

Daughter of farm labourers, Natubhai and Rekhaben, Patel has been working as an EMT for the past two years after completing her nursing course.
