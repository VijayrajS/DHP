Fight coronavirus with patience: Nitish Kumar
2020-04-27
PATNA: As 11 more Covid-19 patients were discharged from Nalanda Medical College and Hospital on Sunday after they won the battle against the deadly virus, CM Nitish Kumar called upon people to have patience, be alert and continue to maintain social distancing norms.


“Covid-19 patients are being cured. They are returning home from hospitals on a regular basis. There is no need to get panicky. One should show patience and remain alert,” Nitish said while holding a meeting with senior officials to review Covid-19 situation in the state. He asked people to maintain social distancing if they want to stay healthy.

“In initial days, we observed a trend that people returning from abroad were getting infected. Later, many of their contacts also got infected. Chain of such patients has almost been broken in the state. Now, we are finding a new trend. Infection is now found in migrant workers and others who have returned from different parts of the country. The infection is spreading at a faster pace through their contacts,” Nitish said. He stressed the need for intensive door-to-door screening of people to check the new trend.

The CM asked the health department officials to ensure intensive health check-up of all those people who have returned from the other states to break the new chain of Covid-19 in the state.

Nitish called upon the people who have returned from other states not to conceal their travel history and turn up at the nearest hospital if they develop coronavirus symptoms like fever, cough and cold.

He asked the health officials to expedite contact tracing, sample collection and testing so that the chain of Covid-19 could be broken.

Nitish further asked the health and animal and fisheries resources department officials to keep strict vigil on other diseases like AES, Japanese encephalitis, bird flu and swine fever.
