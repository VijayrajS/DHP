Madurai: The famous Chithirai festival of the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple which witnesses lakhs of devotees would be cancelled this year if the lockdown is extended. This year, the flag hoisting ceremony for the Chithirai festival was slated to be held on April 25. The celestial wedding, the culminating event of the festival was scheduled on May 4. “It is really disheartening to even think that this festival would be cancelled. I have been witnessing it every year religiously since 1980. It is something that I look forward to as soon as the new year begins,” said K Deivanai, 80, a resident of Simmakkal.“It was conducted regularly ever since the rule of King Thirumalai Naicker, as he organized it as a big event by linking the Meenakshi temple and Alagarkoil temple,” temple sources said. Joint commissioner of the Meenakshi temple said they are awaiting the government’s order on the conduct of the festival. If the lockdown is extended the festival cannot be held, he said. As of now, priests are conducting the pujas six times a day.
