MUMBAI: With the addition of 44 deaths on Thursday, the Covid-19 toll in Maharashtra breached the 1,000 mark to reach 1,019. The state has crossed 1,000 deaths in just over two months since the first case was reported here. About 55% of the total deaths have come in the past 14 days of May alone.

Gujarat, which has reported 566 deaths so far, is a distant second among the states in terms of fatalities. 

Maharashtra also added over 1,000 cases for the ninth day in a row. Thursday saw 1,602 new cases, the second highest single-day jump, taking the total tally to 27,524 cases.

Experts have said that the state should come up with newer measures, given that the existing ones seem to have been ineffective in arresting the spread of the virus. Heath minister Rajesh Tope, however, told TOI that the increase in cases was due to rigorous contact tracing and focused testing. The state has so far tested over 2.40 lakh people, he said. 

He also added that none of the mathematical projections predicting an explosion of cases have come true. “We are not adding cases at that rate. In my opinion, not one of those projections will come true,” Tope said.
Tope said that the lockdown in MMR and other hotspots like Pune region and Malegaon will continue till the end of the month but noted that some relaxations could be given with the view to restarting economic activities in these areas.

Of the 44 deaths in the state, Mumbai reported 25, while 10 deaths were recorded from Navi Mumbai. Five deaths were from Pune, two in Aurangabad city, and one each in Panvel and Kalyan-Dombivli. The 10 deaths recorded in Navi Mumbai were reported between April 14 and May 14.

State officials said that of the 44 persons who died, 34 (77%) had co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc. Dr TP Lahane of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said death audits across the state have shown uncontrolled sugar and BP levels. “Sometimes, blood sugar is in the range of 400-500,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the health department at the Thane Municipal Corporation was sealed for sanitation after a woman clerk tested positive. Thane’s cases also crossed the 900 mark as 70 patients were detected positive, the highest so far in 24 hours; plus, five deaths were recorded. The clerk is a resident of Kalyan and it is learnt that she used to travel to the TMC headquarters in a bus. Also, the BEST Workers’ Union, the biggest union in the transport undertaking, on Thursday gave a call to 40,000 staffers to “stay home” from Monday and not report for duties if the list of demands by the union are not accepted by the administration. This came close on the heels of 3 more staffers testing positive and the total rising to 98.

Tope said the discharge policy laid down by the Central government will help take the load off the testing infrastructure and also free up beds. On Thursday, 512 people were discharged across the state, taking the total number of discharged patients to 6,059.
