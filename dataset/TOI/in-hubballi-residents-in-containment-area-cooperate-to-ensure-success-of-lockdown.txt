2020-04-12
Hubballi: The district administration and law enforcement authorities were at their wits’ end trying to persuade the residents of Hubballi to respect the lockdown, and stay indoors. Although successful to an extent, many residents kept straying on to the roads, much to the chagrin of the authorities. However, the confirmation of the first Covid-19 case in Hubballi has successfully ensured that a majority of the residents are adhering to the lockdown. 

Police have stepped up patrolling and several roads are being barricaded. This, coupled with a rise in awareness among the public, has helped the Dharwad district administration impose the lockdown more systematically. 

Curbing vehicular movement 

Police are using bamboo sticks in order to erect barricades in order to check vehicular movement on the streets of Hubballi. All roads within the containment area have been effectively barricaded and those loitering on the streets needlessly are being dealt with strictly. 

ASHA, anganwadi workers roped in for survey 

Owing to the sheer magnitude of the area currently under containment, the district administration has reached out to ASHA and anganwadi workers to assist the authorities in carrying out the survey of all the residents. Meanwhile, pourakarmikas are sprinkling the entire containment area with sodium hypochlorite. 

The containment area in question, circumscribed by a three-kilometre radius with Mulla Oni as the epicentre, comprises seven zones and 35 wards with a population of more than 5.7 lakh. For the past two days, nearly everyone within in this restricted area has stayed indoors. The district administration is ensuring that all the essential commodities are being delivered at the residents’ doorstep.
