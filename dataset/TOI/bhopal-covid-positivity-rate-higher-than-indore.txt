2020-06-13
BHOPAL: In a warning sign for the administration, Bhopal has surpassed Indore — MP’s worst-hit district — in number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the first 11 days of Unlock 1.0.

The rate of positive reports per 100 tests in Bhopal is nearly 1.5 times that of Indore in June. While more people were tested for Covid-19 in Indore and fewer tested positive, Bhopal tested far fewer samples yet more people tested positive.

 

Between June 1 and June 11, 15,186 samples were tested in Bhopal and 17,949 in Indore. While 571 people tested positive in Bhopal, Indore had only 433 fresh patients in the same period. Things seemed to be normal during the first two days of Unlock 1.0. On June 1, fewer people per 100 tested positive in Bhopal than Indore. The same on June 2. But on June 3, the tide started turning with Bhopal and Indore level at 3.2%. The two districts drew nearly level again on June 8 (4.2%).

But between June 4 and June 11 (barring June 8) Bhopal shot past Indore in number of people testing positive. Also, Bhopal has pushed Indore to second place in corona daily count for seven days this month – June 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12. On June 11, Bhopal in fact had over twice as many fresh cases as Indore. While Indore has added 433 new cases this month, Bhopal is alarmingly ahead with 571.


Indore, Bhopal account for 60% MP cases
Indore (3,972 cases) and Bhopal (2,082) together account for nearly 60% of MP’s corona tally. They also account for 53% of the toll. The administrations in these two districts have been battling the pandemic on a war footing, but there are worrying signs in Bhopal this month.

Since June 1, Bhopal has enjoyed more relaxations than Indore. Malls have opened and public transport has been allowed in Bhopal while Indore continues to have stricter restrictions. Bhopal district officials refused to comment on the reason for the higher positivity rate in Bhopal.
