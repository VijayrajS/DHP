Telangana: Overflowing drain makes policemen’s Covid-19 duty tougher
2020-04-24
CHARMINAR: Police personnel on duty at Noble Chowrasta, which falls under Habeebnagar police station limits, are having to endure insanitary work conditions. Overflowing drains and foul smells pose a serious health hazard to the personnel deployed near the checkpost. Despite multiple complaints by the cops to the officials concerned, no action has been taken besides a few inspections. 


“The problem has persisted for past several days now but no initiative has been taken. This is a matter concern for us. The stench has become unbearable at this passage. The conditions pose a serious health risk if it is not addressed immediately,” said sub-inspector K Yadagiri who has been deployed at the junction. 

“We have realised that there are some issues related to water seeping on to the roads. We will consult with different agencies to identify how it happened and rectify the problem as soon as possible,” said a GHMC official. Even in other localities across Old City, locals have grown frustrated with the prevailing unsanitary conditions and the resultant mosquito menace.
