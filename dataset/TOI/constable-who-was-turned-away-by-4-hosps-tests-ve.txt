HYDERABAD: A constable of Chaderghat police station, who tested positive for Covid-19, was sent back from King Koti hospital without collecting samples for testing when he went for a checkup on Monday. Also, another hospital turned him away, saying he did not exhibit symptoms of the infection. After visiting four hospitals on Monday with a request to test him for Covid-19, the constable was finally admitted to a hospital at Nampally after the intervention of senior officials and his samples were sent for testing on Tuesday. 

At 10.30am on Monday, the 40-year-old constable of Chaderghat police station went to a hospital in Malakpet complaining of breathing trouble and profuse sweating. The constable requested doctors to admit him, but due to non-availability of beds, he was instructed to visit police hospital at Amberpet Police Lines. The doctor there referred the constable to King Koti Government Hospital for Covid-19 test.

“Doctors at King Koti Government Hospital examined the constable. Saying that he did not have any Covid-19 symptoms, including fever, cough, they did not recommend him for Covid-19 testing,” Chaderghat inspector P Sateesh said. Not satisfied with the advice of the doctors, the constable went to NIMS. After examining him, the NIMS doctors said that he did not have any Covid-19 symptoms, the inspector said. 

“Despite doctors saying that he did not have the infection symptoms, as he was feeling unwell, the constable went to another hospital at Nampally. Our additional inspector Nagaraju sent an SI with the constable, they spoke to the doctors at that hospital and got him admitted. On Tuesday, his samples were collected and sent for testing. The result came positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday and he was shifted to Gandhi Hospital,” the Chaderghat inspector said.

The constable’s wife and their two children have been placed under quarantine and their samples would also be sent for testing. Five cops, including two SIs and three constables who were secondary contacts of the constable, have also been placed under home quarantine. The constable, a resident of Dabeerpura, worked at the picket near a place of worship in Chaderghat.
