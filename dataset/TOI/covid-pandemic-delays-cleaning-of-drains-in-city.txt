Covid-19 pandemic delays cleaning of drains in Jaipur
2020-05-22
JAIPUR: The ongoing Covid-19 crisis has delayed the process of awarding contracts for cleaning the drains in the city. 

With monsoon just one-and-a-half-month away, the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has finally given contracts for cleaning the drains, but officials fear that the work would not be completed before the arrival of the monsoon. Last year, the contract was given in February.

There are more than 850 small drains in the city and 20 big nullahs that will have to be cleaned by the contractors before monsoon. During monsoon, water clogging is a major problem in the city because of which drains are cleaned at least five months in advance and there had been complaints last year that JMC was not able to clean all the drains before monsoon.

Chief engineer of JMC Anil Singhal said, “The Rs 2.5 crore-contract has been signed in which all the drains will be cleaned before the arrival of monsoon. The time is less because we were busy in the pandemic, but we are positive that we will complete the work before monsoon arrives.”

However, some officials in JMC said special orders have been given to clean drains in lanes where water clogging is a bigger issue during monsoon. There are many areas where water clogging had been a reason for road accidents, so JMC is focusing on such drains.

In case of big nullahs, there were complaints last year that they were not cleaned properly, but this year JMC officials said special instructions have been given to clean them.
