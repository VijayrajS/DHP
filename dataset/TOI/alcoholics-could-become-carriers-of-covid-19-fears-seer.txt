HUBBALLI: The Centreâ€™s decision to allow the sale of liquor with certain restrictions has come in for criticism by Tontada Siddharam Swami of Jagadguru Tontadarya Math. 

He claimed that if alcoholics get liquor now, they will become faster carriers of Covid-19 as they sleep in unhygienic places. 

He said the government should understand the sensitivity of the issue as alcoholics would assault their family members, including children. The seer urged chief minister B S Yediyurappa not to allow the sale of liquor in the state.
