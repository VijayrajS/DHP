Testing centres too few and far between

Vijayawada: The lack of a major virology laboratory in the state has become a concern with the rise in the number of suspected cases of Covid-19. 

As an alternative, state officials have been sending samples for testing to special laboratories set up at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) in Tirupati, Siddhartha Medical College, Vijayawada and Government General Hospital in Kakinada. Each laboratory has about six trained personnel for sample collection, specimen processing and RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction tests) testing.

Each laboratory sends the first 10 samples it collects to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for cross-verification of test results. The results of the other samples are declared by the laboratories in about seven hours. However, logistics involved in the transportation of samples has been consuming a lot of time. 

For example, for a suspected case in Ichchapuram, the sample has to be sent to the special laboratory in Kakinada, which is around 400 km away and is handling samples from five districts.

A state health official said they have a sufficient number of RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction tests) kits at these centres that can help determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “Two more special labs are likely to come up in Anantapur and Visakhapatnam to improve the pace of delivery of results,” said the official.

Dr R Ramana Rao, a general physician, said, “As of now, the state government should consider setting up a special lab in every district as the pandemic is fast spreading in the country. This will come as a great relief for the suspected patients who wait for the results.” 

“Moreover, a high-end virology laboratory in the state is the need of the hour with the evolution of new strains and mutations of microbes. It could help arrive at a clear-cut diagnosis and start treatment in the golden period without necessarily waiting for the test results for days from the laboratories of other places,” Dr Ramana Rao added.
