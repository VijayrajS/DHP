KOLHAPUR: Lush green valleys, cloud kissing mountains and cascading waterfalls draws hordes of tourists to Kolhapur district during the monsoon season, but the lodges and stays in these destinations are anticipating second consecutive slack year in coming months. Moreover, many resorts in these areas have been taken over by the administration to be turned into quarantine facilities.


Last year, heavy floods in Kolhapur had affected monsoon tourism. This year, the fear of novel coronavirus and travel restrictions may hit tourism at the popular destinations such as Radhanagari, Amba ghat, Gaganbawda, Amboli, and Panhala.

The hill station of Amba offers scenic views of Kerle, Paleshwar and Manoli waterfalls along with the historic Vishalgad fort and Pawankhind in its vicinity. Its proximity to Mumbai-Goa highway makes it easily accessible to tourist from Mumbai, Pune and Goa.

Pradeep Jadhav, who owns Vanvisava resort at Amba ghat, said the administration has taken over 33 resorts in the area to be quarantine centres till October. “Currently, there are around 61 people quarantined at my resort. The administration has asked us not to charge these people but expects us to provide them all facilities. We are yet to recover from the losses incurred last year.”

Vanita Desai, who runs a breakfast and lunch-dinner facility from her home in Patgaon village, said trekkers heading to Rangana fort halt at her residence for food. The travel restrictions mean they would not be coming this year, she said.

Abhijeet Lokhande, a tour operator, said Kolhapur and its surroundings attract many tourists.“I am hoping the district administration can work out some solution and allow local tourists to travel,” he said.
