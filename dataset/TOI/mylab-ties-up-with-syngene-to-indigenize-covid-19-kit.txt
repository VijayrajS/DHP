Pune: City-based Mylab Discovery Solutions, which is making Covid-19 test kits and has already supplied over 35,000 of these to more than 20 states, said that it has tied up with Biocon subsidiary Syngene for “self-reliance”.The move is expected to cut-down Mylabs’ reliance on 8-9% of the raw materials that goes into making the kit with the help of Bengaluru-based Syngene. “In a major step to make India self-reliant in Covid-19 testing, Mylab has collaborated with Kiran Mazumdar Shaw’s Syngene,” Mylabs said in a statement.The announcement was first tweeted by Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla and retweeted by Shaw.Poonawalla recently made an undisclosed “multimillion dollar” investment in Mylabs, which, according to the molecular diagnostics company, gave it the scale to go big.“Happy to have a partnership with Syngene, to make Mylab’s COVID-19 test kit more indigenous; reducing its dependency on international raw materials and to further strengthen India’s self-reliance in response to Covid 19,” Poonawalla’s tweet read.Shaw said that Syngene was pleased to make it a truly indigenous kit. “We have a large-scale oligonucleotide facility at its Bengaluru campus which it has repurposed for manufacturing these reagents to support this partnership,” Syngene said in a statement.MyLabs MD Hasmukh Rawal told TOI that the “forward-looking partnership” would cut reliance on imported raw material. “With the Covid-19 situation, every country is likely to look inward and so this partnership with an Indian entity is an important step in the long term,” he said. Two lakh tests per dayCome May, Rawal said the company is geared to make two lakh tests per day to meet the increased demand from states. “For now, we have given each of the ordering states what we could,” he said.Each Mylab kit is capable of handling 100 tests, according to the company.A test kit, Rawal said, takes about 28 days — from planning to delivery — and that the company has already planned for the next phase to make more kits available. The company also said that it will be able to deliver a total of 7 lakh tests before May 3.
