West Bengal lockdown: Sweet sellers stare at 95% loss
2020-04-13
KOLKATA: Poila Baishakh is one of the brightest spots in a mishti-seller’s calendar, but this year the festival is set to leave a bitter aftertaste.


With business establishments and residents deciding to cancel their Poila Baishakh celebrations, mishti-sellers and ancillary industries like milk, chhana and kheer are staring at a loss of over “95%” during the festival next week.

The run up to the festival is one of the busiest periods. The production teams work round the clock to meet the demand but this year, the sweet-shop owners have not even procured the ingredients.

“We are not anticipating any major sales as big business houses have cancelled their Poila Baishakh celebrations. Jewellers, those in paper and garments business and other commercial establishments, place orders worth crores every Poila Baisakh but this year none of them have even enquired. There will hardly be a sale worth 5%,” said Jagannath Ghosh, secretary of the Paschimbanga Mistanna Byabasayee Samity.

There are close to 7,000 sweet shops in the city and its vicinity. Most sweetmeat shops, however, remained shut since the lockdown on March 22. Later, chief minister Mamata Banerjee allowed some to operate from noon to 4pm despite the lockdown. Sweetshop owners, however, said they be allowed to operate from 8am to 12pm. “Due to the lockdown and the heat, very few people have been stepping out in the afternoon to buy sweets,” said Ghosh.

The sweetshop owners do not intend to apply for review of timings on Poila Baishakh.
