Virus forgotten in Visakhapatnam as lockdown eased
2020-05-05
Visakhapatnam: Relaxations after a 43-day-long lockdown led to people thronging city streets in thousands on Monday. With bikes and cars filling up roads, the city resembled its own self before the novel coronavirus stopped life as usual. Cops posted at various check-posts seemed helpless.

Large gatherings were noticed not only outside liquor stores but in many parts of the city. Streets were buzzing with activity as shops opened and roadside vendors returned to business. But not everyone was excited at this public display of frolic which threw caution to the wind.

“People converged on roads in large numbers and put their and other people’s lives at risk of contracting coronavirus,” said N Seetarama Sarma, a senior citizen.

City police commissioner RK Meena said that relaxations to open shops and other establishments do not mean that people can move around on roads in large numbers.

“We urge the people outside containment zones to act wisely, come out only for valid reasons and push back home as soon as possible. You should care about your own and your family’s health,” Meena appealed. 

But such appeals fell on deaf ears as people travelled from one corner of the city to another on Monday. “We were confined to our homes for the last 43 days. Finally, we got the opportunity to see our parents. Which is why we’ve come out,” said M Srinivas on his way to meet his parents.

Vehicles in large numbers were seen from Anandapuram Junction to Anakapalli. Small commercial establishments opened and social distancing norms were given a miss.

District collector Vinay Chand said that wearing masks and maintaining social distance is a must to guard against the virus. But on Monday, after 43 long days of being cooped up at home, people saw the lockdown relaxations as relief and a possible end to the crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.
