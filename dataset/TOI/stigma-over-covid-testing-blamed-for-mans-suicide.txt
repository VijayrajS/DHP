Madurai: Stigma over coronavirus testing blamed for man's suicide
2020-04-02
MADURAI: A man who was taken for Covid-19 testing a few days ago committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in Kappalur two days ago allegedly after a video started making the rounds asking people in his area to be cautious. The test result was said to have come out negative. 


The district administration says they are still investigating the matter as there is no prima facie evidence about this charge.

Mustaffa, 35, of Mullai Nagar in Bibikulam, had been working in Kerala as a coolie when Covid-19 broke out. He came to his motherâ€™s house at Bibikulam with his wife and two children as soon as the curfew was announced. However, some people informed the authorities that he had symptoms of the disease following which he was taken for testing.

It was in these circumstances that the video of a man being taken in a small van for testing from Bibikulam was circulated among the residents and asking them to be cautious. Two days later, railway police found the body of Mustaffa who had apparently jumped in front of a goods train at Kappalur. 

When contacted, Madurai district collector T G Vinay said they were yet to confirm if the man had been taken for Covid-19 testing. They did not have the name of a person by the name Mustaffa in their records which they maintained for all those who were tested for the disease.

The video also shows the man being taken in a load vehicle, which was not done for any person. Hence they were investigating the matter, he said.
