2020-05-22
HYDERABAD: With wildlife wandering into the city becoming a regular feature during the lockdown, many citizens have reported spotting snakes in the city over the last few weeks. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials walking into gated communities, to check if home quarantine guidelines are being adhered to, received numerous complaints from residents over the presence of serpents in their residential complexes.

A few days back, a snake was rescued from Meenakshi Sky Lounge on Hitex Road. In April, society members of the same building had complained about snakes in their residential complex when civic officials visited their place to review the status of foreign returnees under home quarantine. “The snake was rescued by pest control services staff. I request the government to clean the lake adjacent to our society and treat the water too,” said G Prashant, a resident of the housing society.

Meanwhile, Friends of Snakes Society (FSS), an NGO, received around 60 calls from residential localities in the city on an average each day, since Monday. Members of the society said that before the lockdown was imposed, most of the calls they received would be from factories. However post lockdown, calls are coming in from residential localities too.

“I have seen a snake at least six times inside my apartment complex since the lockdown began. It has not been rescued yet, ” said Ridhima V, a resident of Trendset Sumanjali on Road No 5 in Banjara Hills. A resident from Kukatpally Housing Board Colony said that his family and neighbours were living in fear until the snake in their apartment was rescued on Monday. “As people are not venturing out, they are spotting more snakes,” said Friends of Snake Society general secretary Avinash Visvanathan.
