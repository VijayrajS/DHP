NAGPUR: A 41-year-old man committed suicide on Wednesday allegedly after losing his job as a waiter in the current lockdown. Namdev Susendre, 41, committed suicide by hanging himself from the ventilator in his rented room in Adhyapak Layout. Pratap Nagar police have registered a case of accidental death.


According to police, Namdev used to live alone in a rented room in the house of Devashish Sable. Namdev worked as a waiter and was disturbed for sometime due to financial problems.

Cops said Namdev had told his house owner that he was depressed as he had lost his job at a Saoji restaurant which is shut in the lockdown. Cops said Namdev did not have enough money to survive. This might have driven him to take the drastic step.

The incident came to light when Devashish called Namdev but he did not respond. Namdev was found hanging by the house owner who informed Pratap Nagar police.
