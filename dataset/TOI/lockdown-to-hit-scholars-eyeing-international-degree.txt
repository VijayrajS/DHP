Lockdown to hit scholars eyeing international degree
2020-04-26
PUNE: With the lockdown being extended, students planning to go abroad for higher education are under stress about the future course of action. Also, the number of foreign students choosing to pursue courses in India may also decrease this year due to the pandemic, stated some college officials.

All universities are currently shut and they have postponed their examination schedule, which is expected to fuel further delays. However, representatives of agencies facilitating study-abroad programs said that delayed results will not affect admissions as the universities accept the final mark sheet till December.

Dilip Oak, who runs an organization that guides students seeking admission abroad, said despite the stress no student has cancelled his/her application yet. Oak said, “The semester starts in August and there is still plenty of time. Even if the lockdown is extended further, there is still time for embassies to complete the visa process. Moreover, since they earn revenue from students, they might give them priority when the consulate opens. The delay in university exams won’t affect admissions abroad because students can submit their documents till December.”

Varsities are also worried about the lockdown affecting students coming to India. “Admissions of foreign students will take a big hit this year. Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi and Bangalore attract a number of foreign students and these are also hotspots of Covid-19,” said Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society.
