High viral load: Only a few spread the most Covid-19 infections, reveals Ahmedabad's NIOH study

AHMEDABAD: An important revelation has been made on the Covid-19 viral transmission, just as the lockdown eases and migrants head to their home towns. The findings were released by the Ahmedabad-based ICMR-National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH). 


The institute studied samples from about 2,000 individuals of whom 140 were Covid-19 positive. It concluded that all Covid-19 infected patients do not transmit the virus to others uniformly. “It was observed that infected cases bearing a high viral load spread the infection at a rate almost eight times higher than cases with a low viral load,” says ICMR-NIOH director, Dr Kamalesh Sarkar. The study says that finding individuals with high viral and moderate viral loads and isolating and treating them can bring down the overall infection rate. 

 

The study was conducted between April and May. This is the first such study in the country.

Sarkar says that his team found that among 140 Covid-19 positive cases, those with a high viral load were limited to only 7% of the infected population. Moreover, 9% had a moderate viral load, whereas 84% of them had a low viral load. The ICMR-NIOH Ahmedabad team has suggested that Covid-19 patients with high and moderate viral loads should be isolated and hospitalized on priority. Those with a low viral load should be told to take all precautions, including social distancing. 

But how do you recognize Covid-19 cases with a high viral load? This, the NIOH team suggests, can be easily done if labs begin to officially record and report cycle threshold (Ct) values to authorities. This value is generated while doing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to confirm Covid-19 cases. “The Ct value is inversely proportional to the viral load of patients,” Sarkar says.
