MADURAI: Two men, who were under observation in the isolation wards for Covid-19 in the Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari government hospitals respectively, were discharged on Thursday night and Friday evening, after they tested negative for coronavirus. The two had recently returned from the Gulf.


The man admitted in the Government Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital (TVMCH) was identified as a 27-year-old from Chokkampatti village near Kadayanallur in Tenkasi district. He returned from Dubai on March 7 and was asymptomatic when he was checked in the airport on arrival. He later developed fever and cold and was admitted in the isolation ward at TVMCH on Monday.

He tested negative for malaria and typhoid, following which his blood samples were sent to Chennai for analysis two days ago. “We got the result on Thursday night and he tested negative. He was discharged the same night,” dean M Ravichandran said and added that the youth had fever only for a day.

At present, a 40-year-old Malaysian national is admitted in the TVMCH isolation ward for fever and uncontrolled diabetes. While the fever is settled, his diabetes is also getting under control, due to which there was no need to collect his samples for COVID-19 testing, the dean said. “He is likely to be discharged on Saturday,” Ravichandran added.

In Kanyakumari district, a 26-year-old man with recent travel history to Oman got himself admitted in the Kanyakumari Government Medical College and Hospital on Thursday afternoon fearing symptoms of Covid-19. “We collected swab samples from him and sent it to Chennai for testing. We got the result on Friday morning and he tested negative. So, he was discharged on Friday evening,” dean R Suganthy said.
