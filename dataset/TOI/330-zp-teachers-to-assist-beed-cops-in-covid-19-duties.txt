AURANGABAD: Responding to the request made by Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar, 330 teachers of Beed zilla parishad’s education department have been deployed to assist police force in performing Covid-19 duties. 

This is for the first time in the state that teachers are being deployed along with the police for coronavirus duties.

Depending on the requirement at each of the 27 police stations in the district, these teachers would be deployed for particular hours every day. Police authorities said that the teachers are being trained in taking appropriate precautions while being on duty. In addition, all the necessary gears are being provided to these teachers to rule out any possibility of getting infected.

“At border nakas, we have deployed Class 2 officers of other departments in eight hour shifts along with police. For containment zones, we are using a combination of police, home guards and teachers of the zilla parishad’s education department. This reduces the strain on police force which is already heavily taxed,” Poddar told TOI.

Considering the increasing number of Covid-19 patients in Beed district, district police chief sought the help of the teachers 

ZP chief executive officer Ajit Kumbhar said that based on the request made by the police department, 330 teachers have been deployed for assisting the police. “To avoid inconvenience to the teachers, they have been deputed to the police stations near their homes,” said Kumbhar.
