2020-03-26
Bhopal: Gwalior’s first COVID-19 positive patient has alleged that he has been ‘isolated in a filthy room’ with staff at Morar district hospital, most of whom do not follow precautions. 

The patient said that his condition will only worsen if he stays here for more days and now he is worried about his wife who is in the same ward. “I have been found corona positive and admitted at the isolation ward of Morar district hospital. There are too many problems here. No hygiene, no support, no food etc. Kindly take it seriously as I need to recover for which I require timely and healthy food as well as neat and clean room. Here, the staff is also not concerned about me, they don’t follow precautions even after my suggestion.. please take it seriously,” the 36-year-old salesman, who tested positive for the virus shared on WhatsApp. 

His wife is also in the same ward and her report is awaited. “She is now having fever and headache. Non-availability of western toilet is a major problem. I have no relative here. My wife is with me in isolation. I request you if you can help to arrange or deliver food in time,” he told TOI.

District administration, however, claims he is recovering fast and would be shifted to a better facility tonight. “We are trying our best for him. But at this hour everyone has to cooperate. We are preparing a 200-bed quarantine where he will also be shifted,” said district collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh and added, “His wife was in the same ward and we are waiting for her report.”

Four other samples have tested negative for the virus and 20 samples are pending. One suspect found unconscious on MP-Rajasthan border has been shifted to isolation ward. Sources say collector is getting 500 calls for samples per hour in Gwalior. Around 60 doctors are working 24X7 in shifts.
