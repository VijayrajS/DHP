2020-04-01
Nagpur: Lata Manageshkar Hospital (LMH) attached to NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences, city’s only private medical college, has now joined the fight against Covid-19. LMH Dean Dr Kajal Mitra said that hospital had reserved 350 beds for isolation of patients, ten Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds with ventilators and 13 High Dependency Units (HDUs). “Looking at the burden of patients at two government hospitals in city, LMH had offered to give our services in a meeting with divisional commissioner. Earlier, we created a ten-bed isolation ward for Covid-19 suspects. Now, we have extended the capacity to 350,” said Dr Mitra. LMH will not only admit the coronavirus suspects but also collect their samples for testing. In case found positive, the patient will be shifted to separate rooms where ICU and ventilators will also be available, if needed. LMH has also agreed to shift non-Covid-19 patients from GMCH and IGGMCH to their campus if these government hospitals require vacating some more beds for coronavirus patients. Campus of LMH hospital is situated at Digdoh hills on Hingna road which is comparatively far from city centre. This could be an advantage as chance of infection will reduce in case community spread of Covid-19 starts in Vidarbha. The hospital has 1,200 plus students of UG, PG and superspecialty courses. Added strength * At present, the Covid-19 patients/suspects are treated only at IGGMCH and GMCH* After 12 new patients found in city from March 26, the burden on these two hospitals increased* At present, these two hospitals together have 97 beds reserved for Covid-19 cases* Number of ventilators and ICU beds is very limited in both hospitals * LMH will offer 350-bedded isolation facility, 10 ICU beds with ventilators and 13 HDU beds * The hospital on Hingna road is also ready to shift and treat non-corona patients from GMCH and IGGMCH immediately
