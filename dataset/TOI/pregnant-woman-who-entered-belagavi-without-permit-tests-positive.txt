BELAGAVI: Police in Belagavi booked three people for allegedly concealing the arrival of a seven-month pregnant woman who tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.

The 27-year-old woman was clandestinely brought from Dharavi in Mumbai to Belagavi, her parentsâ€™ house, on May 6. Currently isolated at the dedicated Covid hospital, she had travelled along with her husband and a driver without permission. Her husband hails from Dharavi where coronavirus cases are increasing by the day.

Police booked her husband, brother and the car driver under the Disaster Management Act for concealing the information about their arrival and travelling without pass. Sources said they could have taken an alternative route to duck police surveillance and quarantine. The car left Mumbai in the morning and reached Sadashiva Nagar in Belagavi in the evening.

Her husband returned to Mumbai the same day. Even during the return journey, the car skipped police watch at border checkposts. Belagavi city police commissioner B S Lokesh Kumar has informed his counterpart in Mumbai about the lapses.

The administration, however, learnt about her arrival on May 12 during her visit to Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences for routine antenatal check-up. Deputy Commissioner S B Bommanahalli said doctors alerted the district administration after they went through the medical records that indicated her stay at Dharavi.

The health department is franticly working to trace the contact history and identified 10 people. All of them have been sent to institutional quarantine. The administration has notified Sadashiva Nagara as a containment zone and sealed off the area.
