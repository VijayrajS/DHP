PUNE: A 25-year-old man from Khadki, quarantined along with his brother and sister after all of them had come in contact with a Covid-19-positive person, jumped to his death from the third floor of a hospital at Bopodi on Thursday night.

Police inspector Shabbir Pathan of Khadki police station said the man was under tremendous stress after he and his siblings were quarantined at the hospital on Thursday morning. “He was panicky and the medical staff had counselled him,” he said.

Pathan said the three were quarantined after the man’s siblings showed symptoms of Covid-19. “The hospital authorities took the swabs of the trio in the afternoon. The reports are awaited.”

Pathan said the man left his hospital bed around 9pm, saying he wanted to go to the washroom. “However, he went to the third floor of the building and jumped down from an open corridor,” he said.

The police said the man jumped to his death when the power supply in the area was disrupted following the heavy rains that lashed the city in the evening. They said a hospital staffer saw the man lying on the ground and raised an alarm.

Pathan said the man would do odd jobs for a living. “We are registering a case of accidental death for now. We are investigating further,” he added.

TOI tried to reach out to the hospital authorities but got no response.
