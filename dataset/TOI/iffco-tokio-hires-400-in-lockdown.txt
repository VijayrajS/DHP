MUMBAI: Iffco Tokio General Insurance — the country’s fourth-largest private non-life company — has on-boarded 400 employees between March and May. The company’s board had decided to expand its network and had already received applications earlier this year. Some were given appointment letters and the hiring was to happen in the first quarter. But, with the lockdown getting extended, the company decided to complete the process over video calls and an app for induction of new staff.


The company has also gone ahead with annual increments at a time when many employers are scaling back employee costs. “We had a revision in salaries according to performance and vintage, ranging from 10% to 30% for all deserving employees. In our 20th year of operations, we wanted to retain all deserving employees and at the same time bring in fresh blood to meet new challenges in this new financial year,” said Ramesh Kumar, ED (HR, training, admin & CSR), Iffco Tokio General Insurance. 

According to the insurer, it has not scaled back any hiring plan despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The hiring were for sales and distribution in tier I to tier IV locations and some of the candidates were expected to work out of single-person offices. They also participated in an online induction training programme through a mobile learning app — iLeap. The company has arranged to have laptops delivered to the employees and most have started working remotely.

“We fulfilled our commitment to all the newly hired employees even during the lockdown period and on-boarded them through digital mode. This digital on-boarding helped us to complete the process in a seamless manner and keeping in view social-distancing norms. We also trained them digitally during the lockdown so that they are ready to be in the market as and when the norms are relaxed,” said Kumar.
