No fresh Covid-19 case in Jharkhand for second day as testing rate falls
2020-05-05
RANCHI: Jharkhand did not report a single new Covid-19 case for the second consecutive day on Monday, but sources said this could be deceptive as the number of tests being conducted fell significantly once the microbiology department at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) was shut down for four days on May 1 after a lab technician tested positive for the novel coronavirus on April 30


A total of 1,870 samples were tested in the state between May 1 and 4, compared to 2,318 tests conducted in the four days prior to the closure — a deficit of 448 samples. Rims is the biggest testing facility in the state and most samples from Ranchi, Jharkhand’s only red zone, were being tested here.

For the last four days, all the samples are being tested at just three centres. On April 30, a total of 680 samples werepending at Rims. Of these, 350-odd have been cleared from MGM hospital in Jamsedpur and T B Sanatorium in Itki. The results of 330 samples are pending.

State health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni said they will resume testing at Rims on Tuesday and will try to clear the backlog in two days. “We have received ICMR’s approval to resume tests at Rims. We will start testing samples at full strength from Tuesday.”

Kulkarni added, “A total of 479 samples were tested on Monday and all are negative. No patient recovered and the death toll stands at two,” said Kulkarni. The state’s coronavirus tally stays pegged at 115, of which 85 are active and 28 have made a full recovery.
