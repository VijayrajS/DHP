2020-05-23
NEW DELHI: On a day India saw yet another 24-hour peak in Covid-19 cases, the government said the lockdown has helped limit the concentration of cases to a few states and cities -- 80 percent reported in five states and 60 percent from the cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Thane.


Analysing active cases as on May 21, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul said Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh accounted for most of the incidence and if over 90% cases were considered, these came from 10 states.

“The confinement of Covid-19 to certain areas has been due to actions taken during the lockdown. It enabled us to be more prepared for the future,” Dr Paul said. Similarly, over 80% deaths were reported from five states – Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi and around 95% in 10 states, the government said, indicating much of the outbreak is confined to limited areas.

“This is no small achievement. It also gives us the confidence to open up other areas. Despite being such a large nation, due to lockdown, the coronavirus outbreak has remained confined to limited areas,” Dr Paul said. He added that a lockdown could not last for ever and an opening up needed adoption of safe practices. 

On Friday, the health ministry reported a total of 1,18,447 confirmed cases. Of this, 66,330 were under active medical supervision. In the last 24 hours, 6,088 cases were added till Friday morning. So far, a total of 48,533 people have been cured. In the last 24 hours, 3234 patients were found cured, taking the total recovery rate at 40.98%.
