Cops to file reports on ‘behaviour’ of Jamaat patients in Ghaziabad Covid hospital
2020-04-07
GHAZIABAD: Police will prepare two reports a day on the “behaviour” of Tablighi Jamaat members isolated at the CHS Hospital at Muradnagar after they tested positive for Covid-19 and submit them to the district magistrate. 

Police had not received any complaint from the hospital about the patients. “The hospital staff didn’t complain about them, but in the presence of cops, the Jamaati people will not take a chance,” said Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani.

The hospital, which has 20 Covid-19 patients, has a separate isolation ward for members of Tablighi Jamaat — there are 13 as of now. “On Sunday afternoon, some of them started offering namaaz inside the isolation ward. When we asked them to maintain a distance of 2m from each other, they didn’t listen to us,” a hospital official said.

“Police officers deployed at the CHC Hospital will check their behaviour six times in 12 hours, on the basis of which a report will be sent to the circle officer, the SSP and the district magistrate,” said OP Singh, station house officer of Muradnagar police station.

Till now, police have identified 17 employees of Cease Fire, the other big cluster of Covid-19 cases, and 250 who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation. “All are in quarantine under the eye of the police and health department,” said Naithani.

A complaint of harassment and misbehaviour by patients who had attended the congregation had been filed by the MMG District Hospital last week, on the basis of which five men were booked under the National Security Act — which allows detention up to 12 months without a charge. After that, cops had been stationed and CCTV cameras installed at every quarantine centre and isolation ward in Ghaziabad.
