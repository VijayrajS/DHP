2020-04-03
MANGALURU: Even as the whole world is going crazy whipping up the flamboyant Dalgona coffee during the lockdown and sharing it on Twitter and Instagram, in Mangaluru, caffeine lovers swear by Kalladka tea or KT. Some have started preparing KT as a lockdown challenge.


A few days ago, Dalgona coffee, which gets its name from a Korean spongy toffee, went viral as a lockdown drink. Many people prepared the drink and uploaded the same on social media. However, Mangalureans who are attached to KT, started a campaign to promote the homegrown innovation. The campaign became a lockdown challenge.

Praveenchandra Shetty, an insurance surveyor, who has thrown the challenge open to his friends to prepare KT, and upload the same on social media, said that his challenge was accepted by 16 friends so far. “It’s a friendly challenge. Now, ‘accept the challenge’ is the new slang for, do it yourself and learn,” says Praveenchandra, who has been preparing KT since 1991. “I have been preparing KT since 1991. Tea makers from Kalladka taught me to master making KT, when I went there for a survey.”

Shetty has made the recipie for KT available on his social media account. “Along with how to prepare it, I have written about the science behind it,” he said.

While normal tea has a frothy creamy layer of milk atop the tea, KT has a one-fourth layer of thick tea decoction sitting atop thick milk. KT originated in a small eatery near Kalladka at Hotel Laxmi Nivas, which dates back six decades.

Food blogger Laxmi Shenoy said that Dalgona coffee is visual delight, but KT is a real beauty. “Dalgona coffee is a visual delight, but we Mangalureans already have the beautiful KT from Kalladka. The tea is in ombre with a frothy top, with the decoction at the centre and a milky bottom, and has been a delight for whoever has tried it.”
