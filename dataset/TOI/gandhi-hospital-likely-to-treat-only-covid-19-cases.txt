HYDERABAD: The government has decided to convert Gandhi Hospital into a full-fledged facility to treat only novel coronavirus patients if the number of Covid-19 positive cases see a spurt. Health minister Eatala Rajender on Thursday asked health department officials to make the necessary arrangements in Gandhi Hospital and directed the director of medical education to shift all the departments to Osmania General Hospital by this month-end.


As many as 45 people had tested positive for the coronavirus in Telangana and nine of them had contracted the virus through others. In the wake of rise in the number of positive cases, he asked the officials to come up with a list of requirement for additional equipment and manpower at Gandhi Hospital. 

“Elective surgeries have already stopped at Gandhi and patients are referred to OGH. Shifting of other departments from Gandhi to OGH should be completed by March-end. King Koti hospital should also be kept ready to treat coronavirus patients,” Rajender said. 

A committee has been constituted headed by Kaloji Health University vice-chancellor Karunakar Reddy to utilise the services of private hospitals and private medical colleges. “If the number of patients keep rising, we would first need personal protection kits, ventilators and other equipment.” He directed MD of Telangana State Medical Infrastructure Development Corporation Chandrasekhar Reddy to place orders for the equipment immediately. 

He asked health and police officials to send surveillance teams mainly to monitor people under home quarantine. “No leaves will be given to PHC staff and Asha workers. Food and transportation should be provided to them,” he said.
