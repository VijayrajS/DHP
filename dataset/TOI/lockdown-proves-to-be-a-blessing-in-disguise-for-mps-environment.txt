Lockdown proves to be a blessing in disguise for MP’s environment
2020-06-06
BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh celebrated this year’s Environment Day in true sense as air quality of its major cities — Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur — on Friday was better than ever before. It was graded as cleanest by the central pollution control board.

Air quality index that measures pollution levels has been cut down to half in MP cities, if compared before and after lockdown. Comparison of air quality before lockdown on March 20 and Friday points that air quality of major cities have turned from moderate, satisfactory to good.





Ambient air quality is measured by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) taking into account values of PM 2.5, PM 10, NO2, NH3, SO2, CO and Ozone.The air quality index of Bhopal was 116 on March 20 that reduced to 49. AQI of Indore was 163 that cut down to 48. In Gwalior the AQI dipped from 96 to 39 and in Jabalpur AQI came down to 41 from 70. Figures also suggest that pollution levels came down more in the cities with maximum corona positives — Indore and Bhopal than Gwalior and Jabalpur. 

Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others. PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.

CPCB data hint that air quality of major MP cities improved to two levels. Officials said lockdown helped in cutting down pollution levels to unexpected levels in the lockdown.
