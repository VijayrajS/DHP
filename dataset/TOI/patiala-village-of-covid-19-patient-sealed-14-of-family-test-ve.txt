SHAMBHU (PATIALA): Patiala district administration sealed Ramnagar Sainiyan village on Sunday, a day after a 21-year-old man from there tested positive for coronavirus at Haryana’s Ambala city civil hospital. 


Health teams shifted 14 family members of the patient to Government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala and placed them in isolation. Their samples tested negative for coronavirus, said Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra.

Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit and SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu, along with other officials, visited the village in the morning.

The patient, who returned to India from Nepal on March 20, was admitted to Ambala civil hospital on March 26. His family members have been kept in isolation as a precaution. Dr Malhotra said, “No family member had so far shown any symptoms of coronavirus.” 

The DC also interacted with the village sarpanch and locals, and asked them to approach health officials in case any local showed symptoms associated with Covid-19. The SSP said police teams had been deployed at all entry and exit points of the village and a round-the-clock vigil was being maintained to ensure individuals from other areas did not come in contact with the local population.

Police laid barricades around the village. 

The civil surgeon said health teams under epidemiologist Dr Sumit Singh conducted a survey of the village and generated health charts of locals. Four health surveillance teams and two medical teams have also been deployed at the village. They are spraying sodium hypochloride to disinfect the village.

An advisory has also been issued in adjoining villages.

The patient had earlier complained of a stomach ache. He also had headache, loose motions and fever, and no respiratory problem at first. He works for a private firm in Chandigarh, but did not attend work due to the lockdown.
