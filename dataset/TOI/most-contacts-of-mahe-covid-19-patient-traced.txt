KOZHIKODE: As many as 60 persons who had come into contact with the woman hailing from Mahe and who had tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday have been identified and are kept under observation, district collector Sabasiva Rao said.

The famous Pattala Palli in Kozhikode has decided to indefinitely stop the customary daily prayers and the Friday congregations to prevent mass assembly of people in view of the Covid-19 situation.
