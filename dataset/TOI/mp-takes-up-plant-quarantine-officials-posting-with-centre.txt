2020-03-10
Trichy: Su Thirunavukkarasar, MP has taken up with the Centre the non-availability of a dedicated officer at the Trichy airport to issue plant quarantine certificate to authorize export of perishable products. He met Union minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar recently and pointed out the difficulties faced by exporters at the airport due to this.

Perishable commodities like vegetables, fruits and flowers constitute 85% of the total volume of consignments sent from Trichy airport predominantly to Singapore, Dubai, Sharjah, Kuala Lumpur and Colombo. The remaining 15% of exports is of non-perishables like garments and pharma products. 

However, exporters have been hamstrung by the non-availability of dedicated certifying officials for perishable products which need a phytosanitary certificate from the plant quarantine department under the ministry of agriculture. Customs officials clear the consignments only on furnishing the certificate. In the absence of a proper office and officials at the cargo terminal, exporters have to go to the plant quarantine office located at Khajamalai, 4 kilometres away from the airport. This also delays their consignments, said the president of express courier operators association, S A Sayeed.

“The signing authorities are available only on weekdays at the plan quarantine office between 7 am and 3 pm, not on weekends. Also, with no dedicated officer, officials in charge have been coming from Chennai or Kochi, which sometimes causes losses to the exporters.
