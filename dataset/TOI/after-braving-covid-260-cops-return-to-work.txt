Additional commissioner of police Prem Anand Sinha and east Chennai joint commissioner of police R Sudhakar are among those tasked with overseeing the needs of the recovered personnel.

Commissioner iswanathan said, “I talk to police personnel admitted to the corona special ward at Mahanadhi Hostel on the IIT-Madras campus to give them confidence.” He has also asked other officers to spend at least 10-15 minutes a day talking to each covid-infected policeman or woman, instilling hope in them.

“We have asked all police personnel aged above 55 and those above 50 with serious ailments to remain at home,” said an officer, adding that at least 4,000 personnel across the state have been identified in the above two categories for ‘home stay’.
