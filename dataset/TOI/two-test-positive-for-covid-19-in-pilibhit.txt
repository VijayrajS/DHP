Pilibhit: Two people on Tuesday tested positive for novel coronavirus in Pilibhit, confirmed health department officials.

The positive cases include a 35-year-old man who returned to a village under Bisalpur Kotwali police station in Pilibhit from Delhi, while another is a 24-year-old resident of a village under Puranpur kotwali, who had recently returned from Mumbai. Both reports were issued by Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences.

Additional chief medical officer Dr CM Chaturvedi said villagers and the pradhan concealed the information from officials during the inquiry.

District magistrate Vaibhav Shrivastav, too, held the gram pradhan responsible for concealing the information.

“We are seizing her financial powers with immediate effect as a punishment. She might also be subjected to further legal action,” said DM.

Dr Chaturvedi said one of the positive cases, along with four others, was shifted to Agrawal Sabha Bhawan in Bisalpur tehsil. “We collected the samples of all five people on May 9 and sent them for test the next day. Of the five people, one tested positive and one negative, while the reports of three others are still awaited.

“The 35-year-old infected man was shifted to an isolation ward in Bareilly on Tuesday night. The 24-year-old youth would also be shifted to Bareilly, soon,” said Chaturvedi.
