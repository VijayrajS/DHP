KOLKATA: Driver of a Karma ambulance that serves Kolkata Police allegedly left from a spot in the Bagha Jatin-Ganguly Bagan area when he was asked to take a man, who had returned from Australia recently, to the ID Hospital at Beliaghata on Sunday morning. The incident took place in the presence of officers from Patuli PS. 


Locals said the ambulance driver fled the moment he heard that the man, who had been suffering from fever, could be a Covid-19 patient. Finally, cops and local councillor Debasish Mukherjee arranged for an alternative vehicle to send him for a test at the ID Hospital. 

Cops said the man, a resident of Ward 99, had returned from Australia on March 18. At airport, he was asked to stay in home quarantine. 

On Sunday morning, his neighbours found him moving around on the road, instead of staying in isolation. 

Locals alerted the police who called the Karma ambulance. A local said, “The man has been advised home isolation.”
