Pilibhit: A 73-year-old woman who returned to Pilibhit from Saudi Arabia last month carrying Covid-19 infection, has tested negative after undergoing treatment in the isolation ward of district government hospital for the past two weeks.The recovery is a minor miracle, considering the age of the patient, when the immune system is expected to weaken drastically. Her test report from the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) was received by the health department on Sunday night.However, the 33-year-old son of the elderly woman continues to fight with the infection, after his second test report confirmed him to be still positive.“We’ve sent a third sample of the elderly woman to KGMU on Monday, and if it too tests negative, she will be released,” said Dr C M Chaturvedi, the additional chief medical officer in Pilibhit.Her son will be tested again next week to gauge the degree of improvement in his condition. Chaturvedi said he hoped the son, whose health was showing signs of improvement, will test negative in the next test.Besides the woman and her son, seven other people suspected of carrying the infection, who had returned to Pilibhit from Delhi on March 21, have also tested negative for the virus. Elsewhere, a health department team shifted four residents of Punjabiyan locality under Pilibhit Kotwali police station with the help of police, to the government quarantine facility on Monday.The administration was alerted about them by neighbours, as they had concealed their travel history information.
