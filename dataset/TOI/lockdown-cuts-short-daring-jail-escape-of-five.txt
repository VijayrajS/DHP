Lockdown cuts short daring jail escape of five in Gujarat's Surendranagar
2020-05-14
RAJKOT: High drama was witnessed in Surendranagar district on Wednesday when five undertrials made a daring escape from Dhrangadhra sub-jail early in the morning. However, they ran out of luck due to lockdown and were caught within hours as they failed to get any transport to execute their escapade.


Those who escaped include four brothers — Nanji Devipujak, Santu Devipujak, Savji Devipujak and Dharam Devipujak — and one Prakash Kushwaha. 

They broke the lock of the barrack at around 4am which they also took along with them. After leaving the barrack, they climbed up the terrace and with the help of bed sheets they got down. However, when Kushwaha was climbing down, he slipped and fell on a plastic shed. Hearing the noise, inmates of the old building woke up and started clanking utensils to alert the jail staff. 

“However, before the three constables deployed as the guards at the jail could come, the five had already escaped,” said BM Desai, police inspector, Dhrangadhra police station. 

But having failed to get additional wheels to gather mileage for their further journey, the five started on foot on the Dhrangadhra-Viramgam highway. They had walked around 12 km and were nabbed around 3:30pm. 

Deepak Dhol, inspector, Surendranagar local crime branch, said, “We got information from some locals about five persons moving around suspiciously near Vavdi village and nabbed them.”

While the four brothers had planned to hide in their native Dasada village, Kushwaha wanted to return to Indore in Madhya Pradesh. He was booked in a loot and theft case. The Devipujak brothers were accused in a murder case. 

Dhrangadhra sub-jail houses 90 inmates — 56 in old building and 34 in new building.

This is the second incident of jail break in Surendranagar. On the night of January 12, four prisoners had escaped from Limbdi sub-jail, but were caught later.
