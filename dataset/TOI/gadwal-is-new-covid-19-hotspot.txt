Hyderabad: Gadwal, a small district carved out from erstwhile Mahbubnagar, with about seven lakh population is now one of the hotspots for novel coronavirus. As many as 45 cases have been reported from the district and one or two cases are being added almost every day.

Officials said till March 31, there was not a single case in the district. Soon, cases began to mount, especially after those who attended Tablighi Jamaat meeting came out. Now, officials are worried about spreading of virus from neighbouring Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh.

Of the total 45 cases, two pertained to those who had gone to see a doctor in Kurnool 10 days ago. The doctor has also tested positive now. “Gadwal town accounted for eight (one discharged) cases. Rest came from Waddepally, Moogavanipally, Vallur and other villages. Over 1,000 people, who are primary and secondary contacts of positive cases, are under home quarantine. Only those with symptoms are being sent to government quarantine,” Gadwal district additional collector P Srinivas Reddy told TOI.

One family had four positive cases and all of them are under surveillance. Over 50 persons, who attended Markaz from the district, have been tested, Srinivas said.

With Gadwal among top five districts for coronavirus cases, government appointed a special officer a few days ago. Various wards in Gadwal municipality have been categorised into clusters and sealed. “We pasted red stickers at homes where suspected cases are there. A team of officers visits every house to check whether any person is developing symptoms,” the additional collector said.
