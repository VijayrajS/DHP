Relaxation in lockdown results in panic buying
2020-04-02
MANGALURU: A nine-hour window to purchase essentials starting 6am on Tuesday, after the 78-hour total lockdown that the Dakshina Kannada district administration imposed to control Covid-19 cases in the district, saw serpentine queues of people outside grocery stores and vegetable shops. The irony of this move was not lost on the authorities, as social distancing went for a toss, despite repeated pleas by harried policemen deputed to control people at these spots.


Even the assertion by district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari, that the prices of essential items will be controlled, was a non-starter, just as the move mooted by Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel to supply essentials to the doorsteps of people is still in the works. A meeting that the Mangaluru City Corporation(MCC) had with wholesalers and retailers for doorstep delivery, and contact numbers of such vendors being distributed to the people, too did not work out, with no response being received from the given numbers, when people tried calling.

On the other hand, queues for milk and newspapers was thin, given that these items were exempted during the lockdown period. With transportation of vegetables from Central Market to suburban markets being a major issue, prices at these markets put them out of reach for most. “The market was flooded with vegetables, but the crowd was too much to handle. Police came and asked all the shops at Central Market to close down,” was widely commented on WhatsApp.

At Kadri, traffic on the four-lane two-way road was restricted to a one-way two-lane road, to help people buy vegetables. Chairs were placed on the road for people to sit, to ensure that social distancing norms were adhered to. In other places, such as the Hopcoms outlet and vegetable market at Karangalpady, it was each one for himself. Given the chaos, netizens urged the district administration to take a few lessons from neighbouring Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts.

The administration that later relaxed purchasing hours from Wednesday, decided that retailers could source vegetables from the wholesale Central Market from 11pm to 4am, and sell in their areas from 7am to 1pm. The market premises will be off limits for the public and guarded by police. Even sales in the constricted Surathkal Market premises has been banned, stated an official note from the department of information and public relations.
