AMU hospital to buy second machine for testing Covid-19 cases
2020-03-24
Agra: With the steady growth of Covid-19 cases across the country, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has decided to buy a second machine, worth Rs 35 lakh, for its medical college and hospital on Monday to enhance the testing procedure. UP has so far reported 29 positive cases.

Confirming this, spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said that as AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC) is one of the five authorised centres to carry out tests for novel coronavirus across the state by ICMR, the university has decided to get another machine following the rise in number of screening samples of suspected cases with symptoms and travel history to the affected countries.

Currently, the medical college has one machine for testing Covid-19 virus. This machine takes six hours to diagnose 15 samples and 60 reports can be prepared in a day. However, after buying a new machine, the number of tests and reports will increase.

Medical superintendent of AMU’s medical college Prof Haris Manzoor Khan said that, so far, around 169 samples have been received in the lab for testing. Of these, 123 have been processed. Four out of these have tested positive, including two from Noida and one each from Agra and Moradabad. He said, “The remaining 46 samples are under process.”

According to health authorities, samples for screening are being received from almost every district of western Uttar Pradesh such as Agra, Moradabad, Mainpuri, Mathura, Etah and Kasganj. However, bulk samples have been received only from Noida.

The virology lab for testing viruses at JNMC was established by ICMR two years ago, said officials. Other authorised laboratories in the state are King George’s Medical University (KGMU) and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) in Lucknow, Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur and Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Varanasi.
