Indore: As the lockdown has been extended till May 3 and demand of grocery, medicines and other essential commodities has only been growing, the district administration has come up with a few plans to ensure home delivery without any hassle. 

“A list of wholesale vegetable traders will be prepared and for door-to-door supply, packaging facilities will be set up around 20 km away from the city in areas like Mhow, Depalpur, Khandwa Road,” divisional commissioner Akash Tripathi said. 

He added that a ward and zone-wise plan will be prepared to ease door-to-door supply of vegetables through loading auto-rickshaws while permission will not be given to sell the same through handcarts or in the market. 

Tripathi on Wednesday held a meeting with wholesale traders of vegetable, grocery, medicine and representatives of transport association. 

He issued permission to grocery wholesalers to supply the items through their godown to retailers to make them available at doorstep of the consumers. 

After receiving complaints of a large number of people turning up at Dawa Bazaar to purchase medicines, he instructed to deploy cops at the entry gate while retailers will only be given entry. Besides, employees of Dawa Bazaar will be issued passes and IMC has been instructed to sanitize Dawa Bazaar building. 

For transporters, Tripathi instructed that movement of the drivers will be allowed after they produce heavy-vehicle licence and an ID-Card issued by transporter. Besides, drivers will be provided medical checkup along with masks and sanitizers by the medical team at toll tax barrier. 

Meanwhile, district collector Manish Singh has made it clear that permission to go out of the city will only be provided on two conditions including to the patient after they will be discharged from the hospital and close relatives of those, who died in other cities, to participate in the last rites.
