HYDERABAD: Despite the consistent rise in Covid-19 cases, many IT employees are still working out of their offices in Hyderabad. According to some employees, while a few companies asked their their staff to work from home, on Thursday, many others went about business as usual.


Though companies are implementing measures to maintain high levels of hygiene at the workplace by making hand sanitizers available for everyone and screening their temperature, employees say that they are under constant risk as several offices are located in concentrated areas with thousands of employees in each building.

“I don’t think just checking our temperature and providing hand sanitizers will stop the virus from spreading,” said an IT professional. Another employee said, “DLF building in Gachibowli sees huge crowds gathering at the canteen during lunch break. I think it is time all the IT companies make work-from-home mandatory for employees.” 

“Until last week, we wanted to run offices normally without creating a panic but we decided to give work-from-home to our employees since the past two days. While all the major companies are taking a decision based on corporate directives, small and medium companies might take time to follow, especially those who don’t have resources for work-from-home,” said HYSEA president, Ranga Pothula.
