BMC tells hospitals to add oxygen lines to Covid-19 beds
2020-04-26
MUMBAI: An important decision has been taken during a high-level meeting held by the civic chief to ensure that every Covid-19 bed in the city has an oxygen line.




 A review of patients showed that Covid causes a drop in oxygen levels. “If we give oxygen to patients who are moderately ill, doctors believe there is a chance the patient’s condition won’t deteriorate and he or she may not need mechanical ventilation,” said a BMC official. 

The number of coronapositive cases in the city may touch 75,000 by May-end, according to projections that the BMC has worked out by extrapolating current trends. The majority of these — 63,000 positive patients — will have no symptoms of fever or cough but 12,000 could have serious symptoms, including breathlessness. 

Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi told TOI the focus is on ensuring that adequate infrastructure is available for a five-digit patient pool. Apart from ramping up bed capacity in civic, state and private hospitals, plans are afoot to keep asymptomatic patients in hotels, lodges and mega-facilities created within marriage halls, gymkhanas and sports complexes. The jumbo facilities will include the Goregaon Exhibition Centre, where 1,240 beds with oxygen supply are being readied. “Five-hundred beds at NSCI, Worli, will also be provided with such beds,” said a civic official. 

Such government hospitals include St George’s Hospital, which now has 110 beds with oxygen lines, but will be ramped up to 225, and GT Hospital, which has 50 beds, that will be increased to 180 (see graphic for details). The BMC is also trying to increase the capacity of the dedicated Covid hospital SevenHills to 1,300 beds by May 10. 

In the private sector, institutions where beds with oxygen lines will be augmented include Bombay Hospital in Marine Lines and Fortis Hospital in Mulund.
