15 quarantine cells come up in Central Jail
2020-03-28
Nagpur: The Central Jail here has created a facility of 15 quarantine cells. There are about 2,512 inmates in the jail.

The ward was created after civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar visited the jail on Thursday. It’s learnt that the jail authorities intend to keep prisoners in quarantine if they show any coronavirus symptoms. 

The jail authorities plan to spray sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) in the entire premises. At present, the process of procurement and spraying modalities are being worked out. 

The state government had sounded a caution regarding the likely outbreak of the coronavirus at prisons. With the state constantly upgrading facilities to fight the coronavirus, jails in Maharashtra too have started preparations.

Jail superintendent Anup Kumre said a convict with fever was shifted to the quarantine ward and then to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for a routine check-up. “We are keeping a keen watch on the health of the inmates and already have taken adequate precautionary measures,” he said. 

Kumre also said that Dr Paturkar was satisfied with the arrangements. “We had taken him on an inspection of facilities. I will soon submit a report before the committee in which the civil surgeon is the member-secretary,” he said. 

The jail superintendent also rejected the claims of an anonymous letter, supposedly penned by a released inmate, criticizing the arrangements to fight corona. The letter, now in possession of TOI, had stated that there were no proper hygiene and prevention facilities, like adequate hot water, to wash clothes and take bath in the jail. 

Kumre said that the letter was written by someone disgruntled who wanted to mislead the media.
