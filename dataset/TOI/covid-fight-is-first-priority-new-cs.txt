2020-06-02
Thiruvananthapuram: Senior IAS officer Vishwas Mehta took over as the 46th chief secretary of the state here on Monday. He assumed charge from Tom Jose, who retired from the service on Sunday.

After assuming the charge at 9.35am, the IAS officer from the 1986-batch said his immediate priority is on government’s initiatives in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. He said it is not enough if the government alone is engaged in fighting the pandemic, but it should be a people’s movement.

Urging the people to be cautious, Mehta said every citizen should ensure that the pandemic does not spread, especially when more people are returning to the state from elsewhere in the country and abroad. “Until there is a vaccine to eradicate the pandemic, we will not be able to relax,” he said.

Mehta also participated in a high-level meeting chaired by the chief minister with regards to Covid-19 control measures.

Other than his wife Preeti Mehta, additional chief secretaries T K Jose, Asha Thomas, R K Singh, Teeka Ram Meena, state police chief Loknath Behera and other secretaries were present during the charge handing-over ceremony. Mehta will hold the office till February 28 next year.

Outgoing chief secretary Jose said he is stepping down after a satisfying stint as the chief secretary. Jose said he was part of government’s fight during the floods, Nipah outbreak and Covid-19. He said he has also been able to successfully initiate projects for waste management in the state.
