Lockdown pastime: Family digs well to solve water problem of residents in locality
2020-05-22
Mangaluru: In a commendable act, six members of a Muslim family made use of their unpaid holidays during the lockdown to quench the thirst of residents of their colony at a village in Belthangady taluk. They dug a well in the colony, which will prove to be a permanent solution to the water crisis residents face during summer.

About 75 families live in Janata Colony at Karambaru in Banthadka village. The only source of water in the locality was a public well, dug by the government years ago, which would go dry during summer. 

When Covid-19 lockdown rendered many youths in the village jobless, 24-year-old Aboobakker Siddiq, who is a plasterer by occupation, thought of utilising the free time usefully by digging a well in the family. When he shared his thoughts with his family, his father Hassainar, brothers Ashraf, Sadiq, Shamsuddin and Sirajuddin too agreed to shoulder the responsibility. 

Siddiq told TOI that the new well dug by the family will be a permanent solution to the drinking water problem in the locality in the summer. “All of us in the colony have been depending on the public open well for the past several years. We have been facing drinking water crisis every year during peak summer. We made several requests to the local authorities to sanction a well for the colony. However, our demand was not fulfilled. Meanwhile, when the lockdown made all of us jobless, the idea of digging a well in our property was mooted. Initially, six of us from our family started the work. Later, neighbours too joined hands to pull ropes and remove debris. At 40 feet, we found water and now it is being used by us and others in the locality,” Siddiq said.
