2020-03-29
Mysuru: Five more Covid-19 positive cases were confirmed in Nanjangud town, forcing the district administration to shut down the temple town from Saturday night after classifying it as a ‘cluster case’, a first in Karnataka.

The number of Covid-19 positive cases in the town now stands at eight.

Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Shankar said that among these five new positive cases, four are residents of Chamundi Pura Extension, Ramaswamy Layout and Govind Raj Layout in Nanjanagud town. 

This is the first time a small town is hit by the virus with such proportions. All are suspected to have contracted the virus from an employee who is working in a pharma company located in the industrial area in Nanjangud.

The fith person is a resident of Yaraganahalli New Extension in Mysuru, which is another cause of concern for authorities.

“All are employed in the Jubilant Nanjanagudu facility, and were contacts of P52 who tested positive recently (3rd positive of Mysuru),” the DC said. As of now, all are stable, he added.

The first case in Nanjangud was detected on Thursday and five more cases surfaced within 48 hours.

“Nanjangud town is a cluster case now and containment measures will be initiated as per procedure. Vehicle movement into and out of the town will be restricted from Saturday night. Measures are being put in place to contain the outbreak. Residents are requested to cooperate during these times of crisis,” the DC stated.
