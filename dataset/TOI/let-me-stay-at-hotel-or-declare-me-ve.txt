Ahmedabad: ‘Let me stay at hotel or declare me Covid-19 negative’
2020-05-13
AHMEDABAD: It could have been a moment of elation for Hardik Shah. He is a cashier with a nationalized bank. The management of a hotel in western Ahmedabad told him that he would be going back home after 25 days of hospitalization and isolation following a positive test. 

Instead, Shah is requesting the authorities to allow him stay at the hotel. Shah’s final test was not conducted, and he fears that he could be a carrier for the viral infection for his three-year-old daughter or his father-in-law who is in his late seventies.

Under new national guideline for discharge of Covid-19 positive patients, a record 466 patients were discharged on Tuesday including 392 from Ahmedabad. Carrying out tests on asymptomatic patients is not necessary now as the persons have to follow self-isolation for seven days.

“I developed fever on April 7 and it continued for a week. I then got myself tested and got to know that I was Covid-19 positive,” said Shah. “I got admitted to SVP Hospital where I got tested on April 19, 26 and 29. As I did not have any symptoms, I was advised to get shifted to Samras Hostel. But I decided to move to a hotel as Covid-19 positive patient.”

His two subsequent tests — on May 5 and 7 — also turned out to be positive. “I was to be tested again this week, but I was told that under the new guidelines if I have spent 10 days without symptoms, I can go home,” he said. 

“I told the AMC officials that social distancing is not possible as I live with my aged father-in-law, wife and daughter in a one-bedroom house and I don’t have a separate toilet.” Shah said that he doesn’t want to become a carrier. “Stigma towards Covid-19 is still high and I don’t know what will happen if I go to the society without the assurance that I am not positive. I have requested the authorities to let me stay at hotel or conduct a test,” he said.
