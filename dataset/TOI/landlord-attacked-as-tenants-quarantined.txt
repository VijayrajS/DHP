Ahmedabad: A 33-year-old resident of Gomtipur, Sunil Parmar, has lodged a complaint at Gomtipur police station on Wednesday alleging that three persons Chirag Chavda, Bhavesh Kapadia and Anand Kapadia beat him up and then stoned his house, simply because his tenants were put under home quarantine. Parmar was seriously injured and needed ten stitches on the top of his left eye.

According to the FIR, his tenants had gone to Nepal and were home quarantined on their return. AMC authorities pasted a red poster at the front of his house, which stated that the house’s inhabitants were quarantined.

Parmar, who works as a security guard, stated that the accused used to frequently tell him to evict his quarantined tenants.

On Tuesday night, the accused met him at the entrance of the society and started calling him “Coronavirus”. “He said he had not been quarantined but his tenants had. The accused then started abusing him and attacked him. Other residents of the area rescued him. When he was returning home, the accused pelted him with stones. One stone hit him above the left eye,” said inspector C B Tandel of Gomtipur police station.
