NEW DELHI: A Gallup survey of 1,000 Indians has shown than 83% respondents reacted positively to a question on how well they thought their government is handling the coronavirus pandemic. 


The survey, which does not specify whether the government in question is the Union government or the states, in the Indian setup, has retuned figures which are among the highest approval rating for a government among populations across surveyed countries. The highest approval rate for the government was in Austria, where 88% of the 1,000 people question said the government handled the pandemic well. 

In the case of India, 39% strongly agreed with the governments’ tackling of the virus, while 44% agreed that they were doing well. About 4% people strongly disagreed that the government was handling the situation well and 9% were less vehement in their disagreement.

The lowest approval rates, however, were in Thailand, Japan and Ecuador, followed closely by USA and Germany, where the survey showed more people disapproved of the government’s handling of the virus than those that backed the state. In the USA, 46% people disagreed that their government was handling the pandemic well, while 12% said they did not know, or chose not to respond.
