Kolhapur: The city is set to witness a low-key affair Akshay Tritiya on April 26 this year.People usually buy gold, new vehicles and even property on this auspicious day. But given the current crisis, high sales will not be possible this time. The day is also considered to be auspicious for weddings, but with the outbreak has put a halt on all social gatherings.Bharat Oswal, the president of Kolhapur District Jewellers’ Association, said, “Akshay Tritiya is an auspicious day when people go out to buy gold jewellery. We were expecting the government to relax some rules and allow certain business activities to start after April 20. But considering the stringent restrictions, the jewellery shops will remain close and we will miss some business opportunity on Akshay Tritiya this year.”“On an average, the city records business of around Rs 30 crore during Akshay Tritiya,” he said.Sachin Mali, a resident of Ujalaiwadi said, “Every year we visit jewellery shops on Akshay Tritiya and buy gold depending our financial capability. But this year, the tradition will be discontinued as all the shops will remain shut due to the lockdown and we are not allowed to step out of our houses apart from going out to get groceries.”
