Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, Mustafa along with 500-odd more from Tamil Nadu were quarantined in Delhi. They were kept in various places including the police quarters in Sultanpur, where Mustafa was quarantined.

On Wednesday morning, a friend of Mustafa’s son who was also quarantined in Sultanpur telephoned the family members to informed them that Mustafa fell unconscious and was being rushed to a hospital in an ambulance. Hours later, the family was informed that Mustafa died without responding to treatment. 

Manithaneya Makkal Katchi president M H Jawahirullah said in a statement that Mustafa was tested for Covid-19 twice in Delhi and the results were negative and charged that those quarantined there were not given proper care. Mustafa was a diabetic. “His wife told me that Mustafa and others are not being given proper food and medical attention,’’ he said, demanding that the Tamil Nadu government representatives should pay attention to the complaints of the quarantined people there.
