Vijayawada: No liquor! Demand for toddy on a high during lockdown
2020-04-03
VIJAYAWADA: With the non-availability of liquor, the demand for toddy has increased bringing relief to the beleaguered toddy tappers in the state. In Akumarru village of Gudur mandal in Krishna district, villagers throng to buy toddy from the local store early in the morning almost every day since the lockdown was announced.


Social distancing goes for a toss as a long queue can be seen outside the shop. Meanwhile, local villagers remain wary of the sight of several unknown persons all the way from Bandar coming to the village to taste toddy. Normally, toddy tappers climb palm trees once a day to gather their production for their daily business. Now, they claim that they have to do it three times with the rising demand.

“Normally, toddy demand is during the summer season, till May. Initially during the lockdown, we barely saw any business. But, now we are seeing an increase in the crowd to buy toddy,” Kalyan Ram, a toddy tapper said. This naturally brewed liquor has been a popular beverage across Krishna, Guntur, West and East Godavari districts.

While some of the toddy businesses have remained open, by and large, most of the outlets across these districts continue to remain shut due to the lockdown. Andhra Pradesh Kallugeeta Karmika Sangham (Toddy Tappers Association) have already placed a demand with the government seeking compensation for the losses caused by the pandemic.

“Business has been good in the last few days as people have bought around 20 to 25 litres of toddy within hours. However, we fear that soon restrictions would be in place for this as well,” Ram added.

Officials point out that toddy collection does come under the essential supplies category as it is part of agriculture which is permitted to continue. However, crowd gathering at any place without appropriate precautions does stand as a violation of National Disaster Management Act 2005.
