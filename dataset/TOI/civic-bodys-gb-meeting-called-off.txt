2020-03-14
AURANGABAD: The meeting of the civic administration’s general body scheduled for Friday has been cancelled in the wake of the outbreak of coronavirus. Usually, around 250 to 300 individuals gather for the meeting. 


Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said on Friday that the threat of coronavirus outbreak loomed large in Aurangabad. “While the state has had quite a few patients who have been infected with the virus, it is not advisable to have large gathering in enclosed spaces. Hece, the GB meeting scheduled to be held on Friday was cancelled,” said Ghodele. No other date for the meeting has been issued so far. 

Incidentally, during the GB meeting on March 4, civic chief Astik Kumar Pandey had raised concerns about the large number of people gathering at one location. There are 115 members of the general body. Apart from them, around 100 employees of the civic body and 50 to 60 news reporters are present in the GB hall during the meeting.tnn
