BHOPAL: The first meeting of special task force formed by the BJP to coordinate with the state government to deal with Covid-19 crisis on Tuesday discussed problems related to farmers, citizens’ role, requirements of doctors and para-medical staff.


Task force convener and BJP state president VD Sharma said that the members interacted through video conference and praised the efforts by the government.

“All members of special task force discussed the role of the government and the organisation during corona pandemic in the state. The members said the central and state governments are working efficiently to deal with the crisis,” said Sharma.

The task force discussed necessary facilities and arrangements for the people in view of the extension of lockdown to May 3. The members raised issues related to procurement of Rabi crops, availability of doctors for general public and problems being faced by the citizens during lockdown.

“There were two main issues that I had raised at the meeting. First, to involve cooperative societies in the procurement whose audit is yet to be done. Second, role and availability of private doctors to deal with cases not related to Covid-19 like pregnancy, injury or any major ailment. I suggested to involve private doctors for treatment in rural and remote areas," former minister and senior MLA, Narottam Mishra told TOI.

Other members including former minister Tulsiram Silawat, organisation general secretary Suhas Bhagat, national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya, former LoP Gopal Bhargava, Lok Sabha member Rakesh Singh, former ministers Rajendra Shukla, Meena Singh and Jagdish Devda also participated in the discussions.
