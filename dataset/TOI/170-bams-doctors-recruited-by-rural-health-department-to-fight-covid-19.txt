Nashik: The district health department has appointed 170 BAMS doctors to screen, diagnose and refer Covid-19 patients to bigger health facilities in the district. They will be stationed at 516 health sub-centres.

Dawal Salve, district health officer, Nashik Zilla Parishad, said that training will be provided online to all these doctors on Monday, following which they will be sent to the respective health sub-centres. 

“The recruitment of doctors to fight Covid-19 was done as per the instructions of the state government,” he said. 

Salve sid that there will now be one doctor for a population of 5,000 people at the village level. “This increased force of doctors would be of great utility to fight the spread of coronavirus. Since there has been a dearth of MBBS doctors, we have recruited BAMS doctors and a few B.Sc Nursing pass-outs,” he said. 

He said that a team each comprising Anganwadi Sevika, Asha workers and ANM (Auxilliary nurse-midwife) have also been stationed for 1,000 people.

The aim of the health department is to maintain a strong vigil to ensure that no individual enters a village from outside. “If at all someone comes, that person is immediately screened for Covid-19 to prevent the virus from spreading at the village level,” said Salve. 

One such patient was recently spotted in Sinnar by the same team. A person from Malegaon came to Sinnar and he was immediately screened for Covid-19. He was found positive despite having no symptoms of the virus. 

This helped in stopping the spread of the virus in Sinnar. These teams are working at all the 1,750 villages spread across the district.

The BAMS doctors will be on contract for 11 months, though their services would be mainly utilised for the fight against Covid-19.
