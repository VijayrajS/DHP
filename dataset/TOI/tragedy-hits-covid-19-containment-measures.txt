Tragedy hits Covid-19 containment measures
2020-05-09
Visakhapatnam: Health officials have gone on an overdrive to trace everyone who were forced to move out of their homes in Gopalapatnam following the styrene gas leak from LG Polymers on Thursday. 

Gopalapatnam is one of the 15 containment zones marked in the city for coronavirus (Covid-19).

Sources in the health department said that Covid-19 source tracing was done prior to the gas leak, but containment measures could not be ensured as residents left soon after the incident. Now, the officials will once again initiate door-to-door survey to know the whereabouts of the people who moved to other locations. 

Speaking on the issue, GVMC commissioner G Srijana said, “People living near the chemical plant are in a state of panic. Many have left the localities and moved in with relatives and friends in other areas. Right now our priority is to make sure that normalcy is restored, before other measures can be taken up.”

District medical and health officer Dr S Tirupathi Rao said, “We have to first make sure that people can return to their homes and only then can we focus on Covid-19 containment measures.”

Meanwhile, sources in the GVMC and district administration said that the officials are focusing on rehabilitation of gas leak survivors and prevention of such accidents. They have decided to resume Covid-19 related measures only after they are able to bring back normalcy in the localities.
