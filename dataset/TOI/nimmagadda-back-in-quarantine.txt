2020-03-20
HYDERABAD: After securing legal relief from Serbian Supreme Court, industrialist Nimmagadda Prasad returned to the city on Wednesday night. However, he was immediately placed under quarantine. 

Prasad is the accused number three in the chargesheet filed by CBI in the Vanpic case which also involves AP chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy. Prasad was the conduit between Ras Al Khaima, an UAE emirate, and the AP government which had agreed to set up the port-cum-industrial corridor Vanpic between Guntur and Prakasam districts. 

Al Khaima had invested more than Rs 500 crore for the purpose in 2008, but the project has been stalled for over a decade on account of the CBI probe. On July 27, Prasad was taken into custody by Serbian authorities at Belgrade when he went there in search of talented players for his football team. Based on the red corner notice issued by interpol on the complaint of Ras Al Khaima government, he was arrested by police of Belgrade in August 2019. 

Later he was released from prison but asked not to leave Belgrade by the authorities there. According to police, recently, a court in Serbia gave an order in favour of Prasad, allowing him to return to India.
