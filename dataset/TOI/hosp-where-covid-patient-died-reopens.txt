2020-04-21
Coimbatore: When front line healthcare professionals were getting infected with Covid-19, the reopening of a city-based private hospital, where a patient died of the virus, has brought cheers among the medical community.

Authorities of Chennai Hospitals on Monday announced that after all 45 staff members of the hospital tested negative for the infection, the district public health department had allowed the hospital to start operations again.

The hospital was closed on April 10 after a patient from Kerala who was admitted there tested positive for the virus and passed away later. The health department immediately quarantined 20 staff, including a doctor, in the hospital and instructed others to remain in home quarantine. 

“All of them took the RT-PCR test on April 13 and 19 and tested negative both times. However, as per norms, the 20 staff will remain under quarantine till April 24. Meanwhile other doctors and staff who were not involved in treatment of the patient will continue to provide clinical services,” said a statement released by the hospital. The hospital premises have been disinfected as per the protocol, it added. 

Meanwhile, other hospitals, which had stopped all elective procedures and asked patients to avoid non-emergency visits, have now begun reassuring people that hospitals are safe to visit. “Thanks to indigenous textile infrastructure in Coimbatore and Tirupur, we could get international standard PPE including hazmat suits, N 95 protective masks etc,” said city-based bariatric surgeon Dr Praveen Palanivel.
