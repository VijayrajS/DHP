Devendra Raut, a passenger, said he somehow managed to board the train at Lokmanya Tilak Terminal in Mumbai along with five more people to return to Patna. “I work as mason at a construction site in Mumbai. We all reached here stuffed inside coaches and lying on one another,” Raut said. “Our contractor gave us Rs 2000 each to travel to Patna,” he added.

Vijendra Kumar Thakur, a daily wager who reached Patna Junction from Pune, said his employer told him to return home in the wake of coronavirus outbreak in Maharashtra. “We were without food for the last four days. Our employers have told us that they will contact us after the situation normalises,” he said.

Hans Lal, a resident of Koili village in Muzaffarpur, said he and three others returned after their family members in Bihar sent them Rs 8,000. He complained that they were not screened by anyone at Danapur railway station.

Amit Kumar, employee of an MNC, who reached Patna Junction from Mumbai in a Guwahati-bound train, said the AC coach in which he was travelling had become a general one with daily wagers also travelling in it.

Shriniwas Mangalam, an UPSC aspirant, said all passengers were taken to a railway school from Danapur for screening.
