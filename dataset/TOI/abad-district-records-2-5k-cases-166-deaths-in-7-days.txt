AHMEDABAD: On Friday, Ahmedabad district recorded 9,724 cumulative Covid-19 positive cases and 645 deaths. In terms of Indian cities, Ahmedabad is on third spot after Mumbai and Delhi and slightly ahead of Chennai.

Analysis of the cases reveal that in the last seven days, the district added 2,553 positive cases and 166 deaths. The death rate for the past week was 6.5%. In the same time, the district also recorded discharge of 1,276 patients. As on Friday, Ahmedabad accounts for 73.3% of total positive cases and 80.4% of total deaths of Gujarat. The silver lining for the district is a decrease in the doubling rate – while it took 15 days for the numbers to double from 4,862, it had only taken nine days to double from 2,496.

“The trend has not changed much in terms of average daily cases or mortality in past seven days. The cases however have spread to diverse areas of the city and district. More contact tracing and intensive identification of new cases are still important to ensure that more persons are identified and quarantined so that when lockdown is eased, we can prevent an exponential rise,” said a city-based infectious diseases expert.

Within the municipal limits, a 21-year-old woman who was nine months pregnant, and who was due on delivering her child in a few days was among the 26 people who died because of Covid-19 on Friday.
