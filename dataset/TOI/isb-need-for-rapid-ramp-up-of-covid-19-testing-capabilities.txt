ISB: Need for rapid ramp-up of Covid-19 testing capabilities
2020-05-21
Hyderabad: The existing rate of onboarding of labs testing Covid-19 samples is not sufficient to meet the testing volume requirement in most of the states and will have to be scaled up rapidly, said a paper authored by faculty and analysts at ISB’s Max Institute of Healthcare Management (MIHM).

 As per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data, there are 391 government and 164 private labs testing Covid-19 samples.

“…Maharashtra, which contributes highest number of cases, would need to add more than 450% of its testing capacity. On the other hand, Haryana, which currently has smaller number of reported cases but extremely limited capacity, will need to add more than 600% capacity. Kerala is one of the few states that may be equipped to handle its projected testing volume with current capacity as its reported cases have been demonstrating a decreasing trend,” the paper titled `Testing capacity for Covid-19 – How ready are we for the battle?’ --- co-authored by Sarang Deo, executive director, MIHM, along with analysts Aman Kabra and Hemanshu Das, said.

The paper pointed out that it may not be possible to ramp up capacity to a level where each state is self-sufficient. Therefore, in some cases adding capacity to existing labs may be a faster and more economical way.

 It also rooted for leveraging other parts of the health system to accelerate the pace of testing. 

For instance, tests for HIV and TB are conducted on machines such as Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test, which have the same underlying technology required for Covid-19 testing. The only major tweak required is the shift to Covid-19 specific testing reagents and cartridges, it said.
