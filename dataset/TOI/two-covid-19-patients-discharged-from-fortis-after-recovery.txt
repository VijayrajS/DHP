Gurgaon: Two Covid-19 patients who were treated successfully were discharged on Sunday from Fortis Memorial, Gurgaon. Doctors at the hospital explained the line of treatment and highlighted how they modified certain processes to deal with the critical situation.

The two patients who have recovered are siblings from Palam Vihar. The sister, a 22-year-old student of London university, tested positive on March 18 and was admitted to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and later shifted to Fortis. Her 16-year-old brother had also tested positive and was admitted to same private hospital on March 21.

The hospital said both had fever and cough when they were brought in and were treated in the isolation ward as per their symptoms. They responded well to the treatment, and since their Covid test results were negative for two consecutive days and chest X-rays were normal, they were discharged on Sunday.

Dr Manoj Goel (55), director, pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, who is treating Covid-19 patients said, “The treatment essentially is symptomatic in the majority of the patients aimed at relieving fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In mild cases, this might simply mean rest and fever-reducing medications such as paracetamol. Oxygen therapy is the intervention for patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary when oxygen therapy isn’t successful. Support for other failing organs such as dialysis may also be required.”

He shared that the process of preparing the staff to fight the pandemic and treat patients, was time-consuming.“When doctors are in the isolation ward, they can’t use washroom or can’t have water for more than six hours,” he added.

“I have a wife and son (19) at home. We try to ensure that we are at least two metres away from each other in case we need to talk while we are at home,” he added.
