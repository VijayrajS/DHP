China experts claim new drug has potential to treat Covid-19
2020-05-20
BEIJING: A Chinese laboratory has been developing a drug it believes has the power to bring the pandemic to a halt. The drug being tested by scientists at China’s Peking University could not only shorten the recovery time for those infected, but even offer short-term immunity from the virus, researchers say.



Sunney Xie, director of the university’s Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, said that the drug has been successful at the animal testing stage. “When we injected neutralising antibodies into infected mice, after five days the viral load was reduced by a factor of 2,500,” said Xie. “That means this potential drug has

(a) therapeutic effect.” The drug uses neutralising antibodies — produced by the human immune system to prevent the virus infecting cells — which Xie’s team isolated from the blood of 60 recovered patients.

A study on the team’s research, published on Sunday in the scientific journal Cell, suggests that using the antibodies provides a potential “cure” for the disease. Xie said he hopes that the drug will be ready for use later this year. “Planning for the clinical trial is under way,” he said, adding it will be carried out in Australia and other countries since cases have dwindled in China, offering fewer people for testing.
