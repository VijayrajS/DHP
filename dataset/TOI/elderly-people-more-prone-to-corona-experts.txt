PATNA: Elderly people with underlying health factors such as hypertension and diabetes are more vulnerable to new coronavirus (Covid-19), say experts. Even the two deaths in India due to coronavirus are of elderly people. 

Medical journal Lancet in its report found that average age of those who died of coronavirus was 69 years. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital deaths and 191 patients from two hospitals were analysed. These patients were infected with coronavirus. As per the report, 137 people were discharged by January 31, while the 54 who died had an average age of 69 years.

The finding stated that of the total patients infected with coronavirus and studied, 48% had comorbidity, that is more than one health problem along with primary problem.

Again, hypertension and diabetic patients were more prone to this virus. While 30% of the patients studied had hypertension, 36% were diabetic, 8% suffered from coronary heart disease, 3% from chronic obstructive lung disease, 1% with chronic kidney disease and 12% from other problems.

Hence, health experts advise elderly people to remain cautious. “Those who have diabetes, heart or kidney problem or are suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) need to be more cautious as these people have week immunity,” said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi.

Talking about risk factors in children, former head of PMCH paediatric department, Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, said children below 18 years were likely to be least affected. Citing WHO’s findings, he said, “Only 2% of children below 18 have been affected and out of them only 3% suffered serious diseases like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock.”
