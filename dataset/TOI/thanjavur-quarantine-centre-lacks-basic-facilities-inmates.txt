Thanjavur: The inmates of a quarantine facility set up at a newly constructed building in Vallam in Thanjavur district alleged that it lacked even basic amenities. The facility is among the several facilities in the district to quarantine people arriving from different parts of the state and from outside the state. The inmates of the facility blamed the officials for sending them there without ensuring that the building had proper facilities in place. One of the inmates who arrived at the facility on June 8, alleged that when he was brought to the building the rooms didn’t even have beds and mattresses. There were no buckets or mugs in the toilets and there was no proper lighting facility in the rooms, he alleged.“It is a newly constructed building and was not ready for use when we arrived here. It was the inmates who swept and cleaned the floor. Rooms and halls were full of dust. Since there is no boundary wall for the building there is no security for the people staying here. There is also a honeycomb in the building and we fear being attacked by the bees”, said one of the inmates on condition of anonymity. When contacted, the district collector M Govinda Rao told TOI that it was a newly constructed tenement and that he has directed officials to provide the things necessary. “I visited the facility and now it has the required basic amenities”, he added.
