Goa: Over Rs 3 crore PF payout under special Covid-19 provision
2020-04-17
PANAJI: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) has settled nearly 3,000 claims, disbursing Rs 9.69 crore to EPF members who filed claims online, said regional provident fund commissioner Ashwini Kumar Gupta. The disbursed funds include Rs 3.65 crore that EPF members applied for under the newly introduced Covid-19 provision.

Gupta said that the regional office in Goa was doing its best to settle claims during the lockdown period and highlighted that the department was working with minimum staff due to the corona virus pandemic.

In view of the lockdown curbs, EPFO-Goa has granted a 30-day grace period and extended the due date for filing electronic challan cum return (ECR) for the period from March to May 15 for employers who have paid wages to their employees.

The employers disbursing the wages for March not only get relief of extension of the due date for payment of EPF dues but also avoid liability of interest and penalty, if they deposit the funds by May 15, said Gupta. This move, he said, was to incentivize employers to pay workers their wages and salaries during the lockdown. “Pension for March was disbursed on March 30 to 19,467 EPS pensioners in the Goa,” said Gupta.
