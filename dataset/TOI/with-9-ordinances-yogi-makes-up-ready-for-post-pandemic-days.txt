With 9 ordinances, Yogi makes UP ready for post-pandemic days
2020-05-23
LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath flying to Gorakhpur for his temple abode on Friday after a gap of over two and a half months days in the midst of the Covid-19 battle, is a clear indication that the situation is gradually improving in the state.

Officially, the CM had gone to inspect the demolition of a wall of Gorakhnath Peeth – where he has been staying for over 25 years – to pave way for the construction of four-lane road. But his absence from the state capital also highlights his confidence in the Team 11 and corroborates the fact that his trusted officers are doing their job much to his satisfaction.

To fortify UP against the novel coronavirus pandemic and to minimise the death rate, the CM took a series of decisions. From having only one lab and doing just 200 tests per day in March to having 27 labs and conducting 30,000 tests daily the state has come a long way under leadership of Yogi Adityanath. He along with his Team 11 is fully succeeded in creating a decent medical infrastructure in just 45 days.

Within the same span, the UP government passed nine ordinance not only to protect corona warriors but also make the state industry friendly. Historic labour and farm reforms were also set in motion in the same period. If top officers of the state remained on toes to implement his planning and strategy in the Covid fight, the CM also set an example of following the 'raj dharma' by not attending the last rites of his father who had died during the lockdown. 

As soon as the CM realised that the average Covid mortality rate is much less in the state as compared to other states, he included the agenda of economic revival in his war against the virus. Now his teams are busy in attracting industries from across the globe to rise to PM Modi's words -- Jaan Bhi, Jahan Bhi.
