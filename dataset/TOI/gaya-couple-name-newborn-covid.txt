Bihar: Gaya couple names newborn ‘Covid’
2020-04-08
GAYA: A baby born amid lockdown at the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH) has been named ‘Covid’ by his parents.


Despite the grim association of the name with the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world, the young couple is happy with the name of their son, who was born on Saturday. “The name of the child will always be a reminder for us of the joy he brought by being born in such stressful circumstances,” said Covid’s mother 25-year-old Priyanjali.

A family member, however, said the child’s father, Manish Kumar, was initially reluctant, but came around to the idea after the baby’s Mama (maternal uncle) convinced him. They are residents of Badgaon village of Tekari block in the district.

The gynaecologist attached with the ANMMCH delivered Covid through caesarean section after normal birth was ruled out. “The baby is healthy and doing fine,” hospital sources said. ANMMCH has been notified as a dedicated hospital for Covid-19 patients of seven districts of south Bihar, including all five districts of Magadh division.

Covid’s parents may have been inspired by former CM and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, who had named his first child ‘MISA’ (Maintenance of Internal Security Act), the draconian law that kept Lalu and many others in jail during Emergency.

“That Covid’s mother could reach the hospital during stringent lockdown and delivered a healthy baby was, itself a big achievement. The parents should have named the baby as Covid 20,” said Dr Ram Sewak, president of the Gaya chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).
