2020-06-04
Trichy: Culinary experts and their workers, who prepare feasts for functions including weddings, in Trichy, have been waiting for normalcy to return as they have had no income for the past two and a half months due to the lockdown to curb Covid-19.

A Ghouse Mohammed, a chef from Inamkulathur in Trichy, said that around 15 orders were cancelled during the lockdown as the government denied permission to conduct functions in marriage halls with more than 30 people. The cap on the number of people was increased to 50 on May 31.

“Since there were many restrictions in place, people had no other option than reducing the food to only fora maximum 50 people,” said Mohammed.

A chef with at least 60 of his workers could manage the food preparation for 1,000 people for two days. They would charge around Rs 50,000 as their charge. Just 50 people does not give much returns.

A vegetarian culinary expert, S Ramesh Kumar, expressed his anguish over the suffering of the helpers attached to him and other senior chefs.

“It is bit unusual in Tamil culture to conduct auspicious functions without feast. That, too, happened now. While it affected the people a lot, the pandemic left the chefs and workers penniless as we had no orders in two and half months,” said Kumar.

Kumar went on to explain in detail about the ordeal being faced by the workers in the catering business. “One can see people waiting on the platform of Cauvery Bridge, Amma Mandapam and near Rajagopuram of Srirangam temple for food served by donors every day. Most of them in the group are jobless workers with the chefs,” said Kumar.

The chefs lamented that some of the functions were even postponed due to the lockdown. “We had a booking for today but it was postponed,” a chef R Manikandan in Lalgudi in Trichy.

They also expect the state government to consider their plight and provide them with financial assistance.
