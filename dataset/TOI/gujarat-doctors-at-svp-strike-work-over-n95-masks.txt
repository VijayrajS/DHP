Ahmedabad: Doctors at SVP strike work over N95 masks
2020-05-13
AHMEDABAD: In a glaring instance of apathy towards safety needs of frontline warriors against Covid-19, close to a 100 resident doctors and paramedic staff at SVP hospital at Ellisbridge went on flash strike complaining they were not issued N95 respirators (masks) and PPE equipment—basic safety gear required by medicos in the Covid-19 frontline.

“Hospital authorities are asking us to wear two-three ordinary masks and go into Covid wards or buy N-95 masks from out pockets. This is shocking and unacceptable,” said a striking doctor.

Left red-faced, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, that has been making tall claims to have sufficient stocks of safety gear for medical and para-medical staff swung into action and ordered 2,000 N95 respirators from Vadodara and few neighbouring district health centres to be provided to doctors at SVP. The doctors and paramedic staff had also demanded that problems related to their duty shifts and issues of access to food should be resolved. SVP hospital on the other hand issued a statement which said, “There is no shortage of any kind of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at SVP. All staff members have been issued proper number of PPE kits as per guidelines. In the photo shared by doctors you can see some of them wearing N95 masks.”
