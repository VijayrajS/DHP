HYDERABAD: Two days after a 24-year software professional was confirmed as the first case of Covid-19 in Hyderabad, two more suspected cases tested positive in the first round of testing at the ICMR laboratory at Gandhi Medical College in Secunderabad. The samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for final confirmation.


State health authorities also said that the first Covid-19 positive patient is stable even as 39 more people with initial symptoms were isolated at Gandhi Hospital and Fever Hospital on Wednesday. Another 55 people, who approached authorities for tests, were advised to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days.

The two new cases whose samples have been sent to NIV include a software professional working at Raheja Mindspace in the IT hub and had visited Italy recently. The other is a sanitation worker at Apollo Hospitals at Secunderabad where the first positive patient had been treated initially

“The NIV report is expected on Thursday,” said the Dr G Srinivas Rao, Telangana director public health. “The two patients are being kept in isolation at Gandhi Hospital. 45 others who tested negative were discharged and advised strict home isolation for 14 days.” On Wednesday, health minister Eatela Rajender asked IT professionals and others not to panic.
