Medical college dean, doctors among 100 quarantined
2020-03-28
Ahmedabad: Over 100 people, including the dean, doctors, and health staff of a medical college and hospital — run by the Gujarat Medical and Education Research Society (GMERS) — have been quarantined after the dean’s wife tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Friday.

The woman, 55, had tested positive on Thursday, they said. The medical college and hospital is run by the state government. “The dean’s wife works as a pathologist at some other hospital and may have got infected during her work,” deputy commissioner of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Om Prakash said. “There are two other possibilities. On March 15, some of her relatives from Mumbai had visited the family,” he said. “That could have led to the infection. We also learnt that her daughter-in-law had returned from Singapore and Thailand last month.”

She was hospitalised after her test reports confirmed her infection, Prakash added. However, her husband is healthy and has not shown any specific symptoms of coronavirus infection so far. “As a precautionary measure, we have also quarantined over 100 people, who had come in contact with the couple, including their relatives, doctors, and members of the college staff,” Prakash said.
