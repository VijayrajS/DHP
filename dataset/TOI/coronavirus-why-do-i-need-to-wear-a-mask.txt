Coronavirus: Why do I need to wear a mask?
2020-04-06
Mask-wearing has emerged as one of the important measures to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Protective masks are said to lower the chances of coronavirus entering our respiratory system through droplets that are present in the air. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas.

"It is suggested that people who are not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step out of their house. This will help in protecting the community at large," the ministry of health and family welfare said in its advisory.

Reducing the chances of inhaling the virus by wearing a protective mask that is cleaned thoroughly using a combination of approaches that use heat, UV light, water, soap and alcohol, will be vital to stopping its spread. 

Experts have also said that India will benefit from use of masks. “Widespread use of masks could be the next step for India, combined with awareness on vigorous hand hygiene and hand sanitisers,” they said.

It is critical to emphasize that aside from wearing masks, maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.
