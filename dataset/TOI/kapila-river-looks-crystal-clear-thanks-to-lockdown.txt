Kapila river looks crystal clear, thanks to lockdown
2020-04-25
Mysuru: No foam, no foul smell and no floating clothes. The water is so clear that you can see the bottom of the river. This is how Kapila, the lifeline of Nanjangud, has regained its glory. 

No devotee is taking bath or dumping waste. The pollution has eased since no industry is functioning. Thanks to lockdown, the river that flows across the temple town has managed to improve its health. 

According to Yuva Brigade district convenor S Chandrashekar, who is in the forefront of cleaning the river, its water quality has improved a lot. “It is very clear now,” he said. 

“In Nanjangud, over 140 industrial units are functioning. All these days, the river was forced to bear the brunt of these industries. Adding to this, now no devotee is visiting the temple. So the quality of river water has improved a lot. The water is flowing pleasantly,” he said.

According to Chandrashekar, in the holy bath area, reeds have come up. “But in the entire stretch, the quality of water is very pure,” he said.

According to local residents, the lockdown has come as a huge blessing to this river which is considered as one of the holy rivers. “All these days, it was the Kapila river which was paying the price for everying—for industrial activities to holy bath of devotees. Now, except the release of drainage water in a few places, the water quality has reached its peak. No one has seen such a high quality water in recent decades,” said Sudhami, a local teacher.

Suraj R, another resident, said changes in the environment shall be taken seriously by the locals. “All these days, a majority of the locals have never cared for the health of this river. They were exploiting it. Now nature has shown a way. It is our responsibility to keep the river clean,” he said.
