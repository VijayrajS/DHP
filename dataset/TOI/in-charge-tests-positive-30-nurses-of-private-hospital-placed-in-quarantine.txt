PUNE: Thirty nurses working with a private hospital in Pune were quarantined after the incharge-nurse tested positive for the Covid-19 on Saturday night. 


The nurse had returned to work two days ago after a week's casual leave. She is a resident of Kasarwadi. Her family members and other close contacts are also being traced and quarantined.

This is the second case in Pune wherein a health worker was found infected with the contagion. A junior doctor at private hospital in Rasta Peth had also tested positive for Covid-19 a week ago. Both had no history of recent foreign travel or any proximity to known infected persons or their close contacts.

"Our in-charge nurse had a mild cold and cough, hence we tested her as a precautionary measure. Her throat swab tested positive for Covid-19. We have put 30 nurses, who she had come in contact with, under observation at our nursing hostel," the hospital's medical director said. 

Her work profile is more of administrative work. She is not involved in patient-care. Her main job is to oversee work of other nurses. She ensures duties,leaves and shifts of other nurses working under her. Again, she is with general ward of the hospital and not involved in the isolation ward where we treat Covid-19 positive patients, he added.

The hospital authorities also tested six other patients she had briefly come in contact with. "All tested negative . We will also test our quarantined nurses," he said.

The nurse is currently being treated at the hospital's isolation ward. "She only had mild symptoms. She is on full diet and recovering," he said.

The medical director said they we keeping an eye on every staff who has flu-like symptoms.
