Vijayawada: Virus fears keep customers away from eateries
2020-05-27
VIJAYAWADA: Even as restaurants in Vijayawada restart takeaway and home deliveries after a brief hiatus on account of the lockdown, the beginnings have been rocky owing to customers’ fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus. Fear of virus spread is making many reluctant to ordering food from restaurants.


Sanjay Jain, secretary of Vijayawada Hotel Owners’ Association said, “People are apprehensive about the quality of food at hotels. As a result, people are sticking to homemade food. But restaurants and eateries are following guidelines. Reluctance of consumers to order food is really hurting business.”

Most hotels and restaurants are running takeaway services and are strictly maintaining hygiene in kitchens, Sanjay said adding that only healthy employees are being put to work and packaging is done without contact as much as possible.

K Brahmiah, a food delivery executive, said, “Before the lockdown, I used to deliver at least 40 orders per day. Now, my orders have come down to 12 on average.”
