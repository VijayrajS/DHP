15-member panel to facilitate burials in Covid-19 death cases
2020-04-20
LUCKNOW: The Islamic Centre of India on Sunday formed a 15-member ‘Qabristan Sewa Samiti’ (Committee to help in burials) to facilitate last rites of persons dying of Covid-19 in Lucknow district, both as per the health department protocol and in the Islamic light.

Till date, the city has reported one death due to the coronavirus infection and that is of a 64-year-old patient who died here on Wednesday.

The 15-member committee comprises private doctors, clerics and social workers. When the committee members would be contacted by a family seeking burial of someone who has died of Covid-19 they would extend full help to them by facilitating the burial without any untoward incident. The burial will be done as per WHO protocols.

Head of the Islamic Centre of India and Imam of the Aishbagh Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali said that the need for formation of such a committee arose after locals did not allow burial of an elderly patient in the public graveyard of Aishbagh. This, he said, was due to misconceptions about performing last rites of a person died of Covid-19 though there were definitive guidelines for the same.

“The Aishbagh incident is highly condemnable. After it a fatwa was issued by Darul Uloom Farangi Mahal based Darul Ifta for the burial of Muslims, who have died of Covid-19, as per Islamic and WHO protocols. Following the 'fatwa', we started receiving hundreds of phone calls from people who were not clear about the proper method for last rites in such cases,” Maulana Khalid Rasheed said. It was then that the cleric formed the committee and also requested clerics in other districts to come up with the same.

Panel convener is Maulana Mohammad Mushtaq who can be contacted on 9415102947. Haji Mohammad Kaleem Khan is the co-convener: 6392207341 and 9648442910.
