MOTIHARI: Around 36 doctors boycotted work for a few hours at Motihari sadar hospital on Saturday to protest non-availability of N95 masks. The doctors alleged that the health department has so far not provided them face and nose masks.

Dr Anil Sinha, one of the doctors at the OPD, said N95 masks and alcohol-based sanitizers were not provided to doctors. “There is no restroom for doctors and other health staff as well at the hospital,” Dr Sinha added.

Dr Suresh Prasad Singh said it is extremely unsafe for doctors to work without masks. “Any suspected patient can come to OPD and the attending doctor might come in contact with the patient,” he said.

East Champaran civil surgeon Dr Rizwan Ahmad reached the hospital in the afternoon and persuaded the protesting doctors to resume duty after wearing general masks.

Dr Ahmad said around 3,000 surgical masks were made available in the district by the health department, but there was shortage of N95 masks. “N95 masks will be made available at all government hospitals in the district soon. These masks will be used by doctors whenever necessary,” he said.

There is also an acute shortage of general masks and alcohol-based sanitizers in East Champaran district, which is located along the India-Nepal border. General mask is being sold at Rs 50 per piece. According to sources, since there is an acute shortage of masks in Nepal as well, they are being smuggled to the neighbouring country from north Bihar.
