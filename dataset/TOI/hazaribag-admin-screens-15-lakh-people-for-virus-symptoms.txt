Hazaribag: The Hazaribag administration on Friday said it has screened over 15 lakh people across six blocks of the district for symptoms of Covid-19. 

Deputy commissioner Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh said 15 lakh people were screened across Barhi, Barkattha, Chouparan, Padma, Chalkusha and Sadar blocks. “Among them, around 9,850 had returned from various parts of the country,” Singh said. In all, over two lakh households were screened. 

The DC further said screening of the remaining population of the district will start from Saturday. Hazaribag has an estimated population of over 20 lakh across 16 blocks. 

Meanwhile, Hazaribag civil surgeon Dr Krishna Kumar allegedly misbehaved with journalists when he was asked to comment on whether the Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital has received its consignment of ventilators from ICMR. “The media of Hazaribag has developed a habit of disturbing us,” he said and refused to talk further.
