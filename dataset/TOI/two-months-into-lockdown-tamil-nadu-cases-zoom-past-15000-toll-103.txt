2020-05-24
CHENNAI: With one day to go for the state to complete two months of lockdown, Tamil Nadu on Saturday breached the 15,000-mark to record 15,512 Covid-19 cases. Chennai swas 11 cases short of 10,000. Five more deaths, all in Chennai, took the state toll to 103.


While the state recorded 759 new cases, Chennai recorded one of its highest single-day increases of 624 cases, taking its tally to 9,989. The spillover continued in adjoining districts — Chengalpet logged 39 cases, Tiruvallur had 17 and Kancheepuram reported 13. Seven people who returned from London and five from Philippines tested positive, besides 37 others from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The remaining 17 cases were in other districts. In the Covid-19 control room, health experts and officials said were preparing for a likely surge in Covid-19 count in the coming days. “We are preparing for the worstcase scenario that has predicted over lakh cases of hospitalisation. We don’t know if we will see that many cases. But we want to be prepared,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh.

All government hospitals, health secretary Beela Rajesh said, will be able to offer elective surgeries and other services without hindrance when the lockdown is relaxed. “We too will learn to treat with Covid,” she said.

It took nearly two months for the state to get to the first 5,000 cases, but in the next 16 days it added 10,000 cases. In May, the state recorded 13,313 cases and 76 deaths. Yet, it managed to bring down the mortality rate drastically. “That’s the silver lining. We have mortality of around 0.6% and it’s the lowest in the country. Our recovery rate is climbing to nearly 50% now. On Sunday, our team proudly shared our treatment protocol with several states on directions from the Centre,” she said.

The state has been able to detect cases quickly, bring them to hospitals when they are still presymptomatic, bring comorbidities under control while they are treated. Before sending patients for home isolation, doctors ensure a battery of tests is conducted though they are asymptomatic, says Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital dean Dr R Jayanthi. The state’s tertiary hospital has treated more than 2,200 patients —more than 600 had comorbidities where the mortality rate is 1.5%. “We have helped patients with dual transplants, cancer and renal failure recover because of intense monitoring,” she said. Most hospitals have made minimum use of ventilators and, instead, used high flow oxygen and prone nursing (asking people to sleep on their stomach to increase oxygen levels).

Nearly 85% of the 103 deaths occurred within the first week of hospitalisation. “ Most patients had advanced stages of chronic ailments, uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension. Many of them were critical and did not live for more than an hour,” said a senior doctor. While 35 patients died with one day, 25 more died within the next 48 hours. Of the 103 patients, 87 of them died within a week. The mortality was also high among the elderly.
