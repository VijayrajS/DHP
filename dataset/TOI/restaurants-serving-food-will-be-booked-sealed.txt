2020-03-21
NEW DELHI: Restaurants and eateries serving food to the customers in their dining spaces will face an FIR as well as sealing of establishment. A day after Delhi government placed restrictions on the services at the restaurants amid the coronavirus outbreak, public health inspectors have started issuing notices to them in this regard. Municipal corporations have been tasked with the implementation of the restrictions.


A senior district health official said a list of all the restaurants and eateries in the south Delhi areas has been prepared. The public health inspectors are individually visiting them and making their owners and managers aware of the curbs in place. Action will be taken against those flouting the norms, he added.

Meanwhile, several restaurants in Delhi have already downed their shutters. A few are open only to deliver food on orders.

A senior public health official of SDMC said that not only restaurants, but also guesthouses and banquet halls will be checked to ensure that more than 20 people do not gather in a confined space. “If people are planning to organise even a small gathering, they should be expecting a visit from the health inspectors. We will verify if 1sqm norm is being followed or not. We strongly advise people not to organise any gathering in the time of corona,” he added.

The official added that there are around 2,500 lodging houses and 5,000 restaurants in the city.

Special vigilance is being undertaken in SDMC’s west zone which has areas like Janakpuri and Uttam Nagar. Multiple coronavirus cases have been confirmed in these areas and even a death has been reported, added the official. The zone hosts more than 500 restaurants of which 70 establishments have seating capacity of more than 50 people.
