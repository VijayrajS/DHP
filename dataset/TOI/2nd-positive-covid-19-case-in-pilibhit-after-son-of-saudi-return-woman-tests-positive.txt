PILIBHIT: Three days after a 73-year-old woman in UP’s Pilibhit had been found to be infected with novel coronavirus (Covid-19), her 33-year-old son has now tested positive on Wednesday. The man’s mother had returned from Saudi Arabia on March 19 after completing a 20-day stay.


The elderly woman was accompanied by 36 other pilgrims of Pilibhit who have been kept under quarantine for at least 28 days. The man’s report was released by King George’s Medical University (KGMU). It confirmed the city’s second case on Tuesday night.

The Covid-19 infection was believed to have been transmitted to the man from his mother as he had stayed with her in isolation ward despite not showing any preliminary symptoms of the virus.

“We tried our best to keep the man in quarantine at old district government hospital along with his father, elder brother’s wife and 36 other pilgrims. But, he persisted to stay with his mother,” said Dr CM Chaturvedi, the additional chief medical officer.

However, there was some good news as the test reports of his two family members along with auxiliary nurse midwifery (ANM), who was a tenant of the elderly woman, was found negative, Chaturvedi said, adding that testing of 36 others is not needed at the moment as they have not shown any symptoms.

Notably, the 73-year-old woman was found with cough and sore throat on March 21, and the health department had sent her blood samples for testing to KGMU. The brother in-law of 33-year-old man said, “I accept the foolishness of my wife’s brother in persisting to stay with his mother but he could have been saved had the health officials persuaded and quarantined him at some other place.”
