With three meals a day, homeless enjoy life under Covid lockdown
2020-04-06
Trichy: The lockdown has come as a blessing for the homeless people in the city as it has made their lives temporarily better as they are getting food almost three times a day from good Samaritans while people are enquiring on their well-being, something that was rare prior to the lockdown.

R Sundar, 55, who lives on the streets in Cantonment, said he is content on getting quality food three times a day. “A lot of people are approaching us during the lockdown, politely enquiring whether we need food. We feel happy that some people are caring for us,” Sundar said. 

Multiple NGOs and individuals have been feeding at least 500-600 homeless people in the city daily since the lockdown began. Volunteers said homeless people daily return to the same spot where they were given food. “So many groups are now providing food. If the homeless have already been provided with food, we give them water bottles and snacks,” said Arudra Saravanakumar, a volunteer. 

Organisations involved in providing food to the homeless said the anticipation of homeless people every day keeps them going. Financial support is flowing in from various parts of the state, mostly from the natives in the city. “Strangers approach us and ask whether we had food. Such care was never shown before the lockdown,” said R Ravichandran, a 60-year-old homeless man in Puthur. 

While the homeless persons are worried what happens after the lockdown is over, voluntary organisations said that they have planned to form locality-wise groups to feed the homeless by mobilising excess food from party halls and major events. 

“We will continue the service even after the lockdown is lifted. A financial model to feed the homeless in city with decent food every day will be worked out,” said G V Karthik, a Woraiyur based volunteer.
