Docs find link between Covid-19, gastrointestinal trouble in Hyd

Hyderabad: Several Covid-19 patients treated at the Gandhi Hospital (the nodal centre for treating covid-19 positive patients) showed stomach ache and diarrhoea as symptoms. While studies on patients in China have established a clear link between Covid-19 and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, a similar trend has also been observed in patients here, say doctors.

As part of a study conducted in Wuhan (China), it was found that 16 per cent of the Covid-19 patients, showed GI symptoms. Among them the common symptoms were nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and diarrhoea.

“While we are seeing some patients with abdominal pain and diarrhoea, these patients are less in number when compared to patients with upper respiratory and renal symptoms. At the moment it is difficult to make an estimation of the percentage of patients with GI symptoms,” said Dr Narasimha Rao Netha, deputy superintendent, Gandhi Hospital.

Speaking about the need for being on the lookout for such symptoms, Dr P Vinay Kumar, surgical gastroenterologist said, “We need to probably look at correlation between GI symptoms and Covid-19 and investigate patients for coronavirus based on these. Doctors need to be on the lookout especially in case of patients with diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. We are seeing some cases with GI symptoms in the city, including some vague symptoms like a gall bladder patient turning out to be Covid-19 positive.” 

. “What is unnerving about the infection is that, its effects are not limited to the respiratory system only. Other organs such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver seem to be targeted by the virus as well,” pointed out Dr Dinesh Kini, gastroenterologist and hepatologist.
