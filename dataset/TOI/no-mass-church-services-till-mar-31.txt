Written instructions from Archbishop Thomas D’Souza for Roman Catholic Church and Bishop Paritosh Canning for the CNI have reached parish priests of all member churches on Friday. Meetings, seminars, choir practices and retreats have also been cancelled.

According to the letter of archbishop D’Souza, all major celebrations like Sunday mass, Way of the Cross or Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in all parish churches, will remain suspended to avoid public gatherings. Archbishop D’Souza will conduct Sunday mass from the Archbishop House and this will be webcast at real time. “We have decided on the webcast so that even if we are not able to make it to church, we don’t lose direction,” said vicar general Dominic Gomes. Bishop Canning’s letter says all corporate worship on Sundays and Lenten Devotions on Wednesdays and Fridays stand suspended.
