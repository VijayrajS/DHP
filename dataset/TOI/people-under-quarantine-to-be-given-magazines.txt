DEHARDUN: The district administration has decided to provide people at quarantine facilities with weekly and monthly magazines for their entertainment. The decision by Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava comes after several people, who were put under quarantine after their return to the state, suggested such a move. Notably, DM Srivastava has been taking feedback from the people at quarantine centres on a daily basis.

On Friday, the district magistrate inspected several quarantine centres, including Agrasen Hotel, Hotel Garhwal Terrace in Mussoorie, GMD Hotel, and Guru Ram Rai Public School, and took feedback from people quarantined at these facilities.

“We are immediately resolving any difficulty faced by people at quarantine centers. I have also asked other officials to take feedback from these people and ensure their convenience. In addition, we are also providing them with necessary supplies, including toothbrush, paste, soap, and handwash, among others. Besides, nutritious diet is being ensured to people, especially children, at these quarantine centers,” said DM Srivastava.
