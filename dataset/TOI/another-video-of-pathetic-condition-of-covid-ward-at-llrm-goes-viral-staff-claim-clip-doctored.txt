2020-06-14
Meerut: Yet another set of series of videos depicting unhygienic conditions at the Covid ward of the Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College have come to the fore.

A man, claiming to be a coronavirus positive patient and undergoing treatment at the LLRM hospital, made the video viral. In the clip, the patients claimed that they are not even being allowed to take their phones inside the ward.

The video then purportedly showed dirty linen lying on the floor with human faeces, as is being claimed by one of the patients. Afterwards in the video, another man was seen making allegations that a patient had died earlier “for want of oxygen mask.”

Responding to the videos, the LLRM authorities termed the clip “doctored”.

“We have not admitted any youth by the name he introduced himself in the video. This is being circulated just to malign the name of the institution." said principal of LLRM Dr SK Garg. 

This comes days after a video had gone viral showing a similar situation. Such repeated revelations led to the transfer of previous principal.

Interestingly, the UP government had to retract its earlier order of prohibiting phones inside the quarantine wards after its decision drew flak.
