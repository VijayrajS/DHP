Kerala government to begin Covid-19 testing with results in 45 minutes
2020-04-27
KOCHI: The government is soon starting Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 test, the fastest diagnostic tests available in the state, at Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode medical colleges. While the existing RT-PCR testing facilities in the state take at least four hours to get results, Xpert-Sars-Cov2 test can yield results within 45 minutes.

According to experts, the Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 test, is more accurate and the fastest available in the state. “It is a nucleic acid test (NAT) which can deliver results in 45 minutes. It is a sophisticated machine, but the cost for testing is high,” a scientist with Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology (SCTIMST) said. “Maybe the high cost for testing is the factor which stops the government from using the test in a widespread manner,” he said.

Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has allotted cartridges required for conducting Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 tests for three medical colleges in the state. In an order issued on Friday, the state government has given strict instructions to the medical college authorities that only emergency cases should be tested using the method. 

As per government order, some of the specific emergency cases where Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 test should be used are: if a healthcare worker with possibility of high exposure to Covid-19, patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) for whom an early test result will have a role in clinical management and any Covid-suspected death which requires tests for further actions. Only nasopharyngeal swabs should be used for testing. Swabs should be placed in a 3 ml viral transport medium and stored as per WHO standards.

The machines, the same as ones used for TB diagnostic tests, are required for Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 test and are already available with the medical colleges. Government provided the sophisticated machine costing Rs 40 lakh at Government medical college, Ernakulam, in 2019 for TB diagnostic tests. 

“We should use the cartridges of Covid-19 instead of TB cartridges. The results can be yielded within 45 minutes. At the RT-PCR facility, we require around four hours, including sample collection and processing time, to generate results. We started Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 tests from Sunday,” an official with the medical college said.

“We have 360 cartridges but we can conduct tests of only four samples at a time. A maximum of 20 Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 tests can conducted in a day,” the official added. 

According to officials with Thiruvananthapuram medical college, they will start Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 test from Monday. It is learnt that the government is planning to give Xpert-Sars-Cov-2 test cartridges to hospitals like regional cancer centre (RCC) where patients are awaiting urgent surgeries.
