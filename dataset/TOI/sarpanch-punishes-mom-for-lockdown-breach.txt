Telangana: Woman breaks lockdown, sarpanch-son ‘banishes’ her
2020-04-16
HYDERABAD: Many villages in the state are strictly following the lockdown norms and are not allowing outsiders to come in. They are not even allowing their own folks to return to the village from other places. So strictly the norms are being followed that a sarpanch of a village in Sangareddy did not permit even his mother to come back home. 


Sai Goud, sarpanch of Goisaipally of Sirgapoor mandal, had to take such a decision when his mother Tulsamma, who had returned from his relative’s house, was made to wait at the entry point. The sarpanch came there and told his mother that the rules would be applicable for her too and that she would not be allowed into the village. He asked her to go back to the relative’s house. A disappointed Tulsamma turned back. This incident reportedly happened on April 13.

Many sarpanches are physically present at the entry points to ensure that outsiders are not allowed. In Nalgonda district, 23-year-old Vudutha Akhila Yadav, sarpanch of Madanapuram village, stands at the entry points, sometimes even armed with a stick, to ensure that the lockdown is not violated. No outsiders enter the village, even with the intention of passing through it.

“Do not come to our village. We will not come to your village,” reads a banner at Tanikella village in Konijerla mandal in Khammam. Chopped tree branches have been used to barricade the village. In Bhimunigudem village of Bhadrachalam, sarpanch Madakam Pothamma too is at the forefront of guarding the village. 

The villagers themselves are taking turns to stay on guard at such barricades even throughout the night. Only during medical emergencies, they are opening the entries. Otherwise, no one is being allowed to enter or exit. Even those from Hyderabad, who had returned home after the lockdown had been announced, were not allowed to enter the villlages.
