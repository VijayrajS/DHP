Lucknow: The number of Covid-19 cases in the city crossed the 300-mark on Sunday, with four more corona warriors — all health workers, including a female doctor and two women staff nurses, testing positive for novel coronavirus among the nine new cases that pushed the city tally to 305.

The three corona warriors, a female doctor and two female nurses who were part of a 25-member team from Hardoi, got infected during duty at Ram Sagar Mishra Hospital, taking the number of medical personnel diagnosed with Covid-19 to nine since the outbreak on March 11.

The Ram Sagar Mishra Hospital, which successfully treated 97 patients, highest in comparison to other hospitals in the city so far, was closed for four days for sanitisation. The health workers and 17 indoor patients in the hospital were shifted to Lokbandhu hospital.

“The employees of the hotel where the team was staying have been asked to home quarantine themselves,” said Lucknow district chief medical officer Dr Narendra Agarwal.

Besides, an emergency medical technician, a resident of Charbagh, deployed in ambulance duty for Covid-19 was the fourth corona warrior to test positive.

The reports of the four health workers were found positive during precautionary drill under which all frontline medical personnel are tested at regular intervals. Earlier, a doctor, two nurses and paramedics each had tested positive, but all of them have recovered now.

Meanwhile, four patients were discharged from various hospitals after defeating the virus. 

So far, the city has recorded 305 Covid-19 cases, of which 237 have recovered, translating into an exceptionally good recovery rate of over 77%.
