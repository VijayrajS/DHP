Ahmedabad: Three employees of Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited have recently died of Covid-19. As many as 26 employees at the pharma company’s manufacturing facility in Dholka had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month. 

“We are terribly saddened by losing three of our colleagues. We are in touch with their families for extending all the necessary support and help,” city-based Cadila Pharmaceuticals’ spokesperson said while confirming the recent deaths of its three employees.

Two of the three employees who lost their lives to Covid-19 were from packaging division and one was from the production department. One of them was 59 years old and had co-morbid conditions with diabetes.

“We also take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the safety and well-being of our employees. We are in constant touch with all our employees who are in hospital or in quarantine,” added the spokesperson of the privately held pharmaceutical company.

The Rajiv Modi-promoted privately held pharmaceutical company’s Dholka facility is currently under shutdown. The facility, which employs around 1,200 to 1,600 workers, was shut after 26 of its employees were found Covid-19 positive.

It was perhaps the first instance in Gujarat where operations of a pharma company plant was ordered to be shut due to workers being infected with the novel coronavirus.
