U’khand govt mulling Covid-19 cess on liquor
2020-05-07
Dehradun: Reeling under heavy financial losses in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Uttarakhand government is now planning to introduce a Covid-19 cess on liquor on the lines of several other states. The Excise department has started its preparations and a decision is likely in the Cabinet meeting to be held on Thursday evening. 

The revenue target for the ongoing fiscal was increased from Rs 3,100 crore to Rs 3,600 crore in Uttarakhand. However, in wake of Covid-19, the revenue realisation has been not as per the expectations of the authorities. Taking a leaf out of the book of Delhi, which recently implemented a special coronavirus fee on liquor, the authorities of Uttarakhand are planning a move on similar line. Albeit, the cess is unlikely to be as heavy as Delhi which brought a 70% special coronavirus fee.

Principal secretary Anand Bardhan told TOI, “The preparations in this direction have started and a decision would be taken by the authorities concerned.” The senior IAS officer further added that the excise teams were working out the modalities before bringing it before the government.
