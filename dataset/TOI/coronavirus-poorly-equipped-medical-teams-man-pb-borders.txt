AMRITSAR: Digital thermometers are the only equipment Indian medical teams are equipped with for screening passengers showing symptoms of suspected novel coronaviruses arriving at Attari international border from Lahore.

Sources said district health authorities didn’t have any thermal scanner, which costs around Rs 9 lakh. The one being used at Amritsar airport has been provided by the Airport Authority of India.

According to Pakistan media reports, no confirm coronavirus case has been reported there but as many as four persons with symptoms of coronavirus were admitted in hospitals.

Gurdaspur senior medical officer Vijay Sharma said they had posted a medical team at Dera Baba Nanak international border to monitor the pilgrims arriving from Pakistan after day-long pilgrimage. The medical team screen the passengers with any physical symptoms at the border.

Meanwhile, in wake of coronavirus alarm, prices of the face masks, both surgical and N 95, have shot up. The masks are flying off the shelves.

Nanak Surgical Enterprises’ Vishal Gupta said surgical masks, which were earlier sold from Rs 3 to Rs 5 per piece were now available between Rs 5 to Rs 8.
