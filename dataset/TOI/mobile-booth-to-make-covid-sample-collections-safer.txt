Mobile booth to make Covid sample collections safer
2020-04-14
LUCKNOW: KGMU on Monday received a mobile booth which will enable medical staff to collect swab samples of suspected Covid-19 patients without coming in direct contact with them.


Already in use in different forms in some parts of the country, the booth reduces the requirement of personal protective equipment (PPE) in sampling process, thus saving kits which are in short supply.

The booth was gifted to KGMU by Era’s Medical University which has developed it in collaboration with its medical devices and services manufacturer. 

Head, medicine department, KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam said, “Currently, PPE is used to collect samples of patients. This booth will help in collecting samples without PPE.”
