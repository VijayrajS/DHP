2020-05-21
NEW DELHI: The 15 countries most impacted by Covid-19 have together reported 34 times more cases and 83 times more deaths than India, despite their cumulative population being almost equivalent to that of India, the health ministry said, underlining the fewer number of cases as well as fatalities as “relatively good news”.



Around eight persons per lakh population in India are affected by Covid-19, as against a world average of 62 per lakh even as India recorded a second consecutive day of one lakh tests. The death toll rose to 3,303 and the number of cases to 1,06,750, an increase of 140 deaths and a record jump of 5,611 cases in the last 24 hours.

On the positive side, the number of active Covid-19 cases stood at 61,149, whereas 42,298 people have recovered so far. The current recovery rate is near 40% as against 7.1% at the start of the first lockdown, 11.5% at the start of the second and 26.59% at the start of the third lockdown.





Besides, only 6.39% of the currently active 61,149 cases were on enhanced hospital care, signalling better clinical management and hospital support. About 2.94% of active Covid-19 cases needed oxygen support, 3% needed ICU and 0.45% required ventilator support.

“During lockdown, we have upgraded our hospital infrastructure, including oxygen-supported beds, ICU beds and ventilators. Our efforts give us confidence that we are ready, along with states, to manage Covid cases,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.

Whereas the global average of cases per one lakh people was 62, the number for India was 7.9. It was 115 for Brazil, 150 for Iran, 374 for Italy and 452 for the US, the health ministry analysis showed. Deaths per one lakh people in India was 0.2 as against 4.2 globally and as high as 59 in Spain, 52 in the UK and 36 in Sweden.

“While our deaths are a matter of grief, we find that six countries have reported more than 10,000 Covid-19 deaths. Together with states and citizens, we have been able to manage the situation, though the challenge continues,” Agarwal said.
