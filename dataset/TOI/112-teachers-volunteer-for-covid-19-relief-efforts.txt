COIMBATORE: At least 112 teachers from government schools in the district have signed up so far as volunteers for Covid-19 work, officials said on Monday.

Coimbatore chief education officer P Usha, who has been collecting names of volunteers, told TOI that of the 112 teachers, 36 were women.

“We have informed the district collector that these teachers are ready to volunteer in Covid-19 measures,” she said. The civil supply department, when informed of the new volunteers, said they would use male teachers for Covid-19 related work when the need arises.

Meanwhile, with no exams and no pressure upon them, other teachers not related with Covid-19 containment measures have formed WhatsApp groups with parents to inquire about the health of their students and to spread awareness messages, said Usha.
