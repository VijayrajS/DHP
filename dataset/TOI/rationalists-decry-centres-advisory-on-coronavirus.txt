Rationalists decry Centre’s advisory on Coronavirus
2020-01-31
MANGALURU: As countries around the world struggle to contain the spread of the deadly Coronavirus, the advisory of the ministry of AYUSH (ayurveda, yoga & naturopathy, unani, siddha, sowa rigpa and homoeopathy) has irked rationalists. 


Condemning the Union government’s attempt to promote quackery in the name of alternative medicine, Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA) president Narendra Nayak said: “When all the authorities including World Health Organisation claim there is neither any vaccine nor any treatment for Coronavirus, the government is promoting unproven therapies to lull people into a false sense of security that they can be safe if they consume such concoctions.”

FIRA members also questioned the silence of medical bodies on “this blatant falsehood”. 

AYUSH ministry, in a health advisory, had recommended that homeopathic and unani medicines could be effective in the prevention of Coronavirus infections.

The advisory was issued following a meeting on Tuesday of the scientific advisory board of the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) under the AYUSH ministry to discuss ways and means for prevention of the infection through homoeopathy, the ministry said in a statement.

It had recommended that homoeopathic medicine Arsenicum album 30 could be taken empty stomach daily for three days as a prophylactic medicine against the infection besides hygiene measures.
