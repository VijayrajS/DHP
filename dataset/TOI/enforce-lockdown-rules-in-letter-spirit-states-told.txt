2020-04-02
NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday cautioned states against allowing exceptions to the lockdown other than those permitted under the consolidated guidelines issued by the home ministry under the Disaster Management Act. The warning came in the wake of states like Kerala and Meghalaya allowing sale or home delivery of liquor for "health" reasons. 

 No exception for sale or delivery of liquor is allowed under the home ministry guidelines. In a letter to state chief secretaries, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said allowing exceptions other than those in the guidelines was a violation of lockdown measures and defeated the efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. 

 "All state governments/UT administrations are requested to strictly implement the lockdown measures issued by MHA," the home secretary told the chief secretaries. The Kerala government had on Monday allowed issue of special passes for drinkers with withdrawal symptoms to purchase liquor from the excise department. They had to carry a doctor's prescription . 

 The Meghalaya government too has allowed home delivery of liquor against prescription issued by a registered medical practitioner. "Warehouses may be allowed to sell liquor as a special case up to April 14," an excise department statement said.
