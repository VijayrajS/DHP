2020-04-01
Nashik: Apart from the mobile app ‘Mahakavach’ particularly for quarantined patients,the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has developed two more mobile apps — ‘NMC Covid-19’ and ‘Nashik Bazzar’ — to help people during the lockdown.

Those who have come from abroad or those who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients may fill up their information on ‘NMC Covid-19’ app. With this application, the administration’s task of finding out who has returned from foreign/affected countries has reduced to a great extent. People can voluntarily inform authorities about the same via this app. 

“Once any such information has been received on the app, the municipal corporation will immediately send medical teams who will take necessary medical precaution,” said NMC officials. 

“Moreover, this ‘NMC Covid-19’ app will also have all the necessary contact numbers of doctors, hospitals, news feeders, food donors, shelters, etc. This will help common people to get in touch with the necessary services,” said officials. 

In addition, another mobile app — ‘Nahik Bazzar’ — will help city residents to order groceries and get home delivery. The app will have a list of grocery shops and other essentials.

The residents will have to place order through the app and the items ordered will be delievered at their doorstep.

The NMC has developed the grocery special app in association with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA).

Citizens can download these mobile apps from ‘nmc.gov.in website.
