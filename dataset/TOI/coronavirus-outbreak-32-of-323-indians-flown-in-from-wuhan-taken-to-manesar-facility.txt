GURUGRAM: Thirty two of the 323 Indians from Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, flown to India on Sunday morning were taken to the Army's quarantine facility in Manesar.


 "Today (Sunday), around 11.30am, a batch of 32 individuals who arrived in India was brought to our quarantine facility at Manesar after an initial round of screening at the airport. They were taken to the centre with the same protocol that was followed yesterday (Saturday)," an Army officer told TOI . 



On Saturday, an Air India flight had evacuated 324 Indians from China, of which 220 had been taken to the Manesar facility set up at the Army training centre near the NSG camp.

All 252 people who have returned from China till now have been put up in 16 barracks in segregated sectors. Those in one sector cannot come in contact with those from others. 

 "Initially, they were a little surprised. They were hoping to go home. When they got to the camp and were briefed about the rules, they were a little anxious. But our officers spoke to them and they are now at ease," a senior Army officer said. 

 A 15-second video in which a group of people at the centre can be seen dancing to a Haryanvi song was shared with the media earlier in the day. About the medical protocol, Army officers said there is no need to panic.
