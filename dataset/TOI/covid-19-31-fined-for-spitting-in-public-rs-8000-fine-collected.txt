2020-03-17
Vadodara: With the state government embarking on major preventive measures against COVID-19, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) too has followed suit. Apart from a major awareness drive, the civic body has also started cracking down on those spitting in the open.The civic body has become aggressive after state government directives and fined 31 persons spitting in the open in the city. A fine of Rs 8,100 was also collected from the erring citizens. While a fine of Rs 500 was fixed by the state government for the nuisance, the actual amount was low as many who were spotted spitting did not have sufficient money.As a part of the awareness drive, VMC will be putting up hoardings, banners and posters across the city. Officials said that stress will be laid on reaching out to people visiting places like busy market places, bus stands, using city and state transport buses as well as gardens.All LED screens put up by the civic body at junctions in the city will have messages on prevention of COVID-19. Officials said that other means of creating awareness were also being adopted including the use of mass media.Officials of the civic body are still getting lists of passengers from affected countries who have landed in India. “We are scrutinizing these and reaching out to the citizens who are within the Vadodara limits,” said an official. Incomplete and vague addresses in these lists have, however, become a routine affair and officials are forced to make calls to such persons to ascertain their locations.
