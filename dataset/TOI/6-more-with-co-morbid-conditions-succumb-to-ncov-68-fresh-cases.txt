PUNE: Six more critically ill patients diagnosed with Covid-19 infection succumbed to associated complications at different hospitals in Pune on Wednesday.





Besides, 68 people tested positive for the contagion on Wednesday, taking the total case count to 881 in Pune Metropolitan Region. “With the fresh deaths (see box), the tally in PMR has reached 59 so far,” a health official said, adding, “All the patients had co-morbidity issues.” 

Technical expert to state government Dr Subhash Salunkhe said all efforts were being taken to ensure that private hospitals also take on the responsibility for treating patients with co-morbidities. “The technical team appointed would guide them instead of sending all such patients to Sassoon hospital,” he said.

When it comes to 68 fresh cases in PMR, a total of 66 were reported from PMC limits, while 1 each from PCMC limits and rural areas.
