After big cos, startups target Covid-centric products
2020-04-24
Ahmedabad: Desperate days call for different measures! Taking cue from large-scale manufacturers who have moved into masks and hand-sanitizers and other products to aid the fight against Covid-19, several startups too have now taken to manufacturing Covid-centric products.

Ahmedabad-based Axio Biosolutions has recently rolled out a range of surgical hand-disinfectants and hand-sanitizers from a unit with a manufacturing capacity of 25,000 litres at present. The plan is to expand the capacity to 100,000 litres in the coming days. Leo Mavely, founder & CEO, Axio Biosolutions, said, “For India to tackle the pandemic, we need to address the large-scale shortage of quality hygiene and safety products. Our priority is to meet the urgent demands from hospitals and institutions in India, followed by other regions.” 

As part of Gujarat University Start-up and Entrepreneurship Council’s breakthrough challenge, Arpit Almal, founder, Anaha Tech has also come up with a solution that can add anti-microbial properties to textile fabrics. “It’s a nano-tech composite material which is used to treat textiles. Currently, we’re in talks with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for treating bedsheets that can be used on hospital beds. The treated textiles will kill germs without washing the textile. It can have multiple applications for aprons of doctors, bedsheets, curtains, table covers and other surfaces,” confirmed Almal, whose firm will be treating some 500 bedsheets for the civic authorities next week.
