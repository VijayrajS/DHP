BHOPAL: Amid the coronavirus threat and increasing positive cases in Madhya Pradesh, acting chief minister Kamal Nath on Sunday directed top officials to maintain a complete shutdown by closing all business establishments in the state.

“After discussions with chief secretary and the DGP, the acting chief minister has asked to maintain adequate vigilance in the state in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. He also directed a complete shutdown by closing all business establishments in the state as per the requirement,” said Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja. Nath, who resigned on March 20 amid the political crisis in the state, also called upon the public to voluntarily close their establishments and stay at their homes, not to organise social gatherings and undertake trips to prevent the coronavirus epidemic from spreading in the state.

“People should avoid crowded places and immediately inform the authorities about any suspect or infected person. I reiterate that due to preventive measures to control coronavirus, such as closure of markets, closing of commercial areas and offices, small shopkeepers, traders and daily workers are facing problems to earn their livelihood,” said Nath.
