CHANDIGARH/AMBALA: Haryana police and health officials on Tuesday raced to track people who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi earlier this month at its Nizamuddin West headquarters, which has turned into a novel coronavirus hotspot. 


As many as 159 persons, including 32 foreigners, with links to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation were quarantined across Haryana during the day-long drive. The search operations for people linked to the Jamaat were carried out throughout the state. 

Punjab has identified nine and Himachal 17 people who attended the congregation.

However, Haryana home minister Anil Vij, who also holds the charge of health ministry, said the state had no definite numbers as yet but he had asked the state home secretary to compile details of persons from Haryana linked to the Jamaat. "Our teams are working and we are hopeful of getting a clear picture by Wednesday evening, The home secretary too has been directed to compile the records," said Vij.
