Vijayawada: Supply chain issues continue even after easing of lockdown
2020-06-14
VIJAYAWADA: Disruptions in supply chain caused by the Covid-19 lockdown are yet to settle down as many products are still not available in the city. While the issue has caused unavailability of some items, changes in food habits have resulted in shortage of many essential products.

City merchants say they witnessed an unprecedented demand for ready-to-eat products and wheat flour (atta) during the lockdown. The high demand for atta during summer was unusual, they said. 

M Sambasivarao, who runs a kirana store in Poranki, said people normally but more atta in winter as many do not prefer chapati or other food items made from atta during summer. “We ran out of atta stock within a few days, but could not get atta stocks as per the demand due to supply chain issues during the lockdown. Even now we are getting atta in limited quantities from suppliers while the demand is still high from consumers,” he said.

Ready-to-eat items like instant noodles and pasta have seen a spike in demand, so too have biscuits and other snacks. J Karteek, who runs a general store, said the racks of ready-to-eat products became empty within one week of the lockdown. “As supply chain issues still persist, we are yet to get all the products,” he said.

Some FMCG products like a noted brand of quick adhesive, tea powder, cosmetics, hair colours and soaps are still not available as per demand and are selling at a premium.
