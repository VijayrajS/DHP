NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 count in the country continues to rise sharply, with each day’s fresh cases surpassing the previous day’s high. As many as 388 new infections were reported on Wednesday — up from 315 on Tuesday — as Tamil Nadu registered a three-figure number for the second straight day and Andhra Pradesh more than doubled its count of cases overnight.


India’s Covid-19 count stood at 1,996 at 11.45pm on Wednesday, having galloped from close to 1,000 to nearly double that number in four days.

Mumbai recorded as many as six covid-19 deaths in a span of 24 hours on Wednesday although local authorities have confirmed only two.

Coronavirus infections also rose sharply in Delhi to a new single-day high of 32 while the spread of the virus appeared to slow a bit in the worst-hit state, Maharashtra, which reported 33 fresh cases, down from 82 on Tuesday.

Rajasthan (27), Kerala (24) and MP (20) were the other states to report big single-day numbers. At least nine more people died of the infection in the country in the past 24 hours.





The spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi is fuelled mainly by many of the Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) members and their contacts, who have been put in quarantine in various hospitals, testing positive for the disease. The state has recorded 152 Covid-19 cases till date. Of this, data shows, 53 (35%) cases are linked to the TJ meet. Officials said the number of cases is likely to go up further as 536 TJ members and their contacts who are admitted in hospitals are highly symptomatic.

At least six doctors in the state have also been found to be positive for Covid-19. Most of them have travel history or contact history, sources said.

Meanwhile, Assam reported a surge of 12 new infections just a day after the first case was detected in the state.

The death toll due to Covid-19 in the country has gone up to 57, as per data shared by various states. Of this, the health ministry has confirmed 41 deaths.

Maharashtra has now recorded 335 positive cases so far and 16 deaths, the highest in the country. Telangana reported 12 new cases Covid-19 cases and one death on Wednesday, taking the state’s total count to 104 cases and seven deaths. Most of them are linked to the TJ meet in Delhi.

Gujarat on Wednesday recorded the sharpest spike in coronavirus positive cases with 13 being reported, eight of which were from Ahmedabad, two each were from Surat and Porbandar and one from Panchmahal, the first for the tribal district.

A 25-year-old youth from Basti district in UP turned out to be Covid-19 positive on Wednesday, almost 48 hours after he died at BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur. This is the first coronavirus death in UP and perhaps the youngest person to die because of the infection. The state reported another death on Wednesday.

In Madhya Pradesh, 19 more patients have tested positive for Covid-19 in Indore, taking the state’s tally to 63. Indore, which is in total lockdown, accounts for 73% of MP’s tally of 86.

In West Bengal, two persons who had tested positive for Covid-19 died on Wednesday. In Bihar, a 35-year-old man from Nalanda and a 40 year old woman from Gaya — both with travel history to the UAE—tested positive on Wednesday, taking the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the state to 24. The two had recently returned from Abu Dhabi and Dubai respectively.

Seven more fresh Covid-19 cases were detected in Jammu and Kashmir on, taking tally of patients to 62 across J&K.
