2020-04-18
Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Friday stated that there has been “an exodus” of people into Goa from Belagavi, which has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases. He has brought it to the attention of chief minister Pramod Sawant and has assured him that an appropriate action will be taken.

“The exodus of people from Belagavi to Goa is a grave concern ,” said Rane.

Rane said he has written a letter to the chief minister and the chief secretary,apprising them of the happenings at the Keri outpost.

“Entry of passenger vehicles into the state of Goa should be stopped. This is because Covid-19 cases are doubling in Belagavi,” he said. 

He said he has received information from panchayat members of his constituency in Valpoi that Belagavi people are entering Goa by bypassing the police at Keri outpost.

Since last month, Goa borders with Karnataka and Maharashtra have been sealed due to rise of Covid-19 cases in both the states.Presently, only vehicles carrying essential goods are permitted entry.

Goa relies heavily on Belagavi for supply of vegetables and fruits. 

It is suspected that people from Karnataka are sneaking into Goa either through unmanned interior roads or through jungle routes after sunset. Goa police say that strict vigil is maintained at all police outposts to prevent people from gaining entry illegally. Only those with valid travel permits are allowed to enter.
