THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state committee of the Indian Medical Association has opposed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan giving the nod to preventive homoeo medicines.

On Tuesday, the CM had said that the government has decided to allow the distribution of homoeo preventive medicine for Covid-19.

"World over several efforts are ongoing to discover a vaccine and a remedy for the Covid-19. At this time the state government should not support a medicine that has not been scientifically proven as effective for Covid-19. Even the Supreme Court has said it is not the time for experimenting,’’ said Dr Abraham Varghese, state president of IMA.

The IMA argued that the government's decision will create confusion in people as they would believe that this medicine is going to make them safer. The health guidelines in place are regarding the treatment and prevention of the Covid-19 and so far there are no scientifically proven preventive drugs available.

IMA general secretary Dr P Gopakumar said the state government would be responsible for the all eventualities caused due to this decision. If the people are not taking adequate preventive steps advised by the WHO and are taking such medicines, then no one should be blamed for it, he said.

The state IMA leadership said that while various international agencies are at the forefront of developing a medicine, the state government should not have come up with such an order. "The IMA requests the government to immediately withdraw the decision," informed the IMA leadership in the state.
