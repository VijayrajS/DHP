“There is always a possibility of the stamped citizens flouting the norms and not adhere to home quarantine. In such cases, health teams and police officials have been asked to keep monitoring on them. Alert citizens too play a crucial role in letting know the administration about such citizens,” he said, adding that staying indoors is the need of the hour to protect yourself and others from contracting the infection.

He added that Sangli administration is also going to keep watch on such citizens via mobile application featuring geo-sensors soon.
