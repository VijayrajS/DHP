DEHRADUN:　To boost Covid-19 testing in the state, Uttarakhand cabinet on Friday cleared a proposal to approve testing by private labs. The steps adopted by Uttar Pradesh and other states in this regard would be studied and a tender would be floated within four days to shortlist the labs, the cabinet decided. 

“The test will be free of cost for the patient and the state government will pay for it,” state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said. In some relief to people wishing to get back to their homes in different districts within the state, the cabinet decided that no passes will be needed for intra-state movement and online registration done by the applicant will suffice. “The application number will be regarded as permission to move from one district to another. No one will be quarantined in the process,” Kaushik said.

In another major decision, the cabinet decided that for the ongoing financial year, government employees will contribute one day salary each month to the CM Relief Fund. Besides, politicians holding key positions in various boards and corporations will provide five days’ salary every month to CM Relief Fund for the ongoing financial year.

To ensure that works in villages was not impacted, the state government has brought an ordinance to fill the vacant posts of panchayat, block members and pradhans for six months. 

For a person who is Covid-19 positive or has coronavirus symptoms and has been quarantined, the state government has approved a proposal under which the owner of the commercial establishment will have to grant paid leave for up to 28 days. “On their part, employees will have to provide required medical certificate to the employer," Kasuhik said.
