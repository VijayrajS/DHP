Mumbai: Two PhD students from Maharashtra, who chose to stay back in Wuhan when the first batch of Indians was evacuated in January after the novel coronavirus outbreak, landed in Delhi on Thursday.

Girish Patil (29) and Chandradip Jadhav (29), who were studying at the College of Materials and Metallurgy, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, had opted to stay back in Wuhan—the epicentre of the outbreak—due to financial constraints. From Delhi airport, the students, along with other Indians from Wuhan, were sent to the quarantine centre at Chawla camp, where they will be lodged for the next 14 days.

Patil and Jadhav, both residents of Dhule, were among the bunch of six Indian students who stayed back in the university’s dormitory, when the first plane was sent to China to get Indians back. One of the six students said that now the university has officially extended the holidays for a few months. They also gave them a no objection certificate (NOC) for evacuation, he added. Students are now able to take advantage of online classes organized by the university. 

Meanwhile, the special Air-India flight that brought back 119 Indian and five foreign nationals from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise liner from Japan early on Thursday morning includes two Mira Road residents. Mira Road’s Dinesh Thakkar was at the forefront of the effort to get back his daughter Sonali who worked as a security personnel in Diamond Princess. “My daughter spoke to us briefly on landing and after reaching the army quarantine spot in Haryana,” said Dinesh. He said another Mira Road resident employed on the ship is also among those evacuated.
