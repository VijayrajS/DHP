Foreign inmates, too, were being shifted to a special ward after they expressed concerns about infection. A jail source said during the screening, if any of the inmates were found with symptoms of the infection, they were shifted to an isolated section in the jail hospital. 

The source added that apart from this, the existing inmates had been informed about the symptoms and any inmate showing signs were asked to immediately inform the jail wardens. The jail officials informed that no cases of Covid-19 have been reported so far from the jail premises.

The jail hospital has been asked to keep adequate stock of saline and paracetamol. 

The inmates meanwhile, have been directed to wash their hands and use hand sanitisers after stepping out or entering their cells. They have also been advised to avoid physical contact with others during community activities or working at the jail factories. 

A special sanitisation drive was conducted at all the 16 jails, including the two women ones, where officials had cleaned the premises with sanitisers and disinfectants.

A jail source said about 70% of the prisoners were from Delhi, while about 20% from other states, the rest were either foreign citizens or NRIs. At least 60 prisoners are lodged in Tihar Jail daily for various offences.
