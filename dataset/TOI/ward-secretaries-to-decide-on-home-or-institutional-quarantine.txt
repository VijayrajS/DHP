Ward secretaries to decide on home or institutional quarantine
2020-06-14
Kolhapur: The decision to quarantine the returnees from outside the district will now be taken by ward secretaries. The call to put them in-home or institutional quarantine would also be taken by the respective officials.

The corporators on Friday urged civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti to release from this responsibility as the local returnees are forcing them to grant home quarantine in cases even when the locals are returned from the red zone areas. "To ensure strict monitoring of quarantining rules, we have now decided to authorise our officials to check all the documents of travel and medical check-up before granting institutional or home quarantine,‚Äù said a senior KMC official on condition of anonymity. 

So far, 847 people have been put in 18 institutional quarantine centres and 527 granted home quarantine for 14 days. Around 3,300 people have been discharged from institutional quarantine facilities after May 3
