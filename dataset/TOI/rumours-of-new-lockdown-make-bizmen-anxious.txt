Rumours of new lockdown make bizmen anxious
2020-06-13
CHENNAI: Rumours about another lockdown ranging from two to three weeks in Chennai and neighbouring districts have made industries in the region anxious. 

"We have just started and are trying to streamline the production process. Shutting again and restarting after a few weeks will be a huge blow. Convincing workers to come back is tough. They will think that there is something really serious in Chennai," Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturersâ€™ Association (AIEMA) president A N Sujeesh told TOI.

Recently, a section of traders and shopkeepers had said they were ready for a 15-day lockdown. "The government should have come down hard on such people and taken some of them into custody. Instead they were allowed a free run," an entrepreneur in Guindy industrial estate said.

The issue was not just limited to the manufacturing segment. Logistics firms had to convince anxious customers. "For our clients in Coimbatore and other regions, we move imports through Chennai Port and send the containers by road to their factories. As rumours spread about a complete lockdown for Chennai, they wanted us to see if the containers could be moved through Tuticorin port. We had to assure them that from March 23 onwards, when lockdown was in force, Chennai Port and Customers were operating and there would not be any problem," said V Vamsi Reddy, CEO, Fynsea Lines & Logistics.
