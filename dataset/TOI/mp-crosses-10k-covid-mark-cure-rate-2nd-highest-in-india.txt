2020-06-11
Bhopal: Just short of 12 weeks after the first Covid-19 case was detected in Madhya Pradesh, the state crossed the grim milestone of 10,000 cases on Wednesday.

With 200 new cases reported, MP’s Corona count rose to 10,049. Indore (51) and Bhopal (47) accounted for nearly half this tally. Over 2,100 of these cases have come this month, after the unlocking.

The heartening thing, however, is that MP’s recovery count is also rising. With 163 recoveries, the state cure tally rose to 6,892. MP is now second in the national rankings in recovery rate – beating Gujarat by a fraction, 68.5% to 68.4%. Exactly a month ago, on May 11, the recovery rate stood at 46.5%.

CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had on Tuesday cautioned citizens to be extra cautious in the unlocking period and reiterated the importance of wearing masks.

Worryingly, deaths are relatively high at 4.2%, while the national average is around 2.8%. MP’s mortality rate is second only to Gujarat (6.2%), with Tamil Nadu having the best figures at 0.8%.

Seven more deaths were reported on Wednesday, two of them in Indore and one each in Bhopal, Sagar, Barwani, Rewa and Shajapur districts.

New cases were in 22 districts, with Ratlam coming a surprise third (24 cases) after Indore and Bhopal. Gwalior had a dozen new Covid patients, Chhindwara 11 and Neemuch 10. There are 2,730 active patients in the state.

Reports of more than 2.28 lakh samples have been received in the state so far, 4.4% of which tested positive. The administration has declared 1,034 localities in 51 districts as containment zones. MP is ramping up its Covid-fighting infrastructure and has set up 1,197 fever clinics, where primary treatment is being provided and swab samples are taken on the basis of the symptoms, said sources.
