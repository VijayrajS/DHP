Bhopal: Fear of the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) remains a clear and present danger in Madhya Pradesh. A high-level state government meeting has been scheduled for Friday. Test reports of about six suspected patients were still awaited from NIV Pune on Thursday. It includes test reports of a patient who travelled to China. He is under treatment at AIIMS-Bhopal with severe upper respiratory tract infection. So far, no positive case of the deadly virus has been reported from Madhya Pradesh. Suspected cases have been reported from Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal, Khargone, Mandsaur and Ujjain. With increasing number of suspected cases of 2019-nCoV, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has issued a new clarification that a single upper respiratory tract sample does not rule out the 2019-nCoV infection.NCDC has directed health officials to keep tracking suspected coronavirus patients for 14 days, even after the test has turned negative. A new directive on the Union minister of health website states: ‘Kindly correlate the results with clinical findings. A negative result in a single Upper Respiratory Tract sample does not rule out 2019-nCoV infection. Hence in such cases, a repeat sample should be sent. Lower Respiratory Tract samples (sputum, BAL, endotracheal aspirate) are appropriate samples for 2019nCoV testing especially in severe and progressive lung disease’.NCDC discharge policy of suspected nCoV cases will now be governed by a patient’s provisional or confirmed diagnosis and it would be up to the treating physician to take a decision. Patient shall be monitored for 14 days after their last contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. A patient from Mandideep, a businessman, suspected for 2019-nCoV, is still lodged in a hotel, said health department sources. Tracking report of other patients is being submitted by respective district health officials on a daily basis.
