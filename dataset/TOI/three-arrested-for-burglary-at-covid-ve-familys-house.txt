Bareilly: Three persons were arrested by police on Wednesday who had allegedly burgled a Covid-19 family's empty house in city's Subhash Nagar locality on April 12.

The members of the family under quarantine were shifted to a hospital after testing positive leaving their house empty. Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Shailesh Kumar Pandey, said that they have recovered a stolen laptop, jewellery and cash from the accused. The three men hve been identified as Luvkush Verma, Aman Saxena and Akash Sahu.

One of the younger members of the family was quarantined on March 27 after he had Covid-19-like symptoms. On March 29, his report confirmed Covid infection. Later, five other members also tested positive.

The entire family was kept under observation at district hospital and were discharged only after their test reports were negative. On April 13, when they were about to get discharged, they came to know from their neighbours that some one had burgled their house. The family informed the police. And the cops found that thieves had decamped with valuables.

The SSP added that two teams under additional SP (crime) RK Bhartiya and additional SP (city ) Ravindra Kumar were formed to crack the case. The police teams raided a spot near Mother Public School located at Budaun Road and arrested the three individuals.

“Luvkush is the gang's mastermind. We have also retrieved a two-wheeler that was lifted from elsewhere. We learnt that Luvkush’s mother is involved in the crime as well. She is absconding. Raids are on to nab her,” the SSP said.
