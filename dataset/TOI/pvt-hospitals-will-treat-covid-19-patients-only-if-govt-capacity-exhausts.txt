Nagpur: Managements of private hospitals in the city heaved a sigh of relief on Sunday when district collector Ravindra Thakare made it clear that the government will use their beds for Covid-19 treatment only if the facilities in government hospitals are fully utilized.Thakre and civil surgeon, Dr Devendra Paturkar, stated that authorities have made arrangements for more than 3000 beds in GMCH, IGGMCH, NMC Hospitals, Private medical colleges and charitable trust hospitals for Covid-19 treatment and only if these beds are exhausted, discussions on execution of this order on rates for patient management in private hospitals will be held.Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA), a body of private hospitals in Vidarbha, has been raising this issue since May 21, when the public health department of the state government had issued an order highlighting rate regulation and control of 80% beds in private hospitals in case of surge in Covid-19 patients. VHA members had called on the district collector and other health authorities on Saturday and raised their apprehension over the order. NMC had also issued an order directing 13 private hospitals with more than 100 beds and 29 private hospitals with beds in he range of 50-100 to be ready to provide services to Covid-19 patients. Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe told TOI and also in an affidavit before HC that private hospitals will be used only after exhausting of capacity in government-run hospitals.“Private hospitals are deemed under NMC’s control for containing Covid-19. We had already issued an order in this regard last month considering the guidelines of the government. We will bring the hospitals into use whenever needed. Private hospitals have to be in a state of readiness,” he said.
