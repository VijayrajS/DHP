PANAJI: The all-Goa community survey announced by the state government on Monday to identify persons with symptoms of coronavirus, will be conducted using a mobile app.

A senior government officer said that training would be provided to all government employees and teachers of government and government-aided schools.

“An app has been developed for carrying out the survey. During the training, the surveyors will be asked to install the app on their mobile phones. The app will have a set of six questions prepared by the health department which will have to be answered in yes or no format,” the officer told TOI.

The survey will have questions like whether any family member has flu-like symptoms or has a travel history since February 15, apart from the basic details including name of head of the family, address and contact numbers.

For the three-day survey, which will begin from Monday, the surveyors would be provided face masks and sanitisers and will also be asked to keep safe distance and not to enter houses.

For the survey conducted under North and South Goa collectors, 17 incident commanders have been appointed - one for each taluka and five others for bigger municipal areas of Panaji, Mapusa, Margao, Vasco and Ponda. The teams will be constituted at booth level officer (BLO) level.

“This survey is being carried out in the interest of the people. At present, we have only seven positive cases of COVID-19. But we want to ensure that no person with the symptoms is at home and not taking things seriously,” the officer said.
