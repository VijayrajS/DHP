2020-03-06
Nashik: With the rising number of coronavirus cases being reported from across the country, the Nashik district administration is taking steps to discourage people from holding mass gatherings. The officials said people will not be allowed to host big gatherings unless they provide an affidavit saying that they would strictly follow the advisory against the spread of the virus.The district administration has also warned people against hoarding medicines, overcharging the same and giving false medical advice to others.Collector Suraj Mandhare — while briefing the media after the video conference conducted by state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta — said there was no reason for panic, but at the same time appealed to people to join the fight against the virus by using preventive measures.“First, we will have to stop all mass gatherings across the district to ensure that people do not come in contact with known or unknown carriers of the disease. Second, if people must conduct any event, they will have to furnish an affidavit saying that they would take all the measures required to contain the spread of the virus,” Mandhare said.The measures include ensuring at least 3-ft distance between two people, instruments to thermally scan people, ample supply of alcohol-based handwash, complete travel history of any persons coming from abroad — foreign national or Indian — and many others.The collector said this virus can be treated symptomatically, though a single compound to fight it is not available yet. Mandhare added if anyone fails to abide by the guidelines, the administration would not allow the event.The administration has also warned the chemists and druggists against hoarding medicines that may be required by the common man to treat other illnesses. “If anybody is found hoarding medicines, the medical masks and other things, the administration will take the strictest action against them. The same will be the fate of those found selling goods at exorbitant rates and the ones who are propagating fake messages through any media,” Mandhare added.
