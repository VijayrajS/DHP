2020-03-24
NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday suspended breath analyser tests for air traffic controllers immediately, saying that in this medical emergency, ATCs could not be put to further risk of infection by the novel coronavirus outbreak.


Passing interim measures, the court directed authorities to hold an urgent meeting on Tuesday to explore alternative methods for the test, which shouldn’t be invasive in nature.

Justice Prathiba M Singh also directed the Directorate General of Medical Services (Air), Delhi to meet other agencies concerned such as Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Airports Authority of India (AAI), ministry of civil aviation and doctors to draw up an alternative protocol for conducting breath analyser tests on air traffic controllers (ATCs).

It said the new protocol that will be implemented till Covid-19 abates should be placed before it by March 27 with an affidavit. It was hearing a plea by the Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild (India) seeking direction to the DGCA and AAI to temporarily suspend the tests through the current tube process.

The petitioner said that on a random basis, 10% of the ATCs are subjected to breath, which uses equipment that could result in the spread of Covid-19. According to the petitioners, testing of urine or blood sample can be used as an alternative.
