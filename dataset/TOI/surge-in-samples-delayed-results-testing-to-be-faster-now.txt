Surge in samples delayed results; testing to be faster now
2020-04-13
Nagpur: People, especially those in quarantine facilities, are eager to know results of Covid-19 tests. Nagpur now has three laboratories to test samples. Still, some results are coming after several days. Authorities explained this was because priority is given to samples of high risk contacts and close contacts of positive patients and deceased. “Samples of suspect cases already in institutional quarantine can wait as they cannot spread the virus out in community,” said an official from one of the labs in city. Moreover, some samples test inconclusive or are not collected properly. They need to be re-tested. All these technical issues can delay the results.Nagpur now has four labs that carry out Covid-19 tests and three of them functioning at their full capacity. “A standard kit that we get can conduct 50 tests. One sample has to be tested on eight controls (parameters). For this, every sample needs to undergo two tests. If tested positive or inconclusive, we have to conduct another confirmatory test,” said Dr Apurva Pavde, dean of GMCH Akola. This way, one sample needs two to four tests. It means if a laboratory is capable of conducting 200 tests, it can test 80 to 100 samples in one batch.Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had also told TOI earlier that asymptomatic suspects in institutional quarantine can be tested later, after fifth day of their admission as per the guidelines. However, after taking samples, the results are expected to come within 12 hours. “This will happen now as Nagpur has more labs. Results will come on day-to-day basis from now onwards,” said an official from GMCH.Also, a high number of samples reached city labs from all parts of Vidarbha in the last two weeks, especially after district collectors were asked to trace the individuals having Delhi travel history. This was the same period when containment drives also began in almost all districts in Vidarbha. In addition to it, the only big testing facility in Mayo Hospital (IGGMCH) developed a snag and samples had to be shifted to AIIMS lab and some to National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. All this delayed samples in the last two weeks.
