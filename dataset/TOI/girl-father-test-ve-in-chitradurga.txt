DAVANAGERE: A father-daughter pair tested positive for novel coronavirus in Chitradurga district, according to the bulletin released by the government. A 39-year-old man and his three-year-old daughter in Kodihalli in Challakere taluk were confirmed infected, and were admitted to the designated Covid-19 hospital on Friday. 


The man was residing in Chennai, along with his family, for the past 18 years. His wife recently gave birth to a second child in Chennai. Owing to the lack of people to take care of the mother and child, they decided to take a private vehicle from Chennai, and arrived at Kodihalli on May 5. 

However, on May 11, the throat swabs of the man, his wife and his daughter were sent for tests, and the results came out on Friday, confirming that the father and his daughter were infected. However, his wife has tested negative for the novel coronavirus, said Chitradurga deputy commissioner Vinoth Priya R. The 20-day-old infant, along with its mother, is currently at the Chitradurga district hospital, Vinoth Priya added.
