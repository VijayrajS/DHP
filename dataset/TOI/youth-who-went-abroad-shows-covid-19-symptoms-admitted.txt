Rudrapur: A man, in his 20s, has been admitted to a private hospital in the city after he showed symptoms of novel coronavirus on Friday. The youth is suffering from cough, fever and breathing issues. He is currently undergoing treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a private hospital in the city and his condition is told to be critical. The man had recently travelled to Germany and Turkey, however, he wasn’t quarantined.

Dr Shailja Bhatt, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of Udham Singh Nagar, told TOI, “We were informed that a patient with Covid-19 symptoms was admitted to a private hospital. Subsequently, we sent a team that collected his blood sample for Covid-19 test. His report will come by Saturday.”

Meanwhile, the former landlord of the suspected Covid-19 patient told TOI, “Around 15 days back, an Asha worker came to my house to inquire about my ex-tenant who had recently come from Turkey. I told her that he has shifted from my place and gave her the mobile number of the man’s father but it seems that the health department didn’t bother to quarantine him.”

However, CMO Dr Bhatt refutes all charges of carelessness by the department and says that the patient had come from Turkey in February but he stayed in Noida for more than a month after that. "He has been in his house for more than twenty days now. The reasons of his ailment can be ascertained only after we get the test reports. We have quarantined all the people with travel history across the district and we have been following the guidelines issued by the Centre,” she added.
