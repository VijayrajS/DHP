2020-04-11
PUNE: After moving swiftly to impose containment zones in the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has stepped up testing in the high-risk areas.


After two days of work involving health workers and police teams, the civic body said 222 symptomatic patients were found in the Covid-19 high risk areas. As many as 453 civic teams have visited nearly 1.07 lakh houses and screened over 3.8 lakh citizens in the sealed areas in the Peths, Satara Road, Kondhwa and other locations. 

Entry and exit of people in these areas has been barred after a large number of positive cases were found in here. The administration decided to study these areas as part of the containment plan and special teams were formed to screen the residents. “We are keeping an eye out for symptoms like fever, history of diabetes and hypertension. Details are also sought from the elderly about health issues,” Vaishali Jadhav, a senior official of PMC’s health department, told TOI. 

“Some residents were told to visit Naidu hospital, while others have been advised quarantine,” a senior official said.
