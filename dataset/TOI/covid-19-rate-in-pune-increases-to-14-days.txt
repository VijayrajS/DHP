2020-05-25
PUNE: The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in the city — the number of days in which the number of patients doubles — has gone up, according to data released by the Pune Municipal Corporation. 

 


According to the PMC report, the number of cases doubled at an average of every six days in March, when the first case was detected. Since then, the report indicates, the number of cases took longer to double, standing at 14 days now.

PMC officials some the increase is a good sign, as it indicates that the speed at which the disease spreads has reduced. 

“One important aim in sealing the areas was to break the chain. The increase in doubling rate can be seen as testimony to the success to this move,” a senior civic official said. 

Another civic official said the Peth areas and slum pockets are witnessing a higher number of cases compared to other parts of the city. Currently, 65 areas are in containment zones.

“The civic administration took some steps with an aim to contain the spread, and our measures have been in the right direction,” municipal Shekhar Gaikwad said. 

As per the report, between March 2 and May 21, there has been a consistent rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. On May 21, the number cases in Pune city stood at 4,017.

However, a closer reading of the data shows that the average number of daily cases has, in fact, increased. For instance, It took just four days for the number of cases to go from 64 (April 2) to 174 (April 6) — an average of 27.5 cases per day. It took 14 days for the number to increase from 2,146 (May 7) to 4,017 (May 21), but the daily average has increased to nearly 134. 

“It (the increase in daily average) can be attributed to the increase in testing and the consequent rise in positive cases. More people are getting screened now — around 200 a day in March to 1,500 daily this month,” a senior civic official said.
