After being closed for over two-months due to the lockdown the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden is all set to open for public from Tuesday, June 9. But following all precautions, the entry into the zoo premises will be with permitted only after all the necessary conditions are met by visitors. 
Sharing the guidelines for reopening of the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden, RK Singh, the Director says, “We are excited as well as cautious in welcoming back the visitors. This time tickets will have to be bought online from our website as the tickets windows at the premises will be closed for safety reasons. Also, the timings for entry will be divided into three parts with two-hour each to allow the sanitization process to take place in between the next set of visitors. The total number of persons who can take entry at a given time has been limited to 500.”


From taking routine preventive measures like thermal scanning, making wearing of mask mandatory and allowing only water bottles inside the zoo, the zoo authorities are taking all measures to ensure a safe and happy time for the visitors to the zoo. “The toy train, battery operated vehicles, food court, canteens, souvenir shop, nocturnal house and other covered areas will remain closed for the safety of the public for the time being, but the animals will be there for all to see and enjoy,” shares Singh. 
However, what may come as a disappointment is that due to the fear of the Coronavirus, entry of the elderly aged 65 and above, children below 10 years and pregnant ladies will not be allowed in the zoo as of now.
