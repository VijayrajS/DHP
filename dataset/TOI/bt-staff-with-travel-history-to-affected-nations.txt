Coronavirus scare in Bengaluru: Health dept seeks details of IT/BT staff with travel history to affected nations
2020-03-11
BENGALURU: Realising that not all international passengers arriving in Bengaluru are declaring their travel history, the health and family welfare department has asked the IT/BT department to collect from employers travel details of IT/BT workers who have visited the affected countries. 

“A lot of employees may have visited countries affected by Covid-19 in the past couple of weeks, especially after February 21. There have been cases of a few passengers wrongly declaring their travel history or missing screening at airports,” says the communication the health department sent on Tuesday. 

It wants the IT/BT department to collect details of employees who have travelled to the affected countries in a specific format, which it has provided, and forward them to its designated officers. 

The authorities’ concerns come in the backdrop of four Bengalureans, IT employees with travel history to affected countries or their relatives, testing positive for Covid-19. 

The health department also wants IT/BT companies to immediately ask all their employees to work from home if any of them has tested positive and also help in tracing primary and high-risk contacts. Workplaces frequented by the affected persons must be sanitised and fumigated. It has also said that companies must ask employees with influenza-like symptoms to work from home. 

Health commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said companies have been asked to avoid international trips for employees given the Covid-19 scenario. “It is requested to avoid unnecessary travel to Covid-19 countries. Also any mass gathering programme in the companies should be avoided or postponed as per the Centre’s directive,” said Pandey. 

However, health minister B Sriramulu said the government is mulling a ban on all international trips by IT employees and government officers. 


Travelling from Italy, Korea? Covid-19 negative certificate a must
In addition to Visa restrictions already in place, the Union ministry of health and family welfare issued an advisory on March 6 which says passengers with travel history to Italy and Republic of Korea must carry a certificate which states they’ve tested negative for Covid-19. 

“Passengers travelling from/having visited Italy or Republic of Korea and wanting to enter India will need a certificate of having tested negative for Covid-19 from the designated laboratories authorised by the health authorities of those countries. This will be enforced on March 10, 2020 and is a temporary measure till cases of Covid-19 subside,” reads the advisory which has been sent to all the IT-BT companies.
