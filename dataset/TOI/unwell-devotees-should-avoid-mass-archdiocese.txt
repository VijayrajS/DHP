The Archdiocese urged priests to sanitise their hands before distributing the holy communion and has encouraged people to have holy communion in the hand. 

People are also discouraged from shaking hands and have been asked to greet each other with folded hands. 

The letter also advises devotees to avoid kissing the cross. “Those who desire can come in a queue, make reverence with a bow and go back,” read the letter, adding that all these are temporary arrangements and will be reviewed regularly. For the time being, the Archdiocese has asked people and priests to follow the norms until Sunday, April 12.
