Sigh of relief: Marella seafarers reach Goa, to be quarantined at Patto hotel for 14 days
2020-04-29
PANAJI: Seafarers from Marella Discovery reached Goa on Tuesday. While two buses arrived by late night, one was delayed as the driver took a route through Pune to drop a seafarer off in the vicinity. 

Ports secretary P S Reddy, who was overseeing their return, said that the buses didn’t have the permit to travel via Karnataka as a result of which they travelled via Kolhapur, Kankavli and Sawantwadi to Goa.

“The delay was also a result of the heavy checking at almost each taluka in Maharashtra where movement is restricted,” Reddy said, adding that they will be quarantined for 14 days at Ginger hotel at Patto, Panaji. 

The crew will not be made to pay for the quarantine.

“Their samples will be taken and sent for testing on Wednesday,” Reddy said.

The seafarers disembarked at Mumbai port on April 23 after the central government issued the SOP for sign off. They received clearance to leave the state after their Covid-19 test results came negative. 

Meanwhile the Goa Seamen Association of India met the ports secretary and NRI commission officials, appealing to them not to charge either seafarers or their companies for the quarantine facilities.

President of the association Frank Viegas said Goa is the only state that is talking about paid quarantine.
