LUCKNOW: Drawing inspiration from his father, Dr Sunil Agarwal, a corona warrior who got infected in line of duty and died on Saturday after battling Covid-19 for weeks, Anurag, an MBBS final year student at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) on Sunday expressed willingness to join the fight against the pandemic.

Dr Agarwal, a KGMU alumnus, was cremated in electric crematorium at Vakundh Dham in the capital.

Anurag (23) said, “My father always said a good doctor cares for his patient’s life more than his own, hence I am also ready to serve in Covid-19 ward.”

“My father is a martyr and should be given state honour. I understand that state representatives could not come to funeral because of safety protocol but somebody should be present in Orai on Monday when we take his ashes home,” he said.

Dr Agarwal (58), a government doctor posted in Orai, was part of Covid-19 task force deployed in Jaulan Medical College, when he caught infection on April 16. He was admitted to KGMU on April 24 in a critical condition and was given convalescent plasma as therapy following which his condition improved and his two consecutive tests came negative, but he died due to kidney failure. His wife was also diagnosed with Covid-19 on April 24, but has recovered.

Anurag could not perform the last rites due to safety protocols and watched cremation from a distance, while his mother and sister stood outside the crematorium. Dr Agarwal had fixed his daughter’s marriage and had scheduled it on December 22, 2020.

Representatives of Indian Medical Association (IMA), National Medicos Association (NMA) and Residents Doctors’ Association of KGMU attended the funeral, apart from few friends, including Lucknow municipal health officer Dr S K Rawat, additional chief medical officer, Lucknow, Dr K K Saxena and pathologist Dr P K Gupta.
