LUCKNOW: Spike in Covid-19 cases returned in NCR on Sunday with Gautam Buddh Nagar recording 49 cases taking the district’s total to 457, the second highest in the state.

Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida) now accounts for the highest number of 171 active cases in the state.

According to government officials, keeping in view the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the national capital and also in the district, the local administration has decided to keep Noida-Delhi border sealed for movement of people.

Health officials said the state recorded 378 cases – maximum in a single day – pushing the overall Covid-19 tally to cross 8,000-mark and reach 8,125 on Sunday. The patients included 139 migrant workers. As on date, 23 districts in state have more than 100 cases. Last 24 hours also saw discharge of 192 patients taking the total number of recoveries to 4,843.

Officials said since 40% of the cases in GB Nagar traced in the past 20 days were linked to neighbouring Delhi, the movement of people should be checked to contain further spread.

DM Suhas LY said: “While a significant number of patients are residents of Noida, the others belong to neighbouring districts whose samples were tested in a Noida-based lab.”

GB Nagar was followed by Ghaziabad where 33 new patients surfaced in last 24 hours. Eastern UP districts also continued to record large number of cases with Deoria taking the lead with 20 cases followed by Ghazipur where 19 fresh cases were reported.

As many as four deaths were reported in the state taking the total number of Covid-19 casualties to 217. “One death each was reported from Agra, Meerut, Deoria and Gorakhpur,” Dr Vikasendu Agrawal, joint director/state surveillance officer at Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) said.

Meanwhile, principal secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad said, “Today, we have achieved a target given by the Chief Minister (Yogi Adityanath). We have made arrangements for more than one lakh beds under three-tier medical system of L1, L2 and L3 hospitals in the state.”
