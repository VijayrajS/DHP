DEHRADUN: With two new positive cases of Covid-19 reported on Saturday, the total number of novel coronavirus cases in Uttarakhand has reached 42.

According to the health department, a 45-year-old woman, wife of a Covid-19-positive Jamaat member, has reported positive in Haridwar district. Besides, an 18-year-old daily wager from Hathras also tested positive on Saturday. He was working in a shop in Rishikesh and attempted to go back to his hometown after the lockdown was announced in late March. He was stopped by the police at Roorkee border and was living in a shelter home with 25 other migrant labourers since the past fortnight.

“We have asked the entire staff, around eight people, of the shop to get quarantined. Also, all the workers in the shelter home have been asked to be quarantined,” said an official from the office of director general (DG) health who added that it will be a tough task for the health department to track the infection source of the 18-year-old who never come in contact with any positive patient, as per the preliminary information gathered by the health department.

Meanwhile, a Tablighi Jamaat member, found Covid-19- positive in the first week of April, tested negative twice in the past 48 hours and was discharged from Doon Hospital on Saturday. With his discharge, the number of recovered patients in Uttarakhand is now 10.

Further, in the wake of increasing number of corona patients in Haridwar district, the health department has decided to increase the capacity of isolation centres for keeping the suspected patients. Currently, over 500 isolation beds have been reserved in different hospitals in Haridwar for suspected Covid-19-positive patients and 400 more beds will now be added, health officials said.
