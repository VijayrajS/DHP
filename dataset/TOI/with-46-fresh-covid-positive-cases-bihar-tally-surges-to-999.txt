PATNA: Bihar is on the verge of crossing the 1000 mark with 46 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the total to 999 in the state. So far, 411 coronavirus patients have recovered while seven have died and there are currently 581 active cases.

State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said over 90% of the cases reported on Thursday were of migrants, who recently returned from other states. “There can be one or two exceptions, otherwise all are migrants,” he added.

For the past 10 days, the trend in Bihar has changed with a majority of cases being migrants and the number of local cases dwindling to one or two per day.

As per information shared by Sanjay, maximum cases were reported from Purnia on Thursday with nine people testing positive for the virus, followed by Lakhisarai where six people have tested positive, Jehanabad with five positive cases and Khagaria with four positive cases. Three cases each were reported from Muzaffarpur, Banka and Nalanda, while one case was reported from Nawada.

As of now, Munger has reported the highest number of cases with 122 people testing positive for Covid-19 while 65 of them have recovered. Second highest positive cases have been reported from Patna where 99 people have tested positive and 35 have recovered.

The health secretary said even though the number of positive cases had increased in the state capital, which was because a large number had recently tested positive in the BMP campus, the condition was much better. “Patna is the capital and many trains are also coming here and there is lot of movement. Still the situation is quite under control,” he added.

As per information shared by the state health society, 40,782 samples have been tested so far in Bihar and 43 positive people are admitted in three dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.
