Agra: Police on Tuesday shamed scores of people by making them do sit-ups by holding ears in public, for risking their own lives and that of others by violating the lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 scare. Some loiterers were also made to do push-ups.

In Jagdishpura, two youths wandering on streets for fun were made to do push-ups as punishment, while in Itmad-u-Daula, a woman cop made a man do sit-ups by holding ears after he was found loitering.

Since Monday, local police also engaged in shaming motorists who were caught commuting on city streets for no reason but to “watch the lockdown”. They were made to hold placards which read, “I’m an enemy of society, as I’m wandering on the street for no reason.”

SSP Agra Babloo Kumar said, “The entire district has been locked down. We are taking every step to make people stay at home and not risk their lives.”

According to police, in last two days, 93 vehicles were seized and 1,136 people challaned.
