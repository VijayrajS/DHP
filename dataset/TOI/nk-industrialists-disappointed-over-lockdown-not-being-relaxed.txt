NK industrialists disappointed over no relaxation in lockdown

Hubballi: Industrialists from North Karnataka, who were expecting the lockdown to be relaxed, so that certain select industries could function in areas which are not Covid-19 hotspots, are now disappointed over the cabinet’s decision of not allowing the movement of two-wheelers. They are still hoping that the government will ease restrictions, in the interest of the economy of the region.

Mohan Koti, former president, Gadag District Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that 30% relaxation in lockdown norms was the need of the hour in the region. “We understand the government’s situation in the current health emergency. However, the government should understand that sudden withdrawal of the lockdown is dangerous in the region or district. Ensuring that the economy does well is important. So, we were expecting phase-wise withdrawal of the lockdown. Government has said it will permit industries in villages and special economic zones or industrial townships in urban areas, however, it has not clarified how labourers will be able to come to work,” he said.

Most employees of medium, small and micro enterprises ride two-wheelers, and they are not allowed to go to work. Due to these circumstances, government should start phase-wise relaxation of the lockdown, starting with relaxing 10% of the lockdown norms. Instead of continuing the lockdown, it should impose norms like social distancing, make masks compulsory, and ensure hand sanitisers are available at workplaces. It should also strengthen the system of trace, test and treat to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
