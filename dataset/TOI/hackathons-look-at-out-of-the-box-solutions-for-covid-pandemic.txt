Chennai: ‘One could 3D print a ventilator to deal with a shortage or build an app where medical professionals can train people to help patients who may be Covid positive. With ideas and tech-based solutions brewing, virtual hackathons are being conducted by entrepreneurs and the developer community coming together and by companies such as Hacker Earth and Skillenza. At Coronathon, the dedicated hackathon conducted by developers coming together, close to 25 projects and about 1,500 people are involved. “In a span of 2 days since we went live, we have seen these people come on board. Not only will the ideas be brainstormed and developed, every Sunday, we will present these ideas – which are in the demo stages — to panellists who include industry players and officials from the government,” said Paras Chopra, one of the organisers and founder, Wingify.The hackathons would have problem statements that include solutions for online learning to help the student community using AR/VR and AI-based contact tracking solutions for healthcare and designing community maps to track the spread of the virus.Bengaluru-based Skillenza has a Rs 8 lakh prize money and sponsors from Microsoft, gaming company Unity and the government of Jharkand among others for winning ideas to solve Covid-related issues. “We have 5,000 entries so far. We are concentrating on bringing in a gaming-based approach to solve epidemic issues, tracking community cases and management of home-based quarantines, reinventing the live experience of a video class, learning apps for kids, training the trainers, or AI in education,” said Subhendu Panigrahi, founder, Skillenza. Prime Ventures-backed Hacker Earth has its hackathon going live from March 24 and would end in May. The platform has called out for developers all over the globe to develop solutions for issues on the ground. Some of its problem statements read: Analyze the data around Covid-19 events and predict potential Covid-19 cases across the globe on a day-to-day basis and Build a travel dashboard aimed at helping people traveling in the critical situation, to give them ways to take the safest route, visit nearest clinics/hospitals facilitating check-ups, etc.“Through this hackathon, we are looking to bring the global tech community together to identify solutions that can help mitigate the outbreak and its impact,” Sachin Gupta, CEO, Hacker Earth
