AP’s quarantine policy affecting industry: Travel agents
2020-06-08
Visakhapatnam: Travel agents in the state feel that the quarantine policy adopted by the state has gone for a toss and is affecting the travel industry that is already in the shambles post-lockdown.

“Now you are allowing business traveller from other states to move freely in the state. But for a resident of the state, home quarantine for 14-days is mandatory, that, too, after undergoing a Covid-19 test. There are people from Visakhapatnam who want to go out for official purpose, but are refraining because of such policy,” K Vijay Mohan, president of Tours and Travels Association of Andhra Pradesh told TOI. 

K Srinivasa Kumar, who works with a real estate firm and wants to go to Hyderabad for a very important office work, is now reluctant to move. In Telengana he can move freely and complete his work. However, as per policy of the Andhra Pradesh government he has to be in home quarantine upon return. 

“I have moved from pillar to post to find out how to escape this quarantine phase so that I can join duty soon after my return. I did not find a solution. All domestic fliers coming to Andhra Pradesh are undergoing Covid-19 test upon arrival. And even if the report is negative, 14-day home quarantine is mandatory. It seems the government does not trust its own test reports,” said Srinivasa Kumar.

Travel agents claimed that to bring normalcy in the travel and tourism sector a few countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Mauritius would start welcoming guests from July. Most of these countries want Covid-19 reports not more than 72-hour before the date of arrival. And, there is no such facility available in Andhra Pradesh. 

“The government of India is also at fault. For this type of situation there should be a norm applicable for the entire nation. If the government can’t implement it, soon countries will impose travel restrictions to India and for Indian travellers,” added Vijay Mohan.
