UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiris district registered a new case of Covid-19 on Saturday, after a gap of four days. A 24-year-old woman, a primary contact, has tested positive, authorities said.


Four truck drivers who had returned from the Koyambedu market had tested positive on May 5. Subsequently, health officials lifted samples from the primary contacts of the drivers and sent them to the Pasteur Institute of India in Coonoor for test.

While two truck drivers hail from Kilkozhikarai in Nanjanadu panchayat in Ooty taluk, the third one is from Kakkanji Nagar in Nanjanadu panchayat and the fourth is from Selas in Coonoor taluk.

As many as 77 throat swabs and blood of the primary contacts were sent for lab test, Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya said. “Only one primary contact, a 24-year old woman, tested positive for the novel coronavirus,” she said. “The woman hails from Kilkozhikarai in Nanjanadu panchayat. She has been sent to the ESI hospital in Coimbatore for treatment.”

The three areas the four truck drivers hail from have been declared containment zones. “The places are being strictly monitored. Fumigation is done on regular intervals. All essential items, including vegetables, are supplied at doorsteps,” said the collector.

Two of the four truck drivers who were under treatment at ESI hospital were discharged on Saturday. “The duo are admitted to the Ooty Government Hospital and are under observation,” said deputy director of public health Dr P Balusamy. 

With the new case, the district has 14 Covid-19 cases. Three are active.
