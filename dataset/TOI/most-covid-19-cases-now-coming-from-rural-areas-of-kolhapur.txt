2020-05-16
KOLHAPUR: The rural areas of Kolhapur and adjoining districts, which had barely reported a handful of cases till now, are suddenly registering more cases now.


Easy access to rural areas during lockdown for people returning home was the main reason for the cases in these districts. Data from the health departments revealed that around 37 of the 43 Covid-19 cases in Sangli are from rural areas, while in Satara too, most of the over 100 cases area from the rural parts.

The story for Kolhapur is no different when it comes to the rural area being affected, out of its around 26 total positive cases around 13 or more are from the rural areas of the district. The common link with all the three districts is the travel history of the ‘index patient’. 

Sangli district health officer Bhupal Girigosavi said the spread of the contagion started from those with travel history. “The administration has set up check posts and fortunately we have been able to intercept these patients. The current lot of people arriving from red zone areas will be quite challenging for the health department.

Agreeing with Girigosavi, Satara district health officer Aniruddha Athalye told TOI it was challenging at first to handle the increase in cases but containment zone is easier to set up in rural areas. “If citizens cooperate, it can be restrained with much less efforts,” he said.

Kolhapur district recorded two more positive cases on Friday. A 30-year-old man from Jambhalewadi village and a 23-year-old from Ichalkaranji tested positive for Covid-19. With this, the total number of positive patients in Kolhapur, according to the district information office’s 5.30 pm data, reached to 28. 

Meanwhile, Solapur district has recorded two more Covid-19 deaths on Friday, taking the tally of the total deaths to 24. The district also witnessed 13 fresh cases on the same day, taking the total number of positive patients to 343.
