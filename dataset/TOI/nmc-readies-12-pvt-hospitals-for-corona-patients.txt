NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has readied 12 private hospitals for treatment of positive patients of Covid-19 in case there is further increase in cases of infection. The civic body may bring these hospitals into use anytime after April 27.


TOI on April 21 had reported that municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has directed 13 private hospitals to be ready for treatment of Covid-19 positive patients.

Mundhe on April 23 issued a notification in this regard. The NMC is planning to keep government and private hospitals ready with total capacity of 5,000 beds. In the existing scenario, the capacity at IGGMCH and GMCH is around 220 beds.

The civic chief told TOI that private hospitals will be brought into use as Covid-19 centres after capacity at government hospitals is exhausted. “Need is to be prepared for every situation,” he said.

The 12 hospitals on NMC’s list have 100 or more beds each. Apart from these, 29 more hospitals with capacity of 50-100 beds have been identified and will be readied in case 12 notified hospitals are brought into use.

The NMC is also readying institutional quarantine facilities of 7,000 beds, with 1,500 beds in the first phase.

With 41 private hospitals dedicated for Covid-19 patients, the NMC is also planning to notify some other private hospitals as non-Covid-19 centres for other types of diseases.
