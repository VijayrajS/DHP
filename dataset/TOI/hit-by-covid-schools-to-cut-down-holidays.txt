HYDERABAD: From reducing future holidays to holding special classes, educational institutions across Telangana have now gone on a preparation mode foreseeing a possibility of considerable delay — almost a month — in commencement of the new academic year due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Schools had already lost many working days owing to extended Dasara holidays during the academic year 2019-20. While most schools were expected to commence classes for new academic session from March 16, principals term the present situation as an unforeseen one as they consider tweaking the calendar to beat the coronavirus shutdown.

 
 

“We may have to cut short our winter break or reduce the number of holidays meant for festivals in order to compensate for the loss of working days. However, we have asked our teachers to prepare worksheets and question banks that will be uploaded on the website for students’ access before we resume classes,” said Narasimha Reddy, principal, Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur.

“Completion of syllabus for class 9-10 students is extremely crucial. Therefore, even if we have to add more working days to the academic calendar, we shall do so to ensure that there is no compromise,” said Shailaja Gopinath, principal of Delhi Public School, Secunderabad. 

 The schedule changes are unlikely to affect those affiliated to Telangana state board. “State board schools will not have much impact as the government had already asked us to conduct half-day classes from March 16. Unlike CBSE and ICSE schools, classes for the new academic year will commence in state-board schools only by June 12,” said Brother Show Reddy, president of Missionary Schools Association.
