2020-06-12
NEW DELHI: India’s Covid-19 cases climbed to the fourth highest in the world, overtaking the United Kingdom on Thursday, even as the country reported another highest single-day rise in new infections and deaths. 


The number of fresh cases crossed 11,000 for the first time while deaths were close to 400, having gone past 8,000 in all a day earlier. By Thursday night, India had 2,98,191 cases, as per data from state governments.


The country added a record 11,442 cases during the day. Only the US, Brazil and Russia have recorded higher numbers of total Covid-19 cases than India. The country’s case count has seen a major spike in June, with 1,06,594 cases and 3,097 deaths reported in the first 11 days of the month, the third highest after Brazil and the US. Cases reported in June already account for more than a third of all Covid-19 infections reported in India since January 30. 




Fatalities reported in June (which may have taken place earlier) comprise 38% of India’s total Covid-19 toll till date of 8,105. Thursday’s surge in cases as well as deaths was mainly on account of a big spurt in the three worst-hit states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. 

Both Maharashtra and Delhi reported their highest single-day count of fresh cases as well as deaths, while Tamil Nadu reported its second-highest jump in infections and the highest deaths in a day. 

Maharashtra added 3,607 cases to take its total caseload to 97,648, having crossed Canada’s tally of 97,472. This was the first time the state reported 3,500-plus fresh cases. Its death toll of 152 deaths was also the highest for a day in 95 days since the outbreak began.
