Bhopal: The first Covid-19 patient in Sagar district, better known as TikTok man for ridiculing the idea of wearing masks in videos, has tested negative on Saturday. The young man now code-named as P1 was discharged from Bundelkhand Medical College (BMC) exactly 15 days after he tested positive on April 10. 

TikTok man was accorded a red-carpet reception by doctors of the BMC after he was discharged on Saturday. Wearing a baseball cap, P1 showed gratitude to the healthcare workers with folded hands. 

The dean of the medical college said, “It’s good to see the young man after he recovered from the deadly virus.” He said that P1 has been asked to be in home quarantine for the next 14 days. 

Till Saturday, there are four more Covid positive patients in Sagar district.

Soon after P1 tested positive on April 10, two videos went viral. The first video showed him mocking the idea of wearing masks. The second video was made by him after he tested positive and was heard requesting friends to pray for him.

Incidentally, one of the four Covid-19 patients in Sagar is also a friend of P1, who was his partner in creating the TikTok videos.
