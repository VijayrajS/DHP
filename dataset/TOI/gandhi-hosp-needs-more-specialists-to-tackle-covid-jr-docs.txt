Hyderabad's Gandhi Hospital needs more specialists to tackle Covid: Junior doctors
2020-06-12
HYDERABAD: Many junior doctors working in Gandhi Hospital say the Covid-19 ward lacks adequate doctors from pulmonology, general medicine, anaesthesia and other departments for critical care patients. 


“Of the total junior doctors, the whole stress of Covid-19 critical care patients’ burden is being taken up by nearly 200 junior doctors from pulmonology, general medicine and anaesthesia who are working 20-day shifts in a month,” said one of the PG doctors. Though officials have claimed adequate doctors in the state, the junior doctors claimed that there is a lack of specialists. 

“A surgeon will hardly be needed in the acute medical care unit (AMCU), a paediatrician will have few cases, same with a gynaecologist. The specialists, who are few, handling the AMCU cases are already tired and exhausted. We need more doctors in the hospital to handle these many Covid-19 cases,” said Naveen Reddy, a paediatrician.

A PG doctor said he gets a quarantine of three days after working for seven days, another doctor said he hardly gets quarantine time. 

“Immediate recruitment of specialist doctors, nursing staff, patient care providers, technicians and ward boys is needed,” said a doctor.

“As a surgeon, I can only act as supporting staff in Covid-19 critical care unit. If the hospital is decentralised, the burden of specialist doctors will reduce, while other doctors can attend other patients. The government is neglecting the fact that there are other existing diseases apart from coronavirus,” said Dr Sai, a PG doctor.
