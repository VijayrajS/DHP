Kendrapada: Amid the fear and uncertainty let loose by a pandemic that is threatening human existence itself, the district is witnessing a baby boom. And despite the dread the novel coronavirus has been spreading, many parents are calling their newborns ‘Corona’.

Jharana Das (26), wife of Ranjan Das in Karilopatana village of Kendrapada, gave birth to a daughter on Saturday. “The daughter was born in the district headquarters hospital in Kendrapada. We named her Corona,” said Ranjan.

Joshnyarani Rout (24), wife of Krushna Chandra Rout, from Kulasahi village gave birth to a daughter on Monday morning. She, too, was named Corona. “We decided to name her Corona as she was born during the lockdown period,” said Joshnyarani.

“The word corona has no meaning in Odiya language. The closest one comes to is karuna, meaning kindness,” said Dr Basudev Das, a researcher and member of Odisha Sahitya Academy. 

Badal Hazara and wife Subhakanti chose to go ahead with the second option. The couple from Suniti village welcomed a son on Monday. “We decided to name my son Karuna (kindness),” said Badal.

Malati Behera (23), wife of Ajaya Behera of Iswarapur village, gave birth to a daughter in the CHC at Rajnagar on Tuesday. “To remember the lockdown, we decided to name our daughter Lock,” Aajya said.

Some 21 years back, the coastal district was torn apart by the Super Cyclone. In its aftermath, many parents named their children as Barsha (rain) and Paban (wind). “During last year’s Cyclone Fani, many named their children Fani,” said Biraja Pati, a social worker in the district. This time, parents have taken a liking for corona.
