2020-03-30
LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday appealed to UP natives stuck in other states to stay put till the lockdown was lifted. 


Yogi, however, asked the natives, most of whom are daily wagers, to contact the nodal officers appointed by the UP government if they needed any help. “People should follow the lockdown and not step out of homes and walk all the way to their homes in UP,” the CM said. He assured that the government would address the problems being faced by them. “People should not put their lives at risk by not following the process of social distancing,” the CM said, while announcing that the state government was in the process of setting up sanitized temporary shelter homes for migrants.

On Sunday, the CM also visited the Mohaan Road toll plaza in the city — which is the entry/exit point for Lucknow-Agra expressway — and reviewed the arrangements to quarantine the hordes of migrants returning to UP from other states. Yogi directed the officials to get the health checkup of migrants done, quarantine them and admit those found infected with corona virus to hospitals. The CM even met some of the migrants and sought feedback about the arrangements done by the state government.
