In the statement issued by the Indian Federation of app-based transport workers, the unions has said that drivers and food delivery riders are currently risking their safety as no advisory or emergency measures are in place for them.

“Millions of app-based riders continue to ferry passengers and food even in cities where quite a few individuals have already been diagnosed. There has been a case of Pune-based cab driver testing positive, who was shuttling a couple from Mumbai airport to Pune,” the statement read.

General secretary of the union, Sheikh Salauddin, said that drivers don’t have the luxury of working from home and they have to venture out in public to earn their living. 

Delhi-based Kamaljeet Singh, the national vice-president, said that companies should set up a task force to ensure continuous monitoring and support to all stakeholders.
