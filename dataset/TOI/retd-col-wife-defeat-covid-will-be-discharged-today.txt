Lucknow: The 75-year-old retired colonel and his 73-year-old wife fighting with novel coronavirus infection for nearly a month at Central Command’s Base Hospital emerged victorious on Tuesday when their two consecutive test reports came negative. 

“Both the elderly patients will be discharged on Wednesday,” said defence PRO Gargi Malik.

“The ex-serviceman and his family have successfully won many battles in life. Now, they have emerged triumphant from the 48-day crisis which first saw their daughter-in-law down with the infection. After they fell sick, their two-and-a-half-year-old grandson was also affected by Covid-19,” a family friend told TOI. “All have recovered now and back to serving society, with the daughter-in-law donating her plasma which is being used to treat another critical patient,” he added.

A 1969 MBBS graduate,the colonel was in the third batch to graduate from Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University. He served Indian Army as a doctor for over 20 years. He also served at many places after superannuation.

The family had no inkling that a time for a memorable vacation would turn into an ordeal, when the elderly couple’s son and daughter-in-law, both doctors in Toronto, had arrived with their child in Lucknow on March 2. 

On March 10, the daughter-in-law was found positive and became Lucknow’s first Covid-19 patient. The family was then tested and found negative, but isolated for two weeks. The woman recovered on March 21 and was trying to overcome her mental trauma, when her mother-in-law was diagnosed with the same disease on March 31 and father-in-law on April 1. On April 6, the child too was found to be infected. 

“Though the family has recovered, it will remain in self isolation for two more weeks as a precaution and tested regularly for possibility of a relapse,” said a district health official.
