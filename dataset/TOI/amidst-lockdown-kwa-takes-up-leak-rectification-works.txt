Thiruvananthapuram: Amidst lockdown, the Kerala water authority (KWA) has been successfully taking up leak rectification works in the district. An average of 25 leak rectification works are being carried out in the district everyday. 

On Saturday, KWA had successfully rectified hidden leaks on a pipe, which was the major reason for the water shortage at Pattom. Though KWA is considered as an essential service, emergency maintenance works are tedious at the time of lockdown. 

The residents of NSP Nagar have been complaining about water shortage for the past few days. When KWA began checking manholes in the area, an increased flow was noticed in one of them, hinting presence of leak. Following this, workers began inspecting the links for leaks. They noticed two hidden leaks in the 90 mm PVC distribution line. The leak was rectified on Saturday and distribution was normalised in the area. 

KWA officials said though the workers are given pass, it was difficult to carry out the works at the time of lockdown. “It is especially difficult to get the spare parts. Now, we exchange necessary parts with other KWA offices,” said an official. 

Superintending engineer Suresh Chandran said it was also difficult to arrange food for workers. “When we informed, the Sasthamangalam councilor arranged food from community kitchen for the workers,” he said, adding that KWA was working in a systematic way to ensure that the spreading of the Covid 19 would not affect the essential service. “We have maintained only a skeletal staff at Aruvikkara. The entire staff has been divided into three groups. One group will be active and two others will be kept as reserved,” he said.

“As public health is a concern, we have ensured that sewerage system is unaffected,” he Chandran said.
