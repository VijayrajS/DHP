BHOPAL: Police and health teams in MP's Morena district are racing to track and isolate more than 700 people who had participated in a shraddh feast thrown by a family, 12 of whose members have tested positive for Coronavirus. 

 All the names were on an invitee list in a diary seized by officials from the patients' house on Saturday. Morena got its first Covid-19 patients when a couple tested positive on April 2. The husband had returned from Dubai recently but showed no symptoms of corona infection. Neither did his wife. But the administration decided to have the two of them tested. 

 A day after the couple tested positive, 10 members of the family - including eight children - tested positive. The man informed health minister on Friday that he had organised a shraddha feast at his home that was attended by friends and relatives. "According to the diary entry, 700 people from different villages in five blocks were invited to the feast. We have screened 500 of them on Saturday and no one has any symptom. But they have all been sent in home isolation. The feast was organized on March 20, and 14 days are already over. The remaining 200 people will be screened on Sunday," collector Priyanka Das. 

Morena chief medical and health officer Dr RC Bandil said, "This happened on March 20. By then, orders had been issued that gatherings of more than 50 people were prohibited, yet so many people participated in this feast.
