Meerut: At least 20 inmates at Baghpat jail, who have been showing symptoms akin to coronavirus infection, were quarantined at a separate ward, said senior jail officers on Monday. 

“Their tests to confirm corona infection are being conducted, while new inmates coming to the jail have been asked to undergo a thorough medical check-up,” said a senior jail officer. 

A delegation of senior officials led by Baghpat district magistrate Shakuntala Gautam and superintendent of police Pratap Gopendra Yadav, meanwhile, inspected the jail hospital on Monday afternoon. 

“The inmates suffering from fever and cough have been shifted to a separate ward and their tests are being conducted. The jail superintendent has been instructed to maintain cleanliness and hygiene on the premises,” said the DM.

Similar surprise checks were also conducted by senior officials of the UP prison administration to take stock of the prevailing condition in the jails across the state. Necessary advisory for maintaining cleanliness, hygiene and social distancing was also issued, said a senior jail official.

Meanwhile, the apex court on Monday directed all states and the Union Territories to set up high-level committees to identify prisoners who could be released on parole of four to six weeks to avoid overcrowding of jails as a safeguard against the spread of coronavirus.
