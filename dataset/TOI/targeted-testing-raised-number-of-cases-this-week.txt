Bihar: ‘Targeted testing raised number of cases this week’
2020-05-03
PATNA: Even after completing two stages of the lockdown, the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing in Bihar with the maximum 246 positive cases reported between April 25 to May 1.


The last week of the last month also had the maximum 69 positive cases on a single day on April 27. The total number of positive cases between April 18 and 24 stood at 138. This was five times more compared to its previous week of 25 Covid-19 cases in the state.

Initially, the numbers were quite less. For instance, there were nine cases in the first week (from March 22 to 27), followed by 22 between March 28 and April 3, 29 between April 4 and 10 and 25 fresh cases next week between April 11 and 17.

Principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar cited two reasons for the increase in the number of Covid patients in the state. “First, state government is doing more targeted testing. For every positive case, his contact and infection trend is worked out and identified. These contacts are segregated and tested again. We are breaking the chain,” he told TOI.

He also cited the coming back of migrants to Bihar as another reason. When asked whether the government was expecting the number of Covid-9 cases to shoot up as stranded persons have started returning, Sanjay said: “We need to be very vigilant.”

Sanjay claimed that Bihar has fewer number of Covid cases as compared to other parts of the country and across the globe.

Also, there has been slight improvement in the number of recoveries in the past two days. For instance, 14 people recovered on May 1 taking the total number of recoveries from coronavirus to 98. A day before, 19 people had recovered. While one person had recovered on April 29 and seven on April 28.
