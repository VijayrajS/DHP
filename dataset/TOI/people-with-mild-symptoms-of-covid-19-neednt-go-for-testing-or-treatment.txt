People with mild symptoms of Covid-19 needn't go for testing or treatment
2020-03-13
Kochi: Kerala government has advised patients with mild symptoms of Covid-19 not to come to hospitals for testing and treatment. It doesn’t matter whether they have returned to the state from Covid-19-affected country or are primary or secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients. This comes amid World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring Covid-19 a pandemic and scare of spread of the disease in the community in the state.

“Testing is not going to change either the clinical course or management of the patient with mild symptoms,” said the revised guidelines for testing, quarantine, hospital admission and discharge for Covid-19 signed by principal secretary (health) Dr Rajan N Khobragade.

The new revised guidelines issued on Thursday say the epidemiology of Covid-19 shows that 75% to 80% of the affected will develop only mild symptoms which do not require hospitalisation. Severe and infection and mortality are seen only in high-risk groups like elderly and those with chronic lung disease, heart disease, liver disease, renal disease, malignancies, immunocompromised, pregnancy, post-transplant, hematalogical disorders, HIV and those on chemotherapy or long-term steroids.

Making it clear that the epidemiology of Covid-19, SARS and MERS clearly demonstrate that hospitals act as amplifying centres for the epidemic, the guidelines states, “This happens due to the mixing of patients with different risk categorization in the busy outpatient areas of designated Covid-19 centres”.

 “In majority of patients with mild symptoms, there is no need for hospitalisation or symptomatic management. Just like any viral infection, Covid-19 also will resolve by itself in majority of the patients,” the guidelines added.

Health officials have already started implementing the revised guidelines from Thursday. “This will help stop the spread of the infection in the community and avoid unwanted rush at Covid-19 isolation wards. Many of the patients who arrived from Italy on Thursday and had mild or no symptoms were send to home quarantine in an ambulance,” said Dr Joseph Chacko, president, Kerala Government Medical Officers' Association (KGMOA).

Further to ensure that there is no spread of Covid-19 in the local community, health officials said that it has been decided that in patients with viral pneumonia, Covid-19 testing maybe considered even if they are not from a country or area with local transmission of the corona virus and will be decided by the institution or district medical board.
