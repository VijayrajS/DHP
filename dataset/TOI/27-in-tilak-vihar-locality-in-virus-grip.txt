NEW DELHI: A day after 26 members of an extended family in Jahangirpuri tested positive for Covid-19, a similar case has emerged in west Delhi in which 27 people living in close proximity were found infected with the virus.


West district officials said the Widow’s Colony in Tilak Vihar was made a containment zone with restrictions imposed on the movement of the residents of the area. A densely populated colony, it houses a large number of women who had lost their husbands in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

Sources said that district health officials had taken the samples of 80 people after a 72-year-old woman from the area died at RML Hospital on April 13 and cremated two days later. The test results, received after her death, revealed that she was infected with novel coronavirus.

“The results of 30 of the 80 samples came out positive. Those who have symptoms will now be shifted for treatment, while regular testing and monitoring of asymptomatic people will be carried out,” an official said.

Meanwhile, the samples of the seven family members and two neighbours of the food and supply inspector, whose father died of Covid-19 on Friday, came out negative on Sunday. Officials, however, said they will continue to remain in home quarantine.
