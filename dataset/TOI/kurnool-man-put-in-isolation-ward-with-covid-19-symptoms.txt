A 27-year-old man with symptoms of novel coronavirus was admitted to the Government General Hospital in Kurnool on Monday. The man, who had returned from Germany on March 4, had fever and cough. 

The district medical and health officer Dr Rama Giddaiah, said the man returned to the country with the symptoms but did not raise an alarm. There are reports that he, however, first approached private hospitals for treatment.

It was the surveillance teams, which finally managed to find the COVID-19 suspect and shifted him to the isolation ward at the GGH on Monday.

Meanwhile, Kurnool GGH superintendent Dr GS Ram Prasad said the man’s blood samples have been collected and dispatched to Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences in Tirupati for testing.

Dr Ram Prasad stressed on the importance of self-reporting, and said that anyone who returns from abroad must report to the authorities if they develop symptoms of coronavirus. “They can contact 104 to inform us to reduce the chances of spreading the disease,” the superintendent added.
