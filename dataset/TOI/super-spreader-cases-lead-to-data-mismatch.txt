Covid-19 in Ahmedabad: Super spreader cases lead to ‘data mismatch’
2020-05-17
AHMEDABAD: In a single day, Ahmedabad district’s total case tally jumped from 7,171 to 8,144 – an addition of 973 cases. The rise was explained by Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare) as addition of 709 positive cases that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) found from 6,587 tests conducted on vegetable or fruit vendors/grocers in past one week. “The cumulative figure has been added today to Ahmedabad's tally so that there is no discrepancy in data,” she said.

But the explanation did not clarify several facts, pointed out experts. “AMC, which was providing daily list of cases in the category of ‘super spreaders,’ ceased to do so May 10 onwards. Till then, 255 persons were already mentioned in the said category. Then why a cumulative figure of 709 all of a sudden? Why was it not provided to the state health department on daily basis?” asked a public health expert.

Experts also pointed out that from May 9 to 15, AMC had identified 1,877 Covid-19 positive persons in city. If one adds 709 to the tally, which comes to 2586, 27.4% of the total persons tested positive were the vendors or grocers. Senior AMC officials were not available to verify the claim.

Moreover, the 11am report of AMC on Covid-19 scenario mentioned that from May 12 to 15, the civic body collected and processed 1,278 samples out of which 214 were found to be positive. “The figure doesn’t match the details provided by the AMC or state health department, claiming that the persons have been found from 6,587 samples. Moreover, from May 5 to 11, out of 997 tests, 94 were found to be positive. There needs to be clearer explanation on the issue,” said an expert.
