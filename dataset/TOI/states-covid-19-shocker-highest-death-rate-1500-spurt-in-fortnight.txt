Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 shocker: Highest death rate, 1500% spurt in fortnight
2020-04-18
BHOPAL: The alarming rate of spread of Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh, where the number of cases tripled in a week’s time and rocketed to 1,310 by Friday evening, is causing concern across the country.


This is the only state where the fight against the pandemic is on without a health or home minister, and where over 90 health officials are infected with the virus – including four IAS officers. Even the principal secretary of health is among those in hospital with Covid-19.

Madhya Pradesh’s figures for Covid-19 are alarming on every count. With 69 deaths, it is the second highest after Maharashtra and has the highest death rate in the country.

Every 19th coronavirus patient in MP has died. Delhi has more patients than MP, but a much lower death rate – one per 44 patients. As many as 14 deaths were reported in the state in the past 24 hours – perhaps the highest single-day toll of any state. And there have been 29 deaths in less than a week.

From only 86 positive cases on April 1, the state has seen an increase of 1500%. At least 120 of them are health workers, cops or their family members. Cases linked to Tablighi Jamaat number 20 in Bhopal and about 54 in the state. Among the worst hit in MP are frontline fighters – police personnel and health department staff. The ones spearheading the fightback were infected, most of them in a nightmarish week. Several key officials of the health directorate are infected. Nearly half of Bhopal’s corona patients are health workers. The controversy over this added to the complications of fighting coronavirus, with the state government having to come out with repeated statements to claim that none of the officials violated coronavirus protocol.
