2020-04-25
HYDERABAD: A residential community at Nizampet will sing, dance and entertain each other during lockdown on a Youtube channel, exclusively meant for them.


“Performers will be from our residential community but everyone is welcome to watch. We cannot be burdened by the lockdown. We have to have some fun and enjoyment,” said R Rajeshwari Iyer, who conceived the idea along with other residents of Vertex Prime Apartment.

There are 280 flats in the complex and in a first, eight singers will present their programmes on the Vertex Prime official Youtube channel.
