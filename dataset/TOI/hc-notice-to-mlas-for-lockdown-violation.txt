HC notice to MLAs for ‘lockdown violation’
2020-05-06
Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday issued notices to MLAs who allegedly violated lockdown guidelines. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) moved by advocate Para Kishore, the high court asked the director general of police (DGP) to submit the action taken report on the alleged violations of legislators during the lockdown period.

Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Karumanchi Indraneel Babu said some of the ruling party MLAs violated the lockdown prescribed by the Union government under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. He said the lawmakers, who hold responsible positions, violated the norms by organising meetings with huge gatherings, thereby jeopardising people’s health.

He also wanted the MLAs to be booked under relevant laws for their violations. “They have to be tested for Covid-19 as their actions have likely put many others in danger of contracting the virus,” he pleaded.

After listening to the argument of the petitioner, the high court directed the government to submit a report on whether the MLAs have been tested for Covid-19 and directed the DGP to submit the action taken report within seven days. The HC also issued notices to YSRC MLAs B Madhusudhan Reddy, RK Roja, K Sanjeevaiah, Venkata Gouda and V Rajani to submit their replies as they are respondents in the petition.
