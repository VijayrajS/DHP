2020-06-03
MUMBAI: The state on Tuesday recorded 103 fatalities, its second highest after May 29 (116), taking the toll to 2,465. Maharashtra added 2,287 Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 72,300.


Mumbai saw a marginal dip with 1,117 cases, the lowest in six days. The city’s tally stood at 42,216, accounting for 58% of the state’s cases. Deaths, however, continued to be a reason for concern as Tuesday saw 49 fatalities, the third highest rise. The highest number of deaths Mumbai has added on a single day is 54. The city’s toll has reached 1,368 now. 

In a meeting chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray, civic chief I S Chahal informed ministers that the doubling rate of cases in Mumbai has reached 19 days. Till last week, it was around 11-12 days.

Chahal further said that every patient in Mumbai will be given a unique identity number, and it will be mandatory for all laboratories to give a test report within 24 hours.

Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary of the state health department, claimed that the mortality rate in the state has reduced to 3.37% from 7.5% seen in April. Currently, the mortality rate is less than that in a few other states such as Gujarat (6.18%), West Bengal (5.6%) and Madhya Pradesh (4.32%), Vyas said. He added that the ratio of positive patients has also come down to 15.5% from the 18% of the total tested. 

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said data from various hospitals suggest that out of total patients, as many as 75-80% are asymptomatic or mild cases, while 15-18% are moderate. It is only 5-7% patients who have serious illness, particularly those with co-morbid conditions. “Our experience shows that while most patients with mild and moderate disease recover, even serious patients have gone home after beating the illness,” he said. 

Civic authorities, in a statement, cited the examples of three hypertensive male patients aged 72 ,70 and 76 years, who were all admitted in ICU with acute respiratory distress. “All three patients were given oxygen support along with antibiotics, steroid and other standard treatments. All of them fully recovered after (a) few days of hospitalisation,” the statement said.

A senior health care provider, who was admitted with breathlessness, low oxygen levels and uncontrolled diabetes and even required ventilation, has recovered, the civic official said. The doctor was given the injection Tocilizumab in addition to standard medication. He recovered in eight days and was discharged. Around 120 patients have been given the expensive drug in municipal hospitals, of which 108 have recovered. 

Meanwhile, the death of a 38-year-old social worker and RTI activist, Amar Agrawal, has led to shock and grief among Navi Mumbai activists, who have demanded an inquiry into lapses during his admission to the Covid-19 hospital in Vashi. They alleged he was being turned away from hospitals and even had to be driven around in an ambulance for two hours in search of a bed.

Out of the 103 deaths reported on Tuesday, 49 were from Mumbai. The state claimed that of the total, 38 deaths occurred in the last two days, May 31 and June 1, while the rest are from May 1 to 30.

Dharavi on Tuesday reported 25 new cases, taking the total number of patients from the locality to 1,830. The other localities of G North ward like Dadar on Tuesday reported 11 new cases and Mahim 25 cases. The total number of positives reported so far from G North ward has been 2,716, the highest in the city.
