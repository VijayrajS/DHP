GHAZIABAD: A 60-year-old woman who had died hours after her Covid-19 test came back positive — the first such case in Ghaziabad — was cremated at Hindon Bank on Friday. In attendance was her family, health officials and administrative official, all in protective equipment.

The Pratap Vihar resident had been admitted to Yashoda Hospital in a critical state — unconscious, with high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. After being on ventilator support for a day, she died of cardiac arrest on Wednesday. Since she had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in the day, the hospital was provided guidelines on handling the body and the funeral.

She was kept at the mortuary. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation health officer Dr Mithilesh Kumar was nominated as the nodal officer and a nayab tehsildar was appointment a member to oversee the process. The health department provided a funeral van to take the body to the crematorium. Three members of her family were allowed to attend, all in PPE. Her son lit the pyre.

“The family will be quarantined at home instead of a government facility. We’ll also speak to them, establish chain of contact and collected their samples,” chief medical officer NK Gupta said.
