Coronavirus scare: Avoid kissing holy cross, says Cardinal Gracias
2020-03-07
MUMBAI: Archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias, head of the Catholic Church in India, has issued an advisory to prevent the spread of Coronavirus as the community observes the 40-day penance of Lent.


The precautions will be reviewed after Easter on April 12.

The Cardinal issued the communication to all parishes and institutions within the city, with a similar note across India. “There is no sign that (the Coronavirus) has reached its peak, and more deaths are being reported each day,” he said.

Owing to this, he urged churchgoers to greet one another with hands folded in namaste and avoid shaking hands, accept Holy Communion in the hand not mouth, and avoid kissing the Holy Cross at the veneration of the cross on Good Friday. “The blessing with a raised cross would be adequate. Those who wish can come in queue, make reverence with a bow, and go back,” he wrote.

Priests have been urged to purify their hands in a bowl of water or sanitizer before administering holy communion. Holy water stoops must be kept dry.

If there is any sign that an individual within the community is infected, parish priests have been granted leave to temporarily suspend meetings of cells, associations and sodalities.

Cardinal Gracias also issued a prayer for victims, their families, doctors and researchers working to find a vaccine for the disease as well as government authorities at the helm of affairs.
