China eases curbs on virus-hit Hubei after 2-month lockdown
2020-03-25
BEIJING: Chinese authorities said on Tuesday that they will end a two-month lockdown of most of coronavirus-hit Hubei province at midnight, as domestic cases of what has become a pandemic subside. People with a clean bill of health will be allowed to leave, the provincial government said, easing restrictions on movement that were unprecedented in scale. Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, is to remain locked down until April 8. 


 China barred people from leaving or entering Wuhan beginning January 23 in a surprise announcement and expanded that to most of the province in succeeding day s. T he drastic steps came as the coronavirus began spreading to the rest of China and overseas during the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of Chinese travel. Over 2,500 people have died in Wuhan out of 3,270 nationwide. 

T he outbreak has since been brought under control, and Hubei has seen almost no new infections for more than a week. It remained unclear, however, which cities and provinces, including Beijing, the capital, would allow people from Hubei to enter their jurisdiction s. 

 Outside of Hubei, the government says work has restarted on about 90% of major public construction projects across the country. Factories are operating again, though not at full capacity. In Beijing, the zoo and parts of the Great Wall reopened this week, though they required advance reservations to limit the number of visitors . 

 Officials have turned their attention to the threat of the virus entering from abroad.
