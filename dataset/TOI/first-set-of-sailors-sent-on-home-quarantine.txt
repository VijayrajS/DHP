Panaji: The 417 seafarers who arrived in Goa last week on three charter flights were sent on home quarantine on Wednesday after they completed seven days institutional quarantine at hotels in North and South Goa. They all tested negative for Covid-19. They are the first batch of seafarers to be sent on home quarantine following the new protocol. 

The 40-odd seafarers who arrived from South Africa last week and are presently quarantined at a hotel in Patto, Panaji, will complete seven days institutional quarantine on Friday after which they will be stamped and sent into home quarantine. 

The 90-odd crew from Karnika who were to complete 14 days institutional quarantine this Saturday were sent home on Wednesday.
