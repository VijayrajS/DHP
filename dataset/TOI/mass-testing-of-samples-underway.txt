Vadodara: Another round of mass testing will be conducted in Nagarwada-Machchhipith localities by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) after five more persons tested positive from the areas.

 A large-scale mobilisation of health workers was done and police personnel were also deployed with the teams to ensure that the process of collecting samples was smooth. 

VMCâ€™s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that 300 more samples will be collected from the area. He said that the area was contained and movement of people was restricted. 

According to sources, five teams will remain present in the area to collect samples. Ten other health teams will remain present in the area to assist those taking samples and examining people there. Forty police personnel will also remain present during the drive.

Officials said that the need for more sampling was felt as there were some persons with symptoms like upper respiratory tract infections or flu. So far, five persons have tested positive from the 92 samples that were tested as a part of a mass testing drive since Sunday night.
