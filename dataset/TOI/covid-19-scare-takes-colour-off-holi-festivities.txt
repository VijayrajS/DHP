Hubballi: As the fear and anxiety about coronavirus grips the state, Holi celebrations at its commercial capital is likely to be low-key affair.

While a number of schools in the city have asked students to not play Holi this year, many housing societies and residents associations have taken unanimous decision to not play with colours this year. 

In Hubballi, the city known for its Holi celebrations, the festival is a five-day affair. Although people gather and play Holi on the second day after the full moon day, the grand celebration with colours called the ‘Rang Panchami’ is held on the fifth day after full moon day. This year, ‘Rang Panchami’ falls on March 13. 

“Although we have decided to not celebrate with colours this time, we have not restrained anyone. We are also holding a meeting in this regard,” said Subashchandra Akki, one of the residents of Mayuri Garden.

Siddesh Kabadar, president of The Akshay Park Apartment Owners Association said their decision to not play Holi was due to two reasons — Covid-19 infection and forthcoming annual exams of students.

“Again, we have not restrained the society members in any way. The decision was taken unanimously at a meeting,” he said.

Mahesh Tenginkai, organiser of Hubballi Halagi Habba, an event aimed at reviving the traditional flavour of Holi festivities in the city, said: “Following Covid -19 outbreak, we have requested the public to not bring colours to the event. Halagi Habba is an event to celebrate folk traditions,” he said.

The coronavirus scare has left sellers of colours, water guns and water balloons high and dry.“Compared to last year, the sale has dipped. We have not done even 30% of the business that they did previous years,” claimed a vendor in Durgadbail.

Many private luxury hotels in the city have cancelled Holi celebration parties following directions from the administration.
