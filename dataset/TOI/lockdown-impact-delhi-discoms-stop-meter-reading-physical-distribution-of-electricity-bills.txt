NEW DELHI: As the city remains under preventive lockdown, Delhi discoms have stopped meter reading and physical distribution of electricity bills, the distribution companies under BSES said in a statement on Friday.

“On account of the enhanced containment measures and on account of the safety of our consumers and employees, all physical distribution of bills and meter reading is being stopped till further notice. Consumers will be given provisional bills, on the basis of the DERC’s laid down criteria,” a BSES spokesperson said on Friday.

The company, which has two discoms BYPL and BRPL under it, has also stalled some services in the wake of the preventive lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“In support of the government’s measures to contain the spread of the COVID 19, some of our services have been curtailed. We would not be registering requests for new connections till further orders. All existing appointments are also being postponed till further notice,” he said.

In the wake of the lockdown in Delhi, BSES offices are functioning with reduced staff.

“We request consumers to stay safe by practising ‘social distancing’. We are also using the latest digital and online technologies to reach out to our consumers. Consumers can connect to BSES through our digital platforms like BSES website, Mobile App, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, SMS & the Call Centre. This is critical for maintaining social distancing.”
