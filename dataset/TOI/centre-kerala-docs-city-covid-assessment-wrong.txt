‘Centre, Kerala doctor’s Mumbai Covid-19 assessment wrong’
2020-06-07
MUMBAI: The Centre as well as the head of the visiting Kerala team of doctors have got their Covid-19 assessment for Mumbai wrong, said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state task force of doctors set up to advise on the treatment to be followed in the city and Maharashtra. 


Dr S Santhosh, who is leading a team of 150 health workers from Kerala, had told TOI on Friday in the next fortnight, Mumbai will need at least 5,000 ICU beds in clusters of 500 so that manpower and specialists from public and private hospitals can be pooled. Meanwhile, a detailed note on the Kerala doctor’s assessment has been submitted to the state government.

Dr Joshi said the Centre had predicted 50,000 cases in April and six lakh by May 15. “We did not even touch 50,000 by May-end and the peak is already past us,” he said.

While the overall infrastructure for critical care needs to be ramped up, the focus in the war against Covid-19 must be on oxygen and high flow nasal cannula as this can save lives in large numbers, he said, adding the Journal of American Medical Association mentioned that 80% of those who died in New York were on ventilators. 

“We have 6,000 oxygen beds today in the four field hospitals. After Wuhan, Mumbai is the only city to set up this infrastructure. Only 3% of the affected population needs ICU beds and ventilators. Those most vulnerable are above 55 years of age with co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. The deaths we are seeing are because patients come late for treatment. Those with mild to moderate symptoms can be treated at these field hospitals.” 

He said the stigma attached to Covid-19 has resulted in people not seeking help early. Also, there is a reluctance to download Aarogya Setu. The BMC must do more tests and contact-tracing, he added.
