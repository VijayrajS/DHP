Hyderabad: With another case of Covid-19 reported in the city, the state government has gone into overdrive and placed 1,683 people, who arrived in the city on Wednesday, under quarantine. With this, the number of international travellers under home-quarantine has gone up to 70,545. 

The health department has now decided to forms teams consisting of health, civic, police and revenue officials, who along with Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officials, will visit these suspected patients to review their conditions. 

“Those showing symptoms of Covid-19 will be shifted to a hospital and tests will be conducted,” said a senior health official.

Meanwhile, the state government intends to put every international traveller returning to the city under isolation and rapid action teams will check on them at regular intervals. Passengers, who have returned to the city from abroad either directly or after landing at other cities, will have to compulsorily undergo thermal checking as well as fill up self-declaration forms.

The teams set up at the district level are checking on the people kept in home isolation by either calling them up or making video calls to check on them everyday.

 So far, the rapid action teams have picked up atleast 10 suspected patients from their homes and rushed them to Gandhi hospital in the last two week. “In case a passenger reports of having symptoms of Covid-19, our team will take them to Gandhi hospital for check-up. Also people who do not respond to our follow-up calls are being physically checked upon apart from symptomatic patients in home quarantine,” said a senior official from the state health department.
