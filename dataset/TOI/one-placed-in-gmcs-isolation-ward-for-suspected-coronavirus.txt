PANAJI: A traveller who arrived in Goa from China’s Kunshan city a week ago has been placed in the isolation ward of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, for suspected Coronavirus. The patient’s blood and nasal swab samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for testing. 


“All preliminary steps have been taken,” said state health secretary Sanjay Kumar, who chaired the first meeting of the newly-constituted task force on Tuesday. “A sample has been sent for laboratory testing.” 

Director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa said he was under observation as he complained of a sore throat. 

“He is just a traveller,” D’Sa said. “His wife and he arrived from China a week ago. He had visited Kunshan, which is around 750km away from Wuhan.” 

Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, is where the first case of the new Coronavirus was reported last month.

Apart from GMC, the Goa government has made provisions at the Cottage hospital, Chicalim, where a ward of seven beds has been reserved for quarantining suspected Coronavirus cases. “The Cottage hospital has been selected because it’s close to the Dabolim airport,” D’Sa said. In Bambolim, GMC’s isolation ward has 30 beds, and dean Dr S M Bandekar said that an ICU with two beds would be added. 

Meanwhile, Kumar said selected airports that receive direct flights from China have thermal screeners. While he said that Goa currently doesn’t have the device, as a precautionary measure, a request to install one at the Goa international airport has been placed.

Kumar said that the state government has taken preliminary steps and preparatory measures and is in a “comfortable position” to deal with cases that may be detected.
