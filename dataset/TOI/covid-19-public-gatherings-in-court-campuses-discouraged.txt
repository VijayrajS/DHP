Bareilly: After World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) a global pandemic, the district judge, followng an order of the Allahabad high court (HC), has decreed that public gatherings in court campuses must be avoided. 

“Learned counsels may discourage litigants from attending court and absence of learned counsels and parties appearing in person may not entail any adverse orders. It would also be ensured that mediation proceedings are held only in cases that are of urgent nature. All precautionary measures as advised by the government may be strictly adhered to and followed in letter and spirit. Handshake greetings may be avoided,” read the order from the district judge.

Meanwhile, a health department team visited the court campus on Monday. Hand sanitizer has been kept at the entrance of the court and all persons entering the campus have to mandatorily use it.
