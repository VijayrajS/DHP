2020-03-26
BAREILLY: Rampur district magistrate (DM) Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said gram panchayats, nagar panchayats and nagar palikas have been directed to slap fine on people caught unnecessarily loitering on the streets. The fine amount collected will be used in the treatment of Covid-19 cases. DM Singh said those caught violating lockdown will also be booked under relevant sections of the law.


Singh told TOI, “Since many people continue to violate the orders of lockdown and are often caught venturing out, we have decided to slap fines on such violators. Directions have been issued to local government bodies, including gram panchayats and the nagar panchayat, to levy penalties on offenders. The fine amount will be increased in case of repeat offenders. The amount recovered will be utilized for treatment of coronavirus patients.”

“Imposing penalty doesn’t mean that people will come out and get away by paying a fine, they will also be booked under various sections of the relevant laws and further legal action will be initiated. The move is aimed at sending a message to people that irresponsible behavior will not be tolerated and that guidelines need to be strictly followed by all,” the DM added.
