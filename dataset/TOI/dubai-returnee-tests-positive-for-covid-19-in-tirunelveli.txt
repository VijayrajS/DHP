MADURAI: A 43-year-old man from Tirunelveli has tested positive for Covid-19, state health minister C Vijayabaskar said on Sunday. This is the first case to be tested positive in the southern districts of the state.


“The man landed at Madurai airport on March 17 from Dubai. He is said to have travelled to Tirunelveli from Madurai by road. Efforts are on to track his movements before he was hospitalized and identify those he may have been in contact with,” Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, Tirunelveli district collector, told TOI. 

She also confirmed that the patient’s condition was stable. He is in intensive care as he has undergone bypass surgery in the past, sources said.

The man, a native of a village near Radhapuram in Tirunelveli district, works in the Gulf. 

As he grew suspicious of his symptoms, he went to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital on Saturday afternoon and got admitted. Swabs were duly collected and sent for testing. 

On Sunday the test results confirmed Covid-19 infection.
