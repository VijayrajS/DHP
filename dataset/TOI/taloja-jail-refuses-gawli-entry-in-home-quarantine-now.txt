Taloja jail refuses Gawli entry, in home quarantine now
2020-05-26
Nagpur: Underworld don Arun Gawli went into home quarantine after he was refused entry by Taloja Central Jail administration in Navi Mumbai, citing threat of Covid-19 infection. His twice extended parole ended on Sunday, after Nagpur bench of Bombay high court rejected his application for third extension on May 22.

His counsel Mir Nagman Ali said the gangster-cum-politician would be moving another plea before the HC to extend his leave, on May 29. “He’s in a peculiar position where Taloja Jail authorities aren’t ready to accept him citing infection threat, and he can’t come to Nagpur due to travel restrictions,” Ali told TOI.

Popularly known as ‘Daddy’ in his area of Dagdi Chawl, Gawli rushed a letter to divisional commissioner on Sunday stating that about 26 patients were found positive for coronavirus from there. “Considering my age (68), health officials there put me into home quarantine for 14 days from May 20 till June 2,” he mentioned in the letter, a copy of which is with TOI.

The don appealed to the commissioner to extend his leave by another week till May 31, and grant another seven days to facilitate his journey from Mumbai to Nagpur. “I went to Taloja Jail to surrender on Sunday, but superintendent there refused me entry,” he said in the letter.

Police sources said even Gawli wasn’t keen to move to Taloja prison, as many members from his rival gangs like Abu Salem and Ashwin Naik are imprisoned there and chances of clashes can’t be ruled out.

Nagpur jail SP Anupkumar Kumre told TOI they would be informing HC about Gawli’s letter and his inability to travel to the city in view of the lockdown. “Being a high profile prisoner, he was refused entry at Taloja and also due to the fact that he came from a containment zone. Presence of his rivals there may be another reason. We will wait for court’s directives on Tuesday,” he said.
