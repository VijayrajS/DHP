Visakhapatnam: The government is planning to set up a second Covid hospital in Srikakulam keeping in view the increasing number of migrant workers returning or passing through the district from other cities and states. As of now, the district has a 860-bedded hospital to handle Covid cases.

District collector J Nivas recently visited Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) at Balaga to study the feasibility of setting up a 500-bedded facility for Covid patients. The government also recently issued a notification to recruit specialist doctors to work in Covid hospitals in the district. 

“The existing hospital is located in a private area. The new hospital is being planned at RIMS. We expect it to be ready by the end of this week,” said Dr A Hemanth, superintendent of the existing Covid hospital.

Thousands of people from the district migrate to other parts of the country annually in search of livelihood. Many of them are still stuck in cities like Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore due to the lockdown. 

“Till May 25, nearly 12,000 people have returned to Srikakulam. The number is likely to increase now as lockdown norms have been eased, and trains and buses have started running,” said a district administration official.
