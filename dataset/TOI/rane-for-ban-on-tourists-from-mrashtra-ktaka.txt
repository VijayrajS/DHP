Covid-19: Vishwajit Rane for ban on tourists from Maharashtra, Karnataka
2020-03-18
PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Tuesday said he has proposed a ban on entry of tourists through road from the bordering states of Maharashtra and Karnataka for “at least two months”, as a precautionary measure against coronavirus.


The decision, Rane said, needs to be taken in the interest of the state. “A lot of tourists come from the neighbouring states in four-wheelers. It could become a disaster point,” he said, adding CM Pramod Sawant should take a call.

“I have sought advice from Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to see how we can block the borders. We have to at some point seal the borders with the neighbouring states. I have moved a parallel note in this regard to the chief minister,” Rane said.

He said only two entry points could be kept open for vehicles bringing in essential supplies into Goa.

Goa relies on the neighbouring states for the supply of vegetables and grains.

While there are four entry points into Goa from Maharashtra, there are three routes from Karnataka.

Both the states have reported Covid-19 positive cases and one death each, while Goa is yet to report anyone positive, while four suspects have been placed in isolation.

Rane said the state government would also ensure that it keeps track of railway passengers. “Rail travelers will be checked,” he said.

A senior health official said it would be difficult to conduct checks at border points, as they do not have adequate manpower to do the job. “We will be left with fewer doctors to conduct surveillance, if border checking is undertaken,” he said.
