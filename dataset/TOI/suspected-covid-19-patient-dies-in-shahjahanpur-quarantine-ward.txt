Bareilly: A 55-year-old patient who was admitted in the quarantine ward of the Shahjahanpur district hospital on Saturday, died on Sunday before results of his swab sample sent for Covid-19 test could arrive. The resident of Piproula village in Kaanth area was admitted after he exhibited covid symptoms like breathlessness and chest pain. Family members of the deceased have been advised to stay at home. The dead body will be handed over to them once the test report arrives.Chief medical superintendent Dr M P Gangwar told TOI, “The man died few hours after he was admitted to hospital. We are waiting for his test report. The deceased was a farmer and didn’t have any travel history. His condition suggested he was suffering from a pre-existing illness, but there were no test reports available with the family. We have sent his swab sample for testing as a precautionary measure, as he may have contracted the virus from someone.”At Powayan town in the district, a 58-year-old woman was admitted to the quarantine ward, after she appeared for treatment at the community health centre. Claiming the woman has never left the village over the past two months, her family created a ruckus when she was admitted, but their demand that she be allowed to return home was turned down, and the health department is in the process of sending her swab sample for testing.
