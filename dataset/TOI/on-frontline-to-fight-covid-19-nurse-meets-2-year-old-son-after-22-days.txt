AJMER: Yashwanti Garwar met her two-year-old son after 22 days and that too for less than 24 hours before she left to resume her duties as a nurse. Ajmer resident 25-year-old Yashwanti was appointed as a nurse at Pali's Raas Government Hospital three months ago. She moved to Pali with her son Yuvan, but with the spread of Covid-19 cases, she made a trip back to drop Yuvan in her parents’ house.

Worried about her son and longing to see him, she took special permission and went to meet him on April 12. She had a bath, changed her clothes and took Yuvan in her arms. 

“He was so happy to see me and did not leave my lap for a minute. He would wail on not seeing me if I left the room for some time. This made me realise how the kids of parents who are in quarantine must be suffering,” said Yashwanti.

Yashwanti admitted that she got emotional while leaving for work again. “Leave a crying child behind is never easy but it must be done. I know I am only a foot soldier and my role is very limited but it is necessary,” she added. Yashwanti said most of the staff at her hospital were away from their families. “Being alone is a challenge. All of us discuss about reuniting with our families in safe environment after this pandemic ends and frequently talk about our children to keep the mood upbeat. Also, a great mood buster is the gratitude of our patients and their families. That keeps us going,” she said.

Her husband Himanshu works for the railways and expects to be called on duty anytime. “We feel happy but without mother it was sometimes difficult to manage,” said Sushila Devi, Yashwanti's mother. She said her grandson cannot talk on phone but is happy to see his mother on video calls.
