Lockdown woes: Elderly walk 5km to collect pension from post office in Karnataka
2020-04-04
BENGALURU: Braving the scorching sun, around 70 senior citizens from Kanmanike village, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, walked 4-5km to reach the Kumbalgodu post office on Friday morning. They had received information that their pension would be disbursed. With no transport service being available due to the lockdown, the elderly were forced to set out on foot.


“Usually, the money is delivered to their homes by the postal department. This time, they were asked to collect it on their own. The sum — Rs 600-Rs 1,000 — is too valuable for them. With the lockdown, there are no jobs and no money. Thankfully, they got two months’ pension at one go,” explained Prakash, a gram panchayat member.

The pensioners who walked were in their 60s and 70s. Those who were lucky had their relatives drop them to the post office. “On the way, I saw around 25 others. They all would turn expectantly when they heard the sound of a vehicle, hoping they could ask for a lift. It was a sad sight,” said Shivakumar BN, who took his 58-year-old sister Kamalamma to the post office on his bike. 

One elderly woman reportedly hitched a ride in an ambulance that was returning after dropping a discharged patient home.

“The elderly walked with no food or water. Some of them have medical conditions like diabetes and began the journey after taking medicine. By 11am, there were many people at the post office. There was no social distancing, but people were so tired that they just sat down wherever they could find some space,” said Rahul Singh, a factory supervisor, who stays opposite to the post office and has been following the buzz outdoors.

By noon, the veterans returned to their villages, fatigued yet relieved that they had some money to hold on to.
