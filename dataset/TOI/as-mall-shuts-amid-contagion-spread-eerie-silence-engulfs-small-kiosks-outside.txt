Pune: As mall shuts amid coronavirus fears, eerie silence engulfs small kiosks outside
2020-03-20
PUNE: Autorickshaw driver Rafiq Shaikh earned most of his evening fares from the stand outside the southern entrance of the Phoenix Marketcity mall till a week before. However, with the closing of the establishment amid coronavirus scare, all of that has changed.

“This (the Ahmednagar Road entrance) is where I stand till 11pm to ferry passengers. Till recently, there used to be regular customers. But as you can see, it’s completely empty now after the mall shut down amid the coronavirus scare. I hope this situation improves soon,” Shaikh said, while shifting to another location, a few hundred metres ahead at the Vimannagar crossing.

As fears of the spread of the coronavirus caused the state government to shut down shopping malls, people operating small businesses outside such commercial establishments have taken a beating too.

The tea and vada pav stalls as well as paan kiosks, located a few metres away from the entrance of the mall, are now lying closed, with only the bits of plywood and stickers of wallet payment systems being the only remnants of the shacks. Similar is the fate of a slightly more permanent juice parlour just off the pavement near the mall. 

These stalls were heavily patronised by the staff that worked in the mall, besides by the workers at an adjacent construction site. A patron recalled as to how crowded the stalls used to be in the evening till a week back. At 5.30pm on Thursday, all these stalls, however, were eerily empty.

“These stalls have been empty since last Wednesday or Thursday. I visit this stall quite often for tea and vada pav and I know the stall’s owner as well. His business depended on the people from the mall. Once the mall closed, he had no other option but to leave,” Ashok Mandal, a construction worker at a site next to the mall, said.
