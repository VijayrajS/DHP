The DRM said following an advisory issued by the ministry of railways, all possible measures have been taken at railway platforms, ticket booking counters, passenger reservation system (PRS) counters and waiting rooms to prevent spread of coronavirus. “All medical facilities have been made available at the quarantine centre,” he added.

According to DRM, entry of visitors has been stopped at all office buildings of the railways. “Even railway employees have been asked to send messages or get in touch with their branch officers through WhatsApp. The group C and D employees of the Danapur division would be asked to attend their offices on alternate day to reduce congregation of people in the main office buildings, he said.

The railway sanitary employees have been asked to carry out a massive awareness drive against Covid-19 and continue fogging on daily basis in railway colonies located in Danapur, Patna, Jhajha, Buxar, Patna Sahib, Mokama and other places in the division, the DRM said, adding while masks have been distributed in bulk among railway employees, thermal screening process has been started at the Danapur DRM’s office, railway hospital, Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal.
