Wildlife data collection severely hit due to pandemic

Dehradun: The Covid-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown has severely impacted the wildlife data collection this year, with many scientists ruing that the most viable period for the process — summer — has gone waste due to the virus outbreak.

According to researchers involved in wildlife studies, accurate data collection and regular field studies are very important for any kind of analysis in the area. They said that such studies are likely to be impacted this year as they were forced to stay indoors due to the novel coronavirus outbreak during the peak data collection period. They added that the entire process may have to be restructured this year to address the shortcomings.

Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India director Dhananjai Mohan said, “The manual field surveys and spot data collection have been hit due to the lockdown-related movement restrictions amid the pandemic. Summer is the best time for collecting data. However, we have been able to collect data only from camera traps and radio collars this season. Monsoon poses a lot of challenges like poor visibility, difficulty in accessing remote areas and closure of reserves among others.”

Another senior WII researcher Anant Pande, who is also part of an expedition to Antarctica, said, “It was for the first time that our team went to the deeper areas of the continent where several fauna samples are buried under temperature below -50°C. However, we are now stranded at Cape Town in South Africa under hot and humid conditions since April 12. We are worried about the sample degradation and delay in analysis.”

Senior WII officials also said that the release of annual tiger estimates is likely to be impacted too due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
