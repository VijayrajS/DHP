Lockdown revives hunting instincts of Vishwamitri crocs
2020-04-27
Vadodara: Before lockdown closed all restaurants in the city, they used to get sufficient food for survival. It used to be a feast for crocodiles residing in Vishwamitri River as many eateries and mutton shops disposed their waste in or near the river. The reptiles, though, aren’t getting the feed since over a month as all the eateries have been closed. But, interestingly, that hasn’t affected the reptiles much. The reptiles living in densely urban areas have neither migrated to some other parts of the river or ventured out of the water body in search of food.“The reptiles, it seems, are now living on the food available in the river. They might be hunting on fishes. Also, human movement is almost negligible in urban areas due to lockdown and hence small animals including wild boars too are venturing near the river,” said Arvind Pawar who runs Wildlife Rescue Trust.“Crocodiles in Vishwamitri River are also probably hunting small animals. The reptiles are known to adapt to the situation quickly. So they are now learning to feed themselves,” Pawar told TOI. According to the last census done by the forest department in 2016, Vishwamitri River is home to over 260 crocodiles and many of them live in the densely populated areas between Fatehgunj and Sayajigunj. A forest official said, “The reptiles are now probably living on small animals and fishes in the river. And, a crocodile can live for a long time without food. So the reptiles in Vishwamitri River aren’t much affected due to lockdown yet.”
