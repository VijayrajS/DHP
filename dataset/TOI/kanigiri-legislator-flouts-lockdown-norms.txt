2020-04-16
TIRUPATI: YSRC Kanigiri MLA Burra Madhusudhan Yadav on Wednesday tried to enter Andhra Pradesh from Karnataka with 36 other people by defying the lockdown. He was obstructed by the Chittoor district police near Cheekalabailu checkpost, close to the Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border.

Once the police on duty at the checkpost barred the MLA’s five vehicles to pass an altercation broke out. The Kanigiri legislator then met Madanapalle DSP Ravi Manoharachari and demanded that his convoy be allowed to pass. But the DSP refused to budge and told the MLA that the lockdown guidelines cannot be broken or altered for anyone.

However, following instructions from higher-ups, the MLA alone was allowed to pass through the checkpost while his family members and followers were sent back to Bengaluru.

Speaking to TOI, Madanapalle DSP Ravi Manoharachari said the Kanigiri legislator had approached him for permission to let five of his vehicles with 36 members to pass through the Cheekalabailu checkpost. ‘‘We told the MLA that the DGP orders clearly states not to allow any deviations from the lockdown no matter what the contingency. After instructions came from the higher-ups, only the MLA was allowed to pass through the checkpost, while his other family members and followers had to return back to Bengaluru”, the DSP said.
