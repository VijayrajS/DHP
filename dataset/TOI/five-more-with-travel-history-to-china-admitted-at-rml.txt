NEW DELHI: Five persons with history of travel to China were admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital on Wednesday, taking the total admissions for suspected coronavirus infection at the nodal centre to 12. Only persons with symptoms of the viral infection, including fever and cough, are being admitted to the hospital. The rest are being quarantined at other facilities like isolation units set up by the Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and even homes, officials said.


“The test samples of all admitted persons have been sent to National Centre for Disease Control and National Institute of Virology, and reports are awaited,” said an official.

Among those admitted to RML hospital are two 23-year-old men and a woman who returned from China last week.

Five evacuees, who were being quarantined at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) facility, were shifted to Safdarjung hospital on Tuesday. “Among those shifted are three men and two women. The five have been shifted as a precautionary measure after they showed basic symptoms like cough and sneezing. Some had a medical history,” said a doctor.

A total of 406 people have been quarantined at the ITBP facility in Delhi’s Chhawla area since the last week after they were brought in two batches from Wuhan onboard separate Air India flights.
