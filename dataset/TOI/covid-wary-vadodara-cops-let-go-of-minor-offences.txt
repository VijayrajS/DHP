Covid-wary Vadodara cops let go of minor offences
2020-06-02
Vadodara: Wary of the Covid-19 infection, Vadodara police have been avoiding arrests of offenders booked for non-serious crimes in the city. Except the offences that are life threatening, the police are simply booking the accused and conducting investigations in the case. The move came after some of the accused booked for two different rioting cases were tested positive in last one month. 

The police teams involved in the arrests had to be quarantined. A police sub-inspector posted at Karelibaug had also tested positive for Covid-19 some days ago. 

“There is risk of Covid-19 infection but the cops must do their duty and act in criminal cases. So we have decided to not make arrests in cases that are not life threatening. In offences that are not serious, we file FIR and conduct the routine investigations,” said Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner. 

“The arrests will be made after the threat of Covid-19 reduces. Safety of the policemen and citizens is a must for us,” Gahlaut added. 

The police is making arrests only in rioting, attempt to murder, murder or assault cases. Before lockdown was announced, about 70 to 80 persons were arrested daily in different criminal cases but the number is now down to around a dozen men every day. 

“While making arrests, the cops come in close contact with the accused who may be infected with Covid-19. So I have asked the police to take all the precautions, wear PPE kit whenever necessary and use face masks and gloves,” Gahlaut told TOI. The cops are cautious while making arrests as they don’t want to get infected or remain quarantined for weeks. 

The police have almost stopped detaining vehicles of people who move out of their homes during the lockdown hours. In the earlier weeks of lockdown, about 500 to 600 vehicles were detained everyday but now the number is down to 10 vehicles daily.
