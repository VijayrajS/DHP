NAGAPATTINAM: Ten foreign Tablighi Jamaat missionaries and their two guides were arrested on April 9 from a madrassa in Needur village in Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district on charges of violating the Covid-19 lockdown norms and the Foreigners Act. The police, after conducting an initial investigation, told reporters, “They did not attend the TJ conference in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. We are now waiting for their swab sample test results.”


They were produced before the Mayiladuthurai judicial magistrate at his house on the same day, who remanded them in 15 days of judicial custody.
