HYDERABAD: Authorities battling the Covid-19 spread tightened vigil across the city after two persons died and 51 tested positive for the virus. Jiaguda area has become the hotbed for new cases in the city with 36 from the area testing positive. Fourteen others among the new cases turned out to be migrant labourers.


The total number of cases in state stood at 1,326 and the toll was 32.

“So far, 25 migrant labourers have reported positive recently. So chief minister KCR has instructed the department to make sure all the asymptomatic migrant labourers coming into the state should be home quarantined or kept in government quarantine,” medical and health department director Dr Srinivas Rao said.

In Hyderabad, Jiaguda continued to remain a major concern for officials as the area reported about 40 cases even on Monday, said an official.

He said rumours of Rs 1,500 being deposited for ration card holders in banks led to chaos and hundreds gathered before banks, which possibly led to the spread of the virus.

“Another reason for the local spread was a popular butcher shop owner testing positive,” the official added.

According to highly placed sources, there are about 600 primary contacts for the new cases from these areas. They were all quarantined and authorities are in search for their secondary contacts also.

A 65-year-old patient admitted with high diabetes and hypertension died at the Gandhi hospital on Monday and at least six patients were admitted in the hospital

The health department undertook a fever survey in 6,570 households in four containment zones of Sharada Nagar, Thirumalagiri Nagar, JB colony, Bhagya Nagar Colony and Vijayapuri Colony.

In one case, officials had to take help of the police to persuade a 27-year-old woman suspect to give her samples.

Twenty-one people were discharged on Tuesday, taking the total tally of recovered people to 822.
