Coimbatore: The district is anxiously waiting for the announcement on lockdown relaxations on Monday.With the district as a Covid-19 red zone, people are unsure how much relaxation it would be given. Police officials said as on Sunday they had not made any anticipatory preparations. They could decide on increasing the number of personnel only based on the chief minster’s announcement. Coimbatore superintendent of police Sujit Kumar said as the district was under red zone, they can’t deicide anything by themselves. “Based on the government’s announcement and instructions from higher officials, we would proceed,” he said.The health department, meanwhile might have to put in extra work to screen people, in case of a relaxation, and following which if people crowd at public spaces. “Based on the manpower, we might have to screen people’s temperature with thermal scanners at public spaces,” said a district administration official. However, the main function of health officials would remain unchanged – contact tracing, testing and treatment, the official said. Relaxation would be beneficial in one aspect, said a source, as many of the positive cases in the district were now completely asymptomatic. “If there is a relaxation in the lockdown strictures, and subsequent movement of people, we can understand whether people are resistant or what other phenomenon is under work,” said the source.Industrialists too said they would decide on starting operations only after assessing the state’s announcement on Monday. J James, district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (TACT), said if there is a relaxation for industries, those industrial units which have raw materials stocked-up and which have existing orders, could work. “Some industries would have stopped on-going work. Such industries could finish pending jobs,” he said. Industries were also concerned about workers’ safety, said R Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia). “After the state announces the guidelines, we have to see whether the conditions are feasible to operate. If in case any worker is infected, we would inform the health department and we seek that the health department should manage the expenses and take care of the worker,” he said. “We are also not clear what should industries in containment zones do. We are waiting for the state’s announcement,” he added.
