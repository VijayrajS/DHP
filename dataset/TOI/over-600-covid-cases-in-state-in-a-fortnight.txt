PATNA: The number of Covid-19 positive cases in state has shot up sharply since migrant workers started coming back by special trains from different parts of the country on May 2. The Covid positive figures crossed 1,000-mark on Friday.

While Bihar recorded its first three coronavirus cases on March 22 (all with foreign travel history), the figure crossed 50 on April 9 and 100 on April 20. The number of positive cases doubled to 200 on April 24 and to 400 on April 29. Thereafter, their numbers surged to 800 within 13 days, on May 12 and crossed the 1000-mark on Friday. 

As per the information shared by state health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar, out of 999 positive cases reported till 10am on Friday, 416 were migrants, who constitute 41.6% of the total cases in state. Sanjay said 358 of them have been tested between May 5 and 14. The first Shramik special train reached Bihar on May 2. Over 2.35 lakh migrants and students have reached the state by 197 trains so far. 

The highest number of 130 Covid-19 positive cases in Bihar were reported on May 12. Earlier, 85 had tested positive on May 10 and 74 on May 13. After the migrants’ inflow increased, the state government started random testing from May 8 with focus on migrants coming from red zones and those vulnerable to the virus. Maximum 115 positive cases among the migrants have come from New Delhi, followed by 97 from Gujarat.

Sanjay said the health department was analysing the data and all migrants returning to the state were being sent to institutional quarantine centres. Cases reported initially were mainly of foreign returnees. Then Bihar government started testing all persons returning from abroad before lockdown. Till mid-April, over 20 positive cases had history of foreign visits. Three of them had transmitted the virus to at least 50 others.

State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ragini Mishra said they have got the list of 36 Bihar natives, who recently came back to India. “They are being quarantined in the city where their flight lands. For example, few have been quarantined in Lucknow and Gaya. They can either go for paid quarantine in hotels or stay in government’s centre,” she said.
