Telangana: Wildlife sightings bring cheer amid coronavirus gloom
2020-03-29
HYDERABAD: Thanks to the lockdown, wild animals that were rarely spotted have started comig back in towns and urban areas in the last few days.


In one such instance (on Thursday morning), four Asian palm civets were spotted in a human habitation at Siddipet’s Dubbaka mandal. Similarly, in Kamareddy district, villagers spotted a rusty-spotted cat, one of the smallest wild cat species, and two sloth bears in Kagaznagar town in Asifabad-Kumaram Bheem district.

“Civets are nocturnal animals and they usually can’t be seen because they don’t come out during day time at all. It is difficult to spot these animals even if we go in the forests because they are solitary animals. They usually sleep on tall trees during the day to avoid predators and actively forage at night,” said senior forest department official A Shankaran.

 He said a gaur calf was sighted in one of the villages a couple of days ago. “Gaurs are wild bovine species that usually live in small herds and do not venture out of the forest,” said Shankaran. Forest officials recorded an increase in wild animals crossing roads in Amrabad mandal. They attributed the wildlife sightings to lack of vehicles plying on the roads. 

“The lockdown is a reminder that animals have always lived in areas that we now call cities. Due to lockdown, people movement is restricted and perhaps animals are getting cues to get active much earlier and even in daytime. Sightings might increase but in any case translocation of animals during this time should not be done and it cannot be termed as rescue but forced displacement,” said Imran Siddiqui, a biologist afounder of city-based Hyderabad Tiger Conservation Society.
