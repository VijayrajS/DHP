2020-04-09
Prayagraj: Aiming to keep novel coronavirus spread under control by taking special care of high-risk patients, the Union health ministry has asked all states and Union territories to earmark at least one haemodialysis facility in each district a preparatory fixed-point dialysis unit. The facility should be equipped with adequate number of dialysis machines, support equipment and trained staff.

In an advisory ‘Guidelines for Dialysis of Covid-19 patients’, the ministry has said district administrations have to allow easy movement of such patients, accompanied by one attendant, to the dialysis facility.

Prof. Arvind Gupta, head of nephrology department, MLN Medical College, Prayagraj, said the ministry has specified that state transport system should be arranged for those patients who do not have private vehicles and the hospital papers be treated as pass for commuting.

“Patient suffering with chronic kidney disease (stage-5) on dialysis are vulnerable because of existing co-morbidities, repeated unavoidable exposure to hospital environment and immune-suppressed state. These patients are more prone to acquire infection as compared to general population,” he added. The dialysis units should prominently place signboard in local language, Hindi and English telling patients to report any fever, coughing or breathing problem.
