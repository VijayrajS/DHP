As Covid-19 fans communal mistrust, vendors team up to keep business going in Muzaffarnagar
2020-05-23
Muzaffarnagar: With the coronavirus outbreak leading to prejudices along religious lines in India, fruit and vegetable vendors in Muzaffarnagar — which saw deadly riots in 2013 — were finding it hard to do business without their identity being questioned. That’s when two of them — Sanjay Kumar and Mansoor Ahmed — came up with a solution. They pooled in money to buy the items and started visiting colonies together. “Now we have representation from both communities. I sell to Hindu households and Ahmed to Muslim homes. We divide the profits at the end of the day,” Kumar, 30, told TOI.While the duo may be making more money than earlier, they agree that the circumstances behind their joint enterprise are saddening. Kumar confesses that many times they have been asked to show their identity cards by customers who wanted to ascertain their identity before buying from them.Soon after the Tablighi Jamaat meet in Delhi was identified as a Covid-19 cluster, Ahmed, 31, said he lost many of his long-term customers. “There were random allegations that members of my community were deliberately trying to spread the virus. It was very upsetting,” he said.Notably, on April 8, Meerut police had booked two people for circulating a video on WhatsApp that urged people to stop entry of vendors from minority community as they were “spreading coronavirus”.After teaming up, the duo is now earning a net profit of Rs 400 daily from increased sales. Talking about their partnership, Ahmed said, “We are just trying to make a living for us and our families. Kumar was an acquaintance but now he is a friend.”
