BIJNOR: Cane lndustry in UP is worried these days over the shortage of lime. It gets lime from Bhilwara in Rajasthan. Lime is a key ingredient for processing cane juice into sugar.


Bhilwara is the worst coronavirus-hit district in Rajasthan. Migrant workforce has left the district, resulting in shutting down of quarries there. Hence, supply of lime to UP mills has virtually stopped.

DM of Bijnor Ramakant Pandey has sent an SOS to his Rajasthan counterpart to regulate supply. 

Six sugar mills in Bijnor are on the verge of stopping operations due to the shortage of lime.

Besides, 250 lakh tons of ripe cane crop is yet to be harvested.

Bijnor district cane officer Yashpal Singh said, "There are nine sugar mills in Bijnor district. Out of these, six mills have little stock of lime, Mills are facing a lot of problems to procure lime from Rajasthan because of the nationwide lockdown."

In his letter, Bijnor DM Pandey has also said the government has allowed free movement of vehicles transporting lime during the lockdown.

Cane officer Singh said, "Six mills of Bijnor district require around 15,000 quintals of lime from Rajasthan's lime units.

"We are trying our best to sort out problems of the sugar mills. I hope the mills will procure raw material in time." he added..

Sources said if the mills fail to get lime from Rajasthan, they will have to stop operations, which will add to the hardships of cane farmers .
