Covid-19: 13 BMC teams to collect samples
2020-04-19
BHUBANESWAR: A day after the state government decided to test thousands of people here for Covid-19, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday formed 13 teams comprising sanitary inspectors, ward officers, health workers and teachers to collect samples.

A total of 750 samples were collected in the first shift from 8 am to 11 am. The second shift was held from 4 pm to 6 pm, officials said.

The teams have opened mobile sample collection centres across the city and will keep moving the centres every day. Each team comprises three health workers, two teachers and one sanitary worker. While the health workers are the ones doing the actual sample collecting, the teachers attached to the teams look after documenting each sample collected in a prescribed format. The sanitary workers are ensuring that the centre is sanitized both before and after the collection of sample.

BMC deputy commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury said the teams would move location every day to cover a large portion of the city. “From Saturday, we started rapid antibody tests. If someone tests positive, he or she will undergo the more definitive RT-PCR test for confirmation,” he said.

The Centre has sent 6,000 rapid test kits to the state.
