MADURAI: The Madurai judicial magistrate (JM) V court granted bail to a man who was arrested and remanded in judicial custody by the Madurai city police after it was informed that he had tested positive for Covid-19. The court cited that the man needed proper medical care and keeping him under custody would cause the spread of the virus.

According to the FIR, the petitioner along with seven other men assaulted M Praveenkumar and four others due to previous enmity near Sandhanamariamman temple at Thideer Nagar in Madurai on May 18. 

Based on Praveenkumarâ€™s complaint, the Thideer Nagar police had registered a case against the petitioner and seven others under Sections 147, 148, 341, 294(b), 323, 506(ii) of the IPC. 

Afterwards, the petitioner moved court seeking bail and the case was heard recently. His counsel submitted that the petitioner had tested positive for Covid-19, and should be granted bail. Hearing the plea, judicial magistrate E Pravin Kumar said the petitioner needed proper medical care and keeping him under custody might cause the spread of the infection. 

The magistrate said keeping the larger interest of the society in mind, the court granted bail to the accused. The magistrate said the superintendent of Theni district prison shall release the accused on executing a bond for Rs 10,000.
