Vadodara: Many may have money, but not the heart to part with it even during a tragedy like Covid-19. But Lalita Patel, an octogenarian pensioner, did not even blink before donating Rs2,21,551 to Vadodara mayor’s fund for Covid-19.Many have been donating to mayor’s fund since Covid-19 raised its head in the city. Learning about this, Lalita Patel, a retired government teacher, made up her mind to donate money for the cause. She stays in Chhani Jakatnaka area of the city along with her sister.“I was a government schoolteacher and retired 20 years ago. My needs are meagre. I always walked to school right till my retirement when I was posted at Bakrol and stayed at Vallabh Vidyanagar,” said Patel.Patel said that she decided to stay single and had dedicated her life to children at the schools where she taught. “My sister is a widow and has no children. We stay together,” she said.Looking to provide aid, Patel contacted an employee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) staying in the apartment where she too stays. “He directed us and arranged for me to hand over the cheque to the mayor,” she said.Patel said that she and her sister never faced difficulties during the lockdown. “We get whatever we need from the shops nearby. We need little to survive on and are independent. We walk to the shops nearby and get whatever we need,” she said.
