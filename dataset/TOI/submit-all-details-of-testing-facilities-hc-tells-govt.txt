2020-04-22
Nagpur: Expressing concern over government’s handling of coronavirus outbreak in Vidarbha, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court asked for all details regarding testing facilities in the region.“Place on record the data of date-wise total testing kits supplied and number of samples tested and pending till date at all testing facilities available with the government in Nagpur and Akola. This data should be made available in any case by Wednesday so that the HC will be in a position to deal with it on Thursday,” Justice Nitin Sambre said.While hearing a plea by CH Sharma and others regarding inadequate facilities at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), where Anup Gilda is appointed as amicus curiae, the HC adjourned hearing till Thursday. It was already clubbed with another PIL (No10/2020) by businessman Subhash Zanwar through counsel Ram Heda.The court further pulled up the government for hiding information about starting Covid-19 testing facility at Maharashtra Animal and Fisheries University (MAFSU).“The fact of making available facility and availability of testing Kits at MAFSU appears to be suppressed for which the nodal officer and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCHs) dean, who are authorized by the government in this matter, are unable to give any explanation. Upon assurance given by the government pleader, by way of an opportunity, the court is inclined to grant last chance to explain the same,” the judge said.Earlier, appearing for intervener, counsel PD Sharma pointed out that essential commodities were not being supplied to fair price shop owners to enable ration card holders to get benefit. “Though schemes have been announced for distribution of foodgrains, difficulties are being faced as essential commodities not being supplied to small shop owners,” he said. He also pointed out that the doctors and other medical staff were discharging their duties without preventive and protective equipment.Heda contended the district administration ought to be directed to take steps for identifying persons who have reported their travel history in the light of the Epidemic Act, 1879, as well as the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
