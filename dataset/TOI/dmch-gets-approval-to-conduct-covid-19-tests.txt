Ludhiana: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given a green signal to the department of microbiology of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Tagore Nagar, Civil Lines, to conduct Covid-19 tests. It is the first private laboratory in the state to get ICMR’s nod. At present, the state has three government laboratories reporting to ICMR: Government Medical College, Amritsar; Government Medical College, Patiala; and Guru Gobind Singh Medical University, Faridkot.The ICMR had invited applications from private medical colleges for establishing a Covid-19 testing facility. DMCH had applied for it the previous week. For private medical colleges, it is essential to submit a copy of the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration (NABL) certificate.DMCH secretary Prem Gupta said, “With this, we will be able to test samples of suspected Covid-19 cases. We have written to the health department to provide us kits, so that we can start testing within a day.” DMCH has a BSL-2 level laboratory, including a molecular biology setup for virological diagnosis.“We have sufficient staff, including a medical microbiologist with work experience in molecular virology and four to six technicians who have relevant work experience in molecular virology. The staff has a good understanding of laboratory biosafety and biosecurity. They are trained in handling respiratory samples for viral diagnosis, RNA extraction and real-time PCR. They also have experience of work in virology and handling clinical specimens, especially respiratory samples,” Gupta added.DMCH has an institutional policy on biomedical waste management and arrangements for its segregation and disposal, he said. Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said, “Soon, testing kits will be provided to the hospital. The price will be as per the Supreme Court orders and the government guidelines. All the samples will be routed through civil surgeon’s office.”
