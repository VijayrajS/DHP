We have to live with coronavirus: HC
2020-05-21
AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has directed the special court to take a decision on bail application of an accused arrested for offences under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Atrocities Act. 


On April 18, the special court had given direction to place the matter for consideration only after the lockdown is lifted.

Citing a Supreme Court order, justice TV Nalawade observed: “This court holds that the courts now need to decide on all the proceedings as we have to live with coronavirus and the working of the courts cannot be stopped directly or indirectly.”

Earlier, the petitioner had approached the court of special judge with his bail application in March 2020, who ordered the application to be placed for consideration only after the lockdown was over. The special judge had passed this order on the basis of an order passed by a single judge at Principal Seat of the Bombay high court on April 3.

Following this order, the accused’s brother approached the high court through lawyer Nilesh Ghanekar.

Justice Nalawade, while allowing the petition, observed: “When the accused is behind bars, he has right of early trial of his case. The right to get early decision on his bail application is also a part of the right given under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In view of the aforesaid circumstances, it cannot be said now that such category of matters cannot be called as the matters needing urgent attention.’’

He added, “Lockdown was imposed in the month of March 2020 and it still continues. Initially, the courts were holding that the applications filed for relief of bail cannot be treated as from the category of extreme urgent matters. The lock down is continuing and the period of around two months will be completed shortly. It is not certain when the lockdown will come to an end.’’
