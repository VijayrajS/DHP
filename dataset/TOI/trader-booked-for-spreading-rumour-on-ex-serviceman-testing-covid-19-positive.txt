PUNE: A small-time trader was booked on Friday for spreading rumour that an ex-serviceman had tested positive for coronavirus at Sai Vihar society at Kalepadal around 7.30am.


The Wanowrie police said the ex-serviceman, Uttamrao Boyne (48), an ambulance driver at present, and his wife were standing outside their home when the former complained of hypertension and blood sugar-level drop. His wife rushed him to a hospital for treatment.

The trader saw the couple leaving for hospital and spread the rumour that Uttamrao tested positive for coronavirus, the police said. Sub-inspector Sandeep Warpade from the Wanowrie police said, “The couple on reaching home learnt from the neighbours that the trader had spread the false news that Uttamrao had tested Covid-19 positive.”

He said, “The angry couple confronted the suspect and sought reasons for defaming them over the issue. The suspect, in no mood to listen, picked up a dispute and hurled abuses at them.”

The sub-inspector said, “After the dispute between the two parties heat up, the suspect picked up a stone for hitting Uttamrao. He missed the target and the stone hit Uttamrao’s wife on her head. The suspect then pushed her aside and took to heels.” 

Uttamrao’s wife later lodged an FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

“We have served a notice under Section 141 (1) [3] of the Criminal Procedure Code on the businessman, asking him to join in the investigation,” he added.
