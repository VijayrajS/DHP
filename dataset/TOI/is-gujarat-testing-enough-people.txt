AHMEDABAD: For the state of 6.5 crore, Gujarat has tested just 1,998 persons for the Covid-19 virus. A few other Indian states have tested more. Maharashtra, which has the highest number of positive cases and deaths in the country, tested around 6,500 samples till April 3 to identify 335 cases.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health and family welfare), defended the state strategy, saying that the department is following national guidelines. “Every state and country has its own method. For example, South Korea went for mass testing in ATM-like booths,” she said. 

Current testing strategy by ICMR, updated on March 20, says that all symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days, all symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases, all symptomatic healthcare workers, all hospitalized patients with SARI and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between 5-14 days of coming into contact.

Ravi said that in regions recording high number of cases like Ahmedabad, they are considering rapid sampling and random sampling methods.
