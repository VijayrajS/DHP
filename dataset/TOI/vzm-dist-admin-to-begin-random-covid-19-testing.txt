2020-04-18
Visakhapatnam: District officials have started conducting Covid-19 screening tests in Vizianagaram town, Parvathipuram and Salur.

The officials pointed that this was made possible mainly because of the arrival of 1,400 screening kits, which will help them conduct ramdom tests and also enable preview results almost instantaneously (within an hour).

“The basis for conducting the tests is the True NAT method and we have trained dentists and lab technicians to conduct them in a professional manner,” said district collector M Hari Jawahar Lal. 

When asked if random testing meant testing even those without symptoms, the collector said, “ Only those who show symptoms and ones who come in contact with Covid-19 patients will be tested.”

The collector further said the administration will intensify door-to-door survey and surveillance and urged the staff to ensure that proper survey is done to ensure authentic database.

Meanwhile, the district administration noted that once screening is done, if preliminary reports say that somebody has tested positive, the sample will be sent for re-testing immediately.
