2020-05-09
Kolkata: A Bengal BJP delegation led by party state president Dilip Ghosh knocked on the doors of Raj Bhavan on Friday to draw the West Bengal governor’s attention to the state government’s “double standards” in Covid-19 management.

After meeting the governor, Ghosh pointed to the “inhuman face” of the state government that is paying only “lip service” to bring back migrant workers, patients and pilgrims stranded outside Bengal. “We have been getting frantic calls from Bengal patients stuck in Vellore and pilgrims who had been to Haridwar and Vrindavan and thousands of migrant workers to help them return home. The CM has arranged for a special train from Ajmer to Kolkata, but has done nothing to bring back those caught in Haridwar or Vrindavan,” he said. 

Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee accused BJP of induling in “corona politics”. “BJP is into corona politics from Day 1, sending out messages and insinuations that do not go well with the situation we are in. This is not the time to do politics. We want all parties to come together and fight the virus along with the state government,” he said.
