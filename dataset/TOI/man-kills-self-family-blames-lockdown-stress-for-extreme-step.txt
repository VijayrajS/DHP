Bareilly: A 32-year-old labourer, who was said to be depressed due to the Covid-19 lockdown, committed suicide by hanging himself at his house in Hafizganj area in Nawabganj tehsil of Bareilly district on Friday. His wife said that there was nothing to eat at home and all their savings had dried up. 

However, police claimed that the victim was provided food items on April 7 after he rang up Dial 112 helpline and that he committed suicide because he was stressed due to a pending court case where he was a co-accused.

On Thursday night, Mujahid went to sleep with his family and sometime during midnight, he hanged himself from the ceiling. His family informed the police on Friday morning.

His wife, Shaheen, told the police that Mujahid was upset because they didn’t have any savings left and no food for their children. They had not paid the rent of the house for two months, she said.

Hafizganj SHO Mahendra Singh told TOI, “We had provided 10 kilograms of wheat and other food items to the family on April 7. We spoke with local residents and came to know that Mujahid was upset because of a murder case in which he was a co-accused.”

Bareilly district magistrate Nithish Kumar said, “We are ensuring with the support of police that food items are provided to every person in need. We will look into this case.”
