Pune citizens cancel or postpone routine check-ups amid coronavirus worries

PUNE: Shruti Mundada was to visit her doctor for a post-surgery check-up recently, but she postponed the appointment on the advise of her family members, following the huge coronavirus scare.


Like Mundada, many Puneites are reluctant to visit hospitals even for routine health check-ups for fear of contracting Covid-19. It is not just about hospitals, people are wary of visiting crowded places in the wake of the contagion spread, experts said.

Wanowrie resident Rajesh Bhat said he was to take his mother for a follow-up at her diabetologist in a nearby hospital. “However, we called up the doctor and postponed the appointment to April to ensure that my mother is not exposed to the unhealthy atmosphere prevailing in the city,” Bhat said.

Resultantly, healthcare facilities like Ruby Hall Clinic have reported a drop in visitors’ footfall.

When asked about the fear and resultant drop in patient visits, Sanjay Patil, president of the Indian Medical Association, Pune, said, “There is definitely less footfall at hospitals and even in clinics. However, the rush is quite a bit when it comes to paediatricians, who are being visited by more people for consultation on seasonal viral fever.”

He said this was happening due to the prevailing fear of Covid-19 among residents. 

“We have planned surgeries but even those are being postponed because of coronavirus fear. People wish to self-quarantine and not involve in group activities. They are also avoiding unnecessary travel even within the city,” Patil added.

Chief executive officer of Ruby Hall Clinic Bomi Bhote said, “There is almost a 20% drop in footfall at our hospital in the wake of the coronavirus fears.”

Senior surgeon at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital Dhananjay Kelkar said, “We are full as always. There is no drop as of now and the same is in the OPD section.”
