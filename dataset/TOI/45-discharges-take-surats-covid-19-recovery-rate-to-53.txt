Surat: About 45 Covid-19 patients were discharged in the city on Saturday. This took the total number of discharged patients to 445 and recovery rate to 53 per cent in the city, sources said. 

Municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said more number of Covid-19 patients were recovering from the infection now. “Twelve patients were discharged from Covid Care Centre (Samras Hostel) and 33 from New Civil Hospital (NCH). This is an encouraging sign,” Pani said.

“Now, Surat city’s recovery rate is about 53% which is very good. A lot of people want to know how the recovery rate in Surat has gone up. I will say it is primarily due to early identification of cases. Since beginning, our focus has been on testing, tracking and treating. We are pro-actively finding out cases of influenza like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) from private clinics, primary health centres and community health centres in the city. These cases are tracked and monitored by our war room,” the municipal commissioner said.

Limbayat zone in city continues to remain a hotspot with detection of seven more Covid-19 cases. Limbayat zone has recorded highest number of 333 Covid-19 cases followed by Central zone with 124. 

“Our focus is on Limbayat zone, Central zone and Varachha (A) zone as more Covid-19 cases have been reported from here. About 977 health teams are conducting door-to-door surveillance in the city. They have covered over 98,000 houses in the city until Saturday,’’ Pani said.
