KOTTAYAM: A fruit shop in the market was closed by health department authorities on Wednesday after it was found that a truck driver from Tamil Nadu, who had primary contact with a Covid-positive person, had mingled with as many as 17 people in the market, including the fruit shop owner and load workers.

 The truck carrying water melons from Tindivanam in Tamil Nadu had reached Kottayam on Tuesday.

The samples of all those who had come into contact with the driver have been sent for lab tests and all of them have been sent to home quarantine. Health workers said none among them have symptoms of Covid-19. The results will be available on Friday. The health officials swung into action after receiving information that a person, who travelled in the same truck, and who got down in Palakkad, later tested positive for Covid-19 and was sent into isolation.

Another person who was in the truck had left for Palakkad the same day. Health officials tracked down the person who left for Palakkad at Ernakulam on the wee hours of Wednesday and he was taken to the Ernakulam General Hospital where his samples were taken. 

The man was later shifted to the isolation ward of Palakkad General Hospital in an ambulance. So far, only three Covid-19 cases were reported in Kottayam and all three have recovered. The district was classified as a Green Zone for the Covid-19 outbreak and authorities have been easing restricitons in the region.
