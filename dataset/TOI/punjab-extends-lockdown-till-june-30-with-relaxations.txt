CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday announced a four-week extension of the lockdown in Punjab, till June 30, with certain more relaxations, subject to the new guidelines issued by the Centre. The move is in line with the Centre's decision to extend the national lockdown beyond May 31. 


 Though experts have advised against opening of the hospitality industry and malls, the chief minister said the state would take into account the Centre's guidelines for Lockdown 5.0. 

 Amarinder announced his decision after an on-ground assessment of the Covid-19 situation through a video conference with health experts along with top officials and Cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa.

Amarinder later said during his weekly Facebook Live session that the threat of Covid-19 was not over yet, and if necessary, he would continue to take tough measures to save the lives of Punjabis. Underlining the need to continue to exercise extreme caution, he lauded the citizens for following all health norms to help the state government in controlling the pandemic spread to a great extent.

He said extension of the lockdown in Punjab would be conditional to strict adherence to Covid safety protocols, including physical distancing and wearing of masks. He also ordered distribution of free masks to the poor as part of ration kids to the needy and poor, who could not afford to purchase them. More than Rs 1 crore collected so far in fine from the offenders, he added.

Amarinder said 85% of the state’s industry had already started operations with 65% of labour engaged in it. The government was facilitating many multinational IT firms, including Quark, to set base in Mohali and many more would come to Punjab as the situation improves, he said in reply to another query.
