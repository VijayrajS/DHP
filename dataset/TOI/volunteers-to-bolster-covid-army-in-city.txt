2020-04-30
Vadodara: With fears of Covid-19 cases multiplying in the coming months, the administration has started ensuring it has adequate workforce to handle the situation. The officials are looking to enlist volunteers for the Covid Army to manage any possible escalation in cases in the future.

The top brass of various defence establishments in the city held a meeting with the civil administration led by officer on special duty (OSD) for Covid-19 Dr Vinod Rao on Wednesday. EME School Commander major general MJS Syali, air commodore Kuttappa from the Air Force Station and Brigadier Sanjog Negi from Indian Army remained present in meeting at the GEB guest house.

Rao said the meeting discussed how a dedicated Covid care centre for defence personnel could be set up in Vadodara and various resources available with EME, Army and Air Force Stations in the city can be used in coming days.

The possibility of defence personnel volunteering in the Covid Army if cases escalate during June-July was also discussed. Rao said that detailed planning had been started and would be finalized in the coming days. Necessary permissions to use the services of the defence personnel would also be obtained.

Four positive cases were reported in the EME School last week. The civil administration assisted with doctors, medicine and sanitization. Many persons in EME are in self quarantine since then. The possibility of distributing homoeopathic and ayurvedic medicines helping in flu-like diseases in cantonment areas was also discussed. 

Various teachers associations in the city also held a meeting and expressed their keenness on joining the Covid Army voluntarily. Arrangements for providing training to the teachers were also being made. Master trainers would first be trained followed by training for all teachers who are willing to join the Covid Army.
