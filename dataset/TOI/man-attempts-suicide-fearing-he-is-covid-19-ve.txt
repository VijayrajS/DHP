PITHORAGARH: A 45-year-old man slit his own throat in Gangolihat town of Pithoragarh district in a bid to commit suicide fearing that he is coronavirus-infected. The man is undergoing treatment in a health facility at Haldwani at present.


The man, who works at the district livestock office in Champawat, had come back to his home in Gangolihat with his family before the lockdown. Sources said that he was suffering from throat infection since the past few days and feared that he might have contracted the Covid-19 infection. “On Tuesday, the manlocked himself in his room and slit his own throat. Hearing noise from the room, his kin broke the door open and rushed him to Gangolihat’s primary health centre (PHC),” RS Rautela, Circle Officer, Pithoragarh, told TOI.

Pithoragarh’s chief medical superintendent Dr HS Kharayat said that the patient was referred to a higher health facility in Haldwani as his trachea was damaged and his condition was serious. “It has been informed to us that the patient was in depression. During this lockdown, people are spending their time watching TV all day. The constant news regarding coronavirus outbreak can accrue negativity in a person. This can also trigger some people to take drastic steps as this case shows.”
