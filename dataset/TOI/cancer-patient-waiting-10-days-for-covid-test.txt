Ahmedabad: Cancer patient waiting 10 days for Covid-19 test

AHMEDABAD: A 60-year-old cancer patient, who is scheduled to undergo a major surgery to remove cancer of the tongue, has been awaiting a pre-operative test for Covid-19 for the past 10 days now.

Senior cancer surgeon Dr Kiran Kothari said that the patient suffers from third stage cancer of the tongue. 

While onco-surgeons across the country are being allowed to conduct pre-operative Covid-19 testing for safety of the operating surgeon and staff as well as that of the patient, the local authorities are not forthcoming in giving permission.

“The first application to test the patient was made on May 18. The revised application was made on May 20, but there has been no response. 

The authorities are neither permitting nor rejecting the application. In times of Covid pandemic, such permissions should be granted on urgent basis to provide prompt critical healthcare,” said Dr Kothari.

Dr Kothari said that when he discussed this with his peers across the country, majority of them said that pre-operative Covid testing was required and allowed in their states. 

“On one hand, the nation is praising work done by healthcare workers across India, while on the other, their safety is completely neglected. Every one is asked to keep their hospitals or clinics open. But the doctors are allowed to take a call on Covid testing. Many doctors have contracted the illness and some have even lost their lives. The government should ensure that the frontline warriors are not unnecessarily exposed to the risk of Covid-19,” said Dr Kothari. 

“We routinely conduct HIV, HBsAg and HCV tests in all pre operative patients. Why can’t we conduct Covid-19 test? Is it for the benefit of the doctors only? The answer is no. It is beneficial to the patient and his or her relatives, all HCWs and public at large. Unfortunately, the government doesn’t consider doctor’s advice at all.”
