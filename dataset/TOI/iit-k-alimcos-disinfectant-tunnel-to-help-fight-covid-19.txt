Kanpur: In a move towards effective sanitization amid the Covid-19 pandemic, IIT Kanpur’s Technopark and Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) have jointly developed an advanced disinfectant tunnel to sanitize external surfaces and public places. 

Technopark professor in charge Avinash Kumar Agarwal said, “The tunnel, which is designed by IIT-K students and developed by ALIMCO, is a unique one as it boasts of three levels of treatment. The fully automated tunnel fitted with ultrasonic sensors has two chambers with three disinfection processes making it far more efficient than other solutions presently available in neutralising the virus.”

“The sensors are able to sense whether the person is at the entry point of the tunnel or inside the chamber,” informed professor Agarwal. “In chamber one, the person is sprayed with a solution of a disinfectant. In chamber two, they are exposed to a temperature of 70°C and far UVC rays (207-222 nm),” he explained.

ALIMCO general manager,Lt Col PK Dube, said, “We are happy we could develop this tunnel in a stipulated period of time. The high quality disinfectant tunnel can be used for can be used by industries, academic institutions and other public places.”

“As soon as the efficacy test is done, we will be able to start the production from our factories spread across the country within 15 days,” he added.
