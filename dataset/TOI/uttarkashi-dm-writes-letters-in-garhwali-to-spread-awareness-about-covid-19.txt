UTTARKASHI: To spread awareness about Covid-19, the district magistrate of Uttarkashi, Ashish Chauhan, who is a native of Rajasthan, has penned letters in Garhwali, asking villagers in the district to follow social distancing and other guidelines. In the letters, which were sent to gram pradhans and circulated in social media, the DM also appealed to people to show sympathy and offer help to migrants coming from outside

Talking to TOI, Chauhan said, “We have been able to protect Uttarkashi from the Covid-19 pandemic successfully. However, we need maximum support from people to continue the success rate, as things will get tougher with increasing inflow of migrants in the district. Therefore, I decided to write letters in Garhwali to connect with the sentiments of villagers. ”

“We have arranged institutional quarantine facility for migrants showing coronavirus symptoms, whereas other migrants will be quarantined in government schools and panchayat buildings of their respective villages. By sending letters to every gram pradhan, we have tried to avoid any mismanagement in the villages, as they might get frightened or get over excited to see their migrant relatives,” he added.

Meanwhile, locals have appreciated the effort of the DM. Chairman of Red Cross Society Ajay Puri said, “It is a thoughtful gesture for the DM to write to village heads in Garhwali, as it will bring home the message of social distancing and other protocols to be followed effectively.”

District president of gram pradhan sangathan Pratap Rawat said, “The DM's letter has boosted the morale of villagers, who were feeling distressed during this crisis. It has also made us aware of the safety guidelines to be followed and precautions to be taken. All villagers are commited to offering support to both the administration and migrants who are returning.”
