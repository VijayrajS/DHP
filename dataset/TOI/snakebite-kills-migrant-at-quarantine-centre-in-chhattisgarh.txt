RAIPUR: A migrant died from a snakebite at a quarantine centre in Chhattisgarh’s Mungeli in the wee hours of Sunday.


The victim, Yogesh Verma, had fallen asleep on the verandah of a government school that has been converted into a quarantine centre. There are no beds, but “enough mattresses,” said Mungeli Collector Dr Shrveshwar N Bhure.

“The migrant had returned from Maharashtra on Saturday. He was deep in sleep and didn’t realise he was bitten by a snake. Later, he experienced pain in his chest and was taken to hospital but died on his way,” the collector said.
