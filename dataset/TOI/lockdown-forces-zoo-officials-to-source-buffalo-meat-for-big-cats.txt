JAIPUR: The shortage of red meat due to closure of shops in the city owing to lockdown has forced the authorities to procure buffaloes to meet the food requirements of 17 big cats at the Nahargarh Biological Park.

According to officials, chickens can’t fulfil the food needs of lions, tigers and leopards. Therefore, buffaloes will be procured from nearby districts. One buffalo every day is enough to meet the food demand of big cats of park. The slaughter will take place within the park or at the government slaughter house at Chainpura in the city, officials said.

 

Deputy conservator of forest and wildlife Sudarshan Sharma said animals need at least 100 kilogram of meat every day. “One buffalo every day is sufficient. This is an expensive procedure to transport the buffaloes to Jaipur but it is the need of the hour. We pay Rs 100 per kilogram of red meat. Though chicken can be provided but for the big cats, buffalo meat gives more energy,” said Sharma.

Sharma said, “We usually slaughter buffaloes at our park and some at the slaughter house in Chainpura. As we do not have enough sanitation employees at the park premises due to pandemic, slaughtering animals every day is problematic. So, we take help from government slaughter house,” he explained. At the government slaughter house, a veterinary doctor is always present to conduct check-up of animals brought in for slaughter. The doctor gives fitness certificate to the animals. This process takes hours. Other carnivores like jackals usually prefer chicken which is available locally. The zoo keeper who gives meat to the animals is provided with PPE kit.
