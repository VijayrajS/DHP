Covid-19: Containment zones hit the century mark
2020-04-29
NEW DELHI: A large area in South district was turned into a containment zone on Tuesday after two volunteers taking part in food delivery and distribution in and around Mehrauli tested positive for Covid-19. Delhi now has 100 containment zones with the authorities also sealing D Block house numbers 152 to 162 in Shaheen Bagh.

Nirankari Gali, Nakshtra Gali, Nala Boring Gali, Ravan Wali Gali, Jameela Masjid Baoli, Dargah Gurudwara Wali Gali, Thane Wali Gali and Terminal Wali Gali in Mehrauli, housing thousands of people, have been barricaded and police personnel deployed to prevent any unauthorised movement. Even for essential items, the residents will have to depend on home delivery arranged by the authorities.

Three men were helping feed the needy in the area since the nationwide lockdown was announced to fight novel coronavirus. One of them recently developed fever, prompting the authorities to test all three. While the person with fever has been hospitalised, the other positive person has been sent to a Covid care centre. The third person, who has tested negative, is kept in an institutional quarantine facility.

“Nobody living inside the containment zone in Mehrauli has tested positive. But we have sealed the areas as a precautionary step as those two men were volunteering there,” said a senior South district official. All these areas are densely populated, hence it is likely that many people might have come in contact with them, he added. 

The family members of those found positive have been placed under home quarantine and will be tested. As per procedure, the authorities have mounted a massive screening exercise in the area, especially in the containment zone, and will test all suspected people.
