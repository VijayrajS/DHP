2020-04-29
PATNA: Responding to a suggestion from deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) regarding the supply of Aarogya embedded wrist band (AEWB), Union minister for electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday that soon the users of smart and feature phones would be able to download the Aarogya Setu app (ASA) to know their individual position vis-à-vis coronavirus infection.


SuMo, who is also the state’s IT minister, gave his suggestion to Prasad during the latter’s interaction with the IT ministers of various states. Modi said the Centre should provide AEWB which could be tied on the wrists of Covid-19 patients and those in quarantine, so that they could read their body temperature and symptoms of Covid-19 infection and track their movement. He said 38 lakh people in the state had downloaded the ASA, including the maximum 5.62 lakh in Patna and 1.8 lakh from Muzaffarpur.

Referring to the IT-enabled steps taken by the state government in the backdrop of coronavirus outbreak, SuMo said migrant Biharis trapped in other states have been provided Rs1,000 each under CM special assistance programme using the geo-fencing technique in which no person living in Bihar or Nepal can click it.

While the UP and Jharkhand governments have also shared it, a beneficiary has to furnish his selfie photograph, Aadhaar number and bank account for proper verification of his identity for matching. Conversations between prison inmates and their ‘mulakatis (acquaintances)’ have been enabled through videoconferencing.

Further, bank account details and Aadhaar numbers of the 1 crore beneficiaries have also been procured to provide them assistance, Bihar Aapda Sahyog portal was being used to collect Aadhaar numbers and bank account details to prevent duplication of ration cards to be issued to the non-ration card holders, while e-curfew passes were being issued through online mechanism.
