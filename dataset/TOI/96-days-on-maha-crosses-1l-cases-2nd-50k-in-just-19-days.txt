2020-06-13
MUMBAI: Ninety-six days after the coronavirus arrived in the state with a Pune couple returning from a Dubai holiday, Maharashtra surpassed one lakh Covid-19 cases when it added 3,493 fresh cases on Friday. With 40,698 cases reported till Friday, Tamil Nadu is a distant second. If Maharashtra were a country, a total of 1,01,141 cases would have placed it on the 17th position on the global Covid meter, ahead of nations like Canada and China. 


It took the state 77 days to reach its first 50,000 cases since the first case was reported on March 9. The second 50,000 cases, however, have come at a worrying pace—just 19 days.



Covid-19: Latest updates

In 12 days of June alone, the state has added 30,000 cases to its tally. With 127 deaths added on Friday, the state’s overall toll stood at 3,717, placing its death count, too, above that of several countries.


 


While Maharashtra accounts for more than a third of the country’s coronavirus case burden, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region itself accounts for 75% of the disease burden in the state. Mumbai, which remains India’s worst-hit city with 55,451 cases (it added 1,366 cases on Friday), is responsible for 55% of the state’s incidence. Thane and Pune, with a caseload of 16,443 and 11,281 respectively, are also major contributors to the state tally.

On Friday, Mumbai reached another grim milestone by crossing 2,000 deaths. For the third day in a row, the city added at least 90 deaths to its tally; while the toll was exactly 90 on Friday, it was 97 on each of the preceding two days. The city’s toll now stands at 2,044, accounting for 55% of deaths in Maharashtra.

When the Maharashtra government imposed a lockdown on March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Centre, the state had 97 Covid-19 cases.

State health minister Rajesh Tope claimed that the lockdown has helped the state to contain the virus spread and given it time to set up additional healthcare facilities. “If we see cases from countries like the USA and other European countries, we are not that bad. Also, we have only 49,000-odd active cases in the state. The recovery rate in many districts is as high as 70%,” Tope told TOI.

State government officials insisted that the state has used the lockdown to control the spread of the virus and also to add to capacity. Dr Anupkumar Yadav, commissioner of National Health Mission, said the state has created nearly 3 lakh isolation beds during the lockdown. 

Outside of the big-city limits, hotspots like Solapur, Jalgaon, Akola, Dhule and Amravati are now emerging as pockets of concern due to their high death ratio. In places like Jalgaon, officials and deans have been suspended for dereliction of duty while the state task force has been asked to focus on these districts.

Tope added that shortage of ICU and ventilators in Mumbai and nearby regions was a cause for concern and that there was still a ‘hand-to-mouth’ situation. “There is no shortage of beds of any kind in the rest of the state except Mumbai and its neighbouring region. That too is being sorted out,” Tope said.

Within Mumbai, there have been some silver linings. Even though Dharavi has crossed 2,000 cases, there has been a steady decline there in cases and deaths.

Meanwhile, the health department of Bhiwandi-Nizampura Municipal Corporation has sent 45 people into quarantine after its officials came to know that they had attended the funeral of a 53-year-old Covid-19 positive man in Bhiwandi, during which some of the people hugged the deceased’s body and even bathed the body.

The incident came to light in Kamatghar area in Bhiwandi, where recently a 45-year-old man died due to Covid-19 in a Kalwa-based hospital during treatment.

The Kalyan-Dombivli civic corporation areas on Friday reported 185 new Covid-19 patients, taking the total numbers of patients to 1,911 in the region, including 55 deaths so far. This was the first time the number of patients reached three digits in the city in a 24-hour duration.

Thane saw eight new Covid deaths, taking the virus toll there to 145 till date, while 170 fresh cases have been added to its tally which has now breached the 4,500 mark.
