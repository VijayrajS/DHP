Maharashtra: Gangapur villagers plan morcha amid lockdown
2020-05-13
AURANGABAD: Residents from a group of villages in Gangapur taluka have threatened to take out a morcha on May 16 to press for their demand for water tankers. 


Notwithstanding the restrictions in place due to the current lockdown, the villagers have decided on a route of around 40km for the morcha. 

Ganesh Kasabe, a resident of Kadim Takli village in Gangapur taluka, said around 5,000 people were struggling due to water scarcity. 

“We have submitted a requisition for deploying tankers through proper channel way back on March 13. Even after two months, the government authorities have paid no heed to our demand,” said Kasabe.

He added that Kadim Takli and nearby villages were dependant on a well and hand-pump, both of which dried up during summer. “While the government authorities are paying no heed to our demand for water tankers, the private lobby is supplying water to those who can afford it. The current pandemic has posed survival issues before the rural population at large. We cannot afford to spend money on water tankers,” said villagers. 

Communist Party of India (CPI) functionary Ram Baheti said, “It is an irony that the demand for water tankers goes unheard for two months. Hence, the villagers have decided to defy lockdown norms and participate in the morcha in large numbers to press the demand for water tankers.” 

When contacted, Gangapur tehsildar Avinash Shingate said his taluka was already supplying 29 tankers in the areas plagued by water-scarcity. “The remaining proposals are evaluated as per laid down norms. Some of the villagers from the taluka are still receiving water through taps as the water resources have still not dried up. All pending proposals for water tankers will be disposed of after reviewing the ground situation,” said Shingate.
