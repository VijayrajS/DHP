RAJKOT: As many as 10 workers of DCW Chemical Factory in Dhrangadhra, Surendranagar attempted suicide by consuming pesticide on Thursday. They were among the 70-odd contractual workers on hunger strike since past two months demanding permanent employment. 


The workers have been protesting since past 62 days in front of the factory gate. As part of their protests, some workers had their shaved their heads, while others had taken out a rally being half-naked last week. Three of the workers had also threatened self-immolation but were detained by the police before they could attempt self-immolation. 

“The factory employs us on contractual basis for just 15 days and in the remaining days of the month, we sit idle without work. We have been asking the factory management to take us on their payroll as permanent employees,” said Pramod Chauhan, one of the workers who had consumed pesticide.

“Our demand was permanent employment to the kin of the workers after their retirement and employment to the kin of any worker who died on duty,” said Manish Sindhav, another agitating factory worker.

After nearly two months of agitation, the workers consumed pesticide on Thursday. They were taken to Dhrangadhra Civil Hospital from where some of the workers whose condition was serious were referred to Surendranagar Civil Hospital. At present, the condition of the workers is out of danger.

Meanwhile, nobody from the factory management was available for comments.
