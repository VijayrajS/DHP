2020-04-15
Mysuru: In a bid to help students utilize the lockdown period properly, a private school in the city has launched an online project challenge. Called Armageddon, the project is aimed at leveraging technology to engage students of class VI-IX in contextual, meaningful and thought provoking activities during the prolonged summer vacation.

According to the school authorities, the project offers students opportunities to access authentic and curated content to learn about novel coronavirus. It also enables students to collaborate with each other within the safe confines of their homes as the learning is facilitated through an online tool.

"The project explores many facets of Covid-19 crisis such as epidemiology, economic, social and political impacts. It also introduces students to the skills to be used to address challenges related to the crisis. While the project has been designed for self learning, mentors will be available to guide students through the project. The output of the challenges will be evaluated by a team of experts and prizes will be awarded to the best teams,‚Äù said the authorities.

This is completely an online project, delivered on ProjectMaker. Students form teams, conduct virtual meetings, use collaborative authoring tools, manage and maintain documents and together create an online portfolio. The projects are evaluated by experts based on a set of rubrics for various parameters including innovation and creativity, team work, methodology and presentation. There are eleven challenges which includes delivery of essentials, new social order, bilateral relations, contact tracing and awareness campaign design, etc.
