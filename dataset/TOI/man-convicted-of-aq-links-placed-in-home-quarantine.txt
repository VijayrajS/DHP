Hyderabad: A 40-year-old engineer from the city, who had been convicted in USA for having links with Al-Qaeda, reached Hyderabad on Monday night after being deported from the United States on May 19. After reaching home, he was placed under quarantine.

Family members of Mohammad Ibrahim Zubair, along with Cyberabad police went to Nagpur and brought him to his residence in Hasmathpet, Alwal. “He has been placed under home quarantine at his family’s flat in Hasmathpet,” Cyberabad police said.

A resident of Moghulpura, he finished his graduation in engineering from Osmania University and later moved to USA in 2001 to pursue higher education. Subsequently in 2006, he married a US national.

Zubair was convicted by a US grand jury in 2011 and sentenced to five years imprisonment after he pleaded guilty of providing material support to Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. 

“There are no cases against him in India. Once the quarantine period is over, we will question him,” said a Telangana police official.
