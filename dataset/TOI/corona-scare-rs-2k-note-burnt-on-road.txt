2020-04-22
SURAT: With coronavirus overtaking all other fears, a team of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) in Puna area of the city on Monday didn’t think twice before burning a Rs 2,000 currency note to cinders. 

The note was discovered on the road lying in a suspicious condition. Police initiated an inquiry in the incident to find out if it was an act done intentionally to create panic. 

Recently, three currency notes were allegedly dropped on a footpath in Chandi Chowk area of the city by a man after applying saliva and sweat on them. The earlier incident had created a massive panic in the area. 

The note on Tuesday was spotted by a local resident at around 10.30 am who called up the police and placed a stone on it to prevent it from blowing away. Police visited the spot and after questioning locals they called the SMC which sent a team that first sanitized the note and later burnt it. “As per the instructions they received from their seniors the SMC team sanitized the note and burnt it. Police also registered an informal complaint and started investigation," said Puna police.

Cops collected CCTV footages from the nearby spot to check if some miscreant had intentionally dropped the high-token currency note. 

“The offence is not yet registered since it is not clear if it is an intentional act. We are registering statements of locals to check if they noticed any person in suspicious movement,” the officer added.

In recovery of Rs 500, Rs 200 and Rs 100 currency notes from Chandni Chowk, police had seized the notes from the spot and sent them for tests. However, NCH and FSL denied having any technique to check infection on any object.
