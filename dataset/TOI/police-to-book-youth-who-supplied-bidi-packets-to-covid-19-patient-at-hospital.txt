PILIBHIT: The police are all set to lodge an FIR against a 25-year-old man, identified as Ajay Sharma of Dal Chan locality in Pilibhit, who supplied bidi packets to a Covid-19 patient at LH State Ayurvedic College Hospital.

According to official sources, the patient persuaded Ajay Sharma, who was at the Covid-19 ward, to buy him bidi packets. The incident took place on Friday evening.

Notably, district magistrate Vaibhav Shrivastav had prohibited tobacco stores from opening temporarily in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The police rushed to the spot after being informed by an anonymous person and recovered the bidi packets from the patient.

Circle officer of Pilibhit city Praveen Malik said a written complaint is awaited from the end of the health department after which an FIR would be lodged.

“Whether the accused was to be kept in quarantine jail or institutional quarantine, will be decided by the remand magistrate, before whom the accused will be produced after lodging the FIR,” he said.

However, chief medical officer Dr Seema Agarwal said the youth would be kept in institutional quarantine after his arrest.

When asked whether any action would be taken against staff for the lapse, Agarwal said, “I will seek an explanation from the concerned staff.”
