MARGAO: No positive case of coronavirus has been detected in Goa so far, so there is “no reason to panic at the moment,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday.

“All necessary precautions are being taken. By tomorrow, thermal scanners will be installed, first at the airport followed by at the MPT and then at railway stations. The health secretary is handling the matter,” Sawant told reporters on the sidelines of a zilla panchayat campaign meeting at Davorlim.

He urged people not to come in close contact with those coming to Goa from across the borders. 

To a query, Sawant said that there were sufficient stocks of all essential commodities in the state, but cautioned people to bear with the situation if it comes to that.
