Vijayawada: In a bid to curtail the rising number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city, police on Monday started to quarantine people found violating lockdown orders and roaming around in Krishna Lanka.

City police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao ordered police personnel to detail violators in an ambulance kept on standby. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Vikrant Patil and assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Suryachandra Rao conducted a special enforcement drive in the area.

Krishna Lanka is the biggest hotspot in the city with 18 positive Covid-19 cases reported from the area in one day. Addressing the media, south zone ACP Suryachandra Rao said the number of lockdown violations have come under control after the initiative. 

“We would continue quarantining violators till we achieve complete compliance. We have set up an ambulance and sent all the violators to the respective quarantine centres for a period of 14 days,” Rao said. 

Police sources said similar initiatives have been undertaken in states such as Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
