Rajkot: While the government’s order for lockdown in the wake of coronavirus outbreak was being enforced in Rajkot, two groups clashed over the issue of playing cricket on Tuesday evening.

Four persons — two from the each group — were injured in a clash that broke out in Rukhadiapara locality of Rajkot.

“While three persons wanted to play gully cricket in the locality, the other three from the other group objected to their playing amid the orders for lockdown. Soon the altercation snowballed into a clash in which the members of both the groups attacked each other with iron pipes, scythes and knives,” said an official from Pradyumannagar police station.

Those injured were identified as Rajesh Chauhan (19), Sahil (20), Imran Sipahi (32) and Hussein Goli (30). “While Chauhan, Sahil and their friend Mustafa were playing cricket, Sipahi and Goli objected, leading to the altercation and subsequent clash,” added the official.
