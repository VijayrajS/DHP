2020-06-08
Hyderabad: Hospitality player TajGVK Hotels & Resorts Ltd has informed the bourses that the Covid-19 outbreak has impacted the financials of the company and its joint ventures for the first quarter of the current fiscal as most of its hotels had to be shut down completely during the lockdown and the impact is expected to be felt in the coming quarter as well. 

“Since the situation is exceptional and changing dynamically the company…believes there will be impact in sales volume, revenue and profitability for Q1 and Q2 FY21 as our hotel operations are presently shut and will gradually ramp up only after the resolution of the pandemic,” it said in a regulatory filing.

The company said five of its hotels were shut down entirely during the lockdown phase as the company was not part of the government denominated essential services. Only one hotel was operating at minimum occupancy, it said.

TajGVK said while revenues are expected to be softer in the initial phase of the lockdown and for some time after it is lifted, mainly due to lower occupancies and limited F&B offtake arising out of reduced business and leisure travel, the company does not see any challenge in recovery post the revival of the economy as all its hotels are operating under the iconic Taj brand.

The company said it has put in place a series of steps to optimise costs across all the lines namely raw material, manpower, power & fuel, corporate overheads, among others. “The company is also in discussion with its lessors for waiver or deferment of lease rentals or concession fee during the lockdown period. Cash conservation measures have also been initiated such as deferral of capex & renovation plans unless absolutely required for upkeep of operations,” it said.

The hospitality player, which is a joint venture between GVK Group and Indian Hotels Company Ltd, said it was faced with a lot of cancellations of confirmed bookings but continued to explore different opportunities under the Vande Bharat programme in Hyderabad and stays for healthcare workers at its Taj Santacruz.
