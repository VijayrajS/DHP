Coronavirus in Delhi: SDMC to separate cold, cough patients
2020-03-09
NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to make separate arrangements at its dispensaries, maternity homes and hospitals for people affected with cold, cough and other respiratory issues so that they don’t come in contact with other patients. 


“There are 112 dispensaries, maternity homes and hospitals under our jurisdiction. It was decided at a meeting chaired by the commissioner that people afflicted with even common cold and cough will be directed to OPDs from the entrance only. This will help avoid their movement in the main complex,” a senior SDMC official said.

The civic agencies, which have created isolation wards in the medical centres for suspected Covid-19 patients, have started distributing masks to doctors and other staff.

Through an official circular, the health department of EDMC has advised setting up of separate OPD counters at Swami Dayanand and Veer Savarkar hospitals for flu-affected patients. North corporation, too, has also marked a 14-bed ward in Hindu Rao Hospital for suspected novel coronavirus patients besides distributing 3,000 N-95 masks and deputing a nodal officer.

The agencies are taking precautions to avoid crowds at citizen bureau centres and property tax offices. “We may arrange for more counters to avoid queues at citizen bureau centres, considering that March 31 is the last date for submitting house tax,” the official added. 

Senior EDMC officials have also been asked to conduct meetings with resident welfare associations and traders’ association, requesting them to avoid social gatherings for Holi.
