GANDHINAGAR: The state Congress on Thursday launched ‘E-Janmitra Covid-19’, a web application through which affected persons can seek help during the ongoing crisis. The BJP attacked the Congress, saying it was shedding crocodile tears.

Launching the web application, GPCC chief Amit Chavda said, “Our workers received a lot of feedback from the masses that the Covid-19 crisis has been mismanaged by the state government. Migrant workers and others don’t know where to look for help. This is why the party has developed the ‘E-Janmitra Covid-19’ web application.” He added that the Congress will assist migrant workers, and other affected people using the app.

Responding to the Congress’ announcement, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja sid the Congress is just shedding crocodile tears.
