Covid-19 lockdown dampens prospects for mango farmers in Andhra Pradesh
2020-04-06
VIJAYAWADA: The nationwide lockdown has hurt the mango trade this year with a fall in prices and farmers hesitating to harvest the crop due to lack of transport facilities.


Mango is cultivated across a large stretch in the Nuzvid region in Krishna district. Varieties such as Banginapalli, Chinna Rasalu, Pedda Rasalu, Neelalu, Jalalu and Collector are especially popular in markets in northern states while Asia’s largest mango market at Nunna draws exporters from across the country in the first week of May.

This year, the lockdown has farmers in the district worried. No buyers have come forward as there is no scope to transport the crop to the markets. “Sooty mold and other infections had hurt the crop in the last five years. We have overcome it and received good flowering this year. The expected early crop is ready for the harvest but no exporter is coming forward to buy fruits from us. They are highly perishable and we need the support of the government,” said K Chenna Reddy, a farmer from Idara village. 

“We are even ready to sell our crop directly to the consumers through mobile rythu bazaars and makeshift markets arranged in Vijayawada, Guntur, Eluru and nearby cities and towns,” Chenna Reddy said. 

MVS Nagi Reddy, vice-chairman of Andhra Pradesh state agriculture mission told TOI that the government will extend help to mango farmers. “Poor transport has had a severe impact on the export of mangoes to other states. The agriculture marketing department will facilitate the farmers in selling their products through markets across the state. The local sale will help them in this tough time,” he said. 

Nagi Reddy also urged farmers to focus on selling their crop in local markets instead of transporting it to other states.
