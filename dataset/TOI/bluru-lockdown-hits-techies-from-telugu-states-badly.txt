2020-03-27
Hyderabad: The closing down of hostels and PG accommodation in Bengaluru has hit a large number of IT professionals and other workers from Telugu states. On Thursday, Bengaluru city police commissioner Bhaskar Rao said if PG and hostel owners ask inmates to leave, it would be illegal. “They must provide food too,” he said. The commissioner said if this was not done they would be prosecuted. “It’s loud and clear,” he said in a tweet.

A worker from Jagtial in Telangana employed with a pharmaceutical company told TOI from Bengaluru that he was forced to sleep on the road for last two nights. “Everyone in the PG accommodation where I was staying were forced to leave by the owners,” he said. 

Prashanth (22), who has been working in Bengaluru for the last one year, said he was without food because of the lockdown. “I approached the local police who were passing by for help to send me to my hometown but they did not respond,” he said.

A resident of Siddipet, Bharath said both his sisters in Bengaluru were also facing a severe problem after they were evicted from their PG accommodation. While one of them is employed with a software company, another went there to join a company but the appointment order was cancelled because of the lockdown.

Both of them were staying in an area where there are several buildings from where PG accommodation is run. “Despite the orders of the police, the owners have evicted many people. My sisters wanted to return home but are stuck there because of the lockdown. We have no relatives in Bengaluru and they have nowhere to go,” Bharath said. 

He has also tried to reach public representatives in Siddipet for help but has not been able to meet them. Bharath said he has been trying to meet finance minister T Harish Rao for help.
