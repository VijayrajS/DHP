BAREILLY: In an attempt to fight the coronavirus pandemic, some 60 members of a women self-help group at Mohanpur village, under Bithri Chainpur block of Bareilly, have been stitching approximately 3,000 face masks a day and selling them to local government bodies, medical stores and shops under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).

These women are stitching three-layered cotton masks at a wedding hall, that has been taken over by the SHG. 

The face masks are being sold at Rs 20 each. 

NRLM is a poverty alleviation project implemented by ministry of rural development, Government of India, with an aim to promote self-employment among rural poor. 

Block mission manager, Rashtriya Gramin Ajaivika Mission (NRLM), Manju Rathod told TOI, “Under the mission, women from rural areas in the district who were facing hardships due to the lockdown, joined to stitch face masks in order to earn some money while assisting in the ongoing fight against Covid-19. Stalls have been put up at Vikas Bhavan as well as in Bithri block for selling these face masks at Rs 20 a piece.”

Rathod added, “To local government bodies, the face masks are being sold at Rs 13.60 each. The masks are also being sold at medical stores and shops for Rs 20 each. To undertake stitching work, a wedding hall has been occupied where sewing machines have been set up. All the women wear face masks and maintain social distancing. Women members have earned around Rs 2 lakh so far.” 

Commending the women for their work, Bareilly district magistrate Nitish Kumar said, “Approximately 50,000 masks have so far been prepared and dispatched by these women. We are providing the face masks to sanitation workers among others, free of cost."
