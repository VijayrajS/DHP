Fight the ‘paan-demic’ to tackle coronavirus: Locals on Twitter
2020-03-17
Hyderabad: With public heath authorities spreading awareness on hygiene to curb the spread of coronavirus, locals have taken to social media to attack the ‘paan-demic.’ Concerned residents have been urging a crackdown against those spitting in public places after chewing paan.

Many locals have even gone on to suggest a temporary ban on sale of paan. “Panshops and panmasala should also be banned temporarily, spitting is a big nuisance,” tweeted B V Seshagiri. 

Citing spitting as a problem that can be seen across the city, Bhushan Reddy tweeted: “This is one of the major problems in urban sanitation. Behavioral change is the need of the hour. @GHMCOnline Should act heavily on people spreading this paan-demic. A common scene in most government buildings and washrooms.” 

Providing examples of action taken in other states, Hyd Intellectuals (@HydForum) tweeted: “Gujarat govt today passed an ordinance today, imposing Rs.500 on those who spit on Roads, Public places. We need such enforcements in Hyd too.” (sic) 

“There are good laws under Indian Police Act Section 34 as well as Railway premises rules 2012 which must be implemented effectively to stop this menace,” said Forum Against Corruption vice-president, Sai Teja.
