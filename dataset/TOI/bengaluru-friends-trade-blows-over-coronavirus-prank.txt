Bengaluru: Two friends thrashed each other over a coronavirus prank near Jayanagar on Saturday evening. Siddapura police said they have registered a case and a counter-case. 


According to police, a 24-year-old labourer, Preetham R Makam, visited a clinic accompanied by his wife following a health problem he was facing on Saturday evening. 

He later rushed to a nearby medical store to buy medicines. His friend Naveen DS, 34, who owns a textile shop in the vicinity, noticed Preetham near the medical store and asked him what had happened to him. "Naveen asked Preetham if he had loose motion or coronavirus. Preetham lost his cool over Naveen's coronavirus joke and for making fun of him in front of his wife. The duo got into a heated argument and later hit each other," police said. 

Police registered a case of assault and criminal intimidation against Preetham on Sunday based on a complaint filed by Naveen. Officers summoned Preetham for interrogation. He appeared before police on Monday and filed a counter-complaint. A case was registered against Naveen under the same provisions.
