2020-03-30
PUNE: The Pune rural police on Saturday registered offences against four morning walkers in Narayangaon. Another person found wandering on the road in Kamshet in the evening was also booked.

“During the lockdown, people are expected to stay at their homes, not head out for their daily morning walk,” said inspector Arjun Ghode Patil of Narayangaon police station. The officer added that the police teams have been appealing to people to remain indoors. 

Even so, some people were seen stepping out of their homes early in the morning. “On Saturday, we fanned out teams to trace morning walkers. We found four people and registered offences against them,” Ghode Patil said.

“They claimed that they had stepped out of their homes when there were hardly anyone on the road. People should know that they will remain safe indoors,” the officer added.

Similarly, an officer from Kothrud police station noticed a few elderly people on an evening walk on Saturday. “I requested them to return home as they are the most vulnerable right now,” the officer said.

PMC corporator Alpna Varpe too has appealed to people to put morning walks on hold for now. She warned that the police will take action against morning walkers.
