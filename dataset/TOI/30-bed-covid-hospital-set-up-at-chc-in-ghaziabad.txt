2020-03-30
Ghaziabad: A 30-bed hospital only for Covid-19 patients has been set up at a community health centre in Muradnagar. Six doctors and 19 medical staff have been deputed for round-the-clock duty at the hospital.

The staff will be divided into two teams — rotated every 15 days. When one team finishes its rotation, the other will take over. The first will then be in quarantine for 15 days. “Doctors and staff will be living at the hospital in an arrangement called active quarantine,” chief medical officer NK Gupta said. “In the meantime, if anyone encounters a problem, they will be treated.”

Staff will be trained from Monday and the hospital will start admitting patients in a couple of days. The team will have six doctors, six nurses, two pharmacists, three ward boys, six sweepers and two lab technicians.

Four private hospitals — Surya Hospital, ITS Muradnagar, Santosh Hospital and Sunder Deep Ayurvedic Hospital — have been acquired by the Ghaziabad district administration and five others kept on standby. 

The district has 500 beds in its quarantine facilities as of now. There are 40 ambulances, including five equipped with advance life support (ALS) system. 

As of now, two ALS and six ambulances are exclusively for Covid-19 patients. 

Apart from this, another isolation ward of 24 beds has been set up at the District MMG Hospital. At present, there are 45 beds for those who test positive and those being monitored. 

There are six beds at the District Combined Hospital for those under observation. A quarantine facility has been prepared at the District Women Hospital as well.
