Andhra Pradesh: Travel restrictions a challenge for cancer patients in lockdown
2020-04-25
VISAKHAPATNAM: Lack of awareness, delayed diagnosis and treatment have always been a challenge for cancer patients. But the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has made matters worse as patients face travel restrictions and scarcity of drugs.


Cancer treatments are delivered in multiple sessions over a period of time either by radiation therapy or chemotherapy under day care. This is a difficulty as patients have to travel daily. Many of them are stuck in various districts and neighbouring states due to lack of public transport or inability to afford private transportation.

Moreover, doctors say that patients are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia due to their immunosuppressive state resulting from malignancy and anti-tumour therapy. Getting timely and continuous treatment is the key for cancer patients. 

Keeping these into consideration, HCG Cancer Centre is mobilising ambulances from various districts so that patients do not suffer due to the lockdown. 

The cancer centre is also offering free transportation, accommodation and hygienic food for both patients and their attenders so that their scheduled treatments continue without interruption. 

“We have more than 70 patients under treatment at HCG Cancer Centre where accommodation and food are being provided for free. With the lockdown having effects on logistics, we have stock over two months inventory of medicines and consumables,” said Dr Vijayaditya, consultant radiation oncologist at HCG Cancer Centre.

Satyaprasad (name changed), a cancer patient, had his chemotherapy scheduled in the third week of April. He had to travel from Berhampur, which is 280 km from Vishakhapatnam. “A hospital pass was issued certifying the essential treatment required. The chemotherapy was performed at the right time. If not, my condition would have become worse,” he said.
