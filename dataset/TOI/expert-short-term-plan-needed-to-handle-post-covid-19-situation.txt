Trichy: NIT-Trichy director Mini Shaji Thomas, while stressing the need for a short-term strategic plan to handle the situation post Covid-19 crisis in the engineering institutions, said that conducting examinations and timely declaration of results for outgoing students could be a bigger challenge besides attracting foreign students this year.

She was addressing a webinar session organized on Wednesday by Tiruchirappalli Local Centre of The Institution of Engineers (India) on ‘Challenges and contributions of engineering Institution to combat Covid-19’. While uncertainty over reopening of institutes continues, she said pending semester classes in NIT-T have already been completed by engaging students through digital platforms. Further, there are plans to conduct semester examination through online mode for the theoretical subjects.

She said that many of the decisions taken like conducting online examinations for final year students and conducting online viva for research scholars were taken after conducting a survey with the students.

She said that the institutions need to focus on research funding from industries as projects from government agencies are shrinking. Attracting foreign students could be a challenge in these testing times including their scholarships, she said. She lauded engineering institutions that came up with lots of products to fight Covid-19 pandemic. “NIT-T students alone have submitted 173 projects related to Covid-19 and we are trying to materialise as many as possible,” she said.

Explaining the challenges in conducting classes after reopening, such as financial viability, infrastructure development, alumni engagement and the challenges for residential institutions, she suggested adoption of short-term strategic plan to run the institutions amid all odds.

More than 100 participants participated in this online program held through video conferencing mode. TNN
