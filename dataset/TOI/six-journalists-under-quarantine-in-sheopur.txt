2020-04-09
Bhopal: In a classic case of neglect and carelessness, half a dozen journalists have become Covid-19 suspect and were sent to a 14-day quarantine in Sheopur on Wednesday. All of them were in continuous contact with a family of a man who is the first corona positive case in the district. 

Earlier, a quack in Sheopur was tested positive for coronavirus. About 56 years of age, the man was already suffering from tuberculosis and had a weak immune system. His son, a student, had returned from Indore, which has turned out to be coronavirus hotspot in Madhya Pradesh. Though he had returned from Indore on March 27, he did not show any symptoms for coronavirus. But his father had started coughing and sneezing. Soon, he turned out to be a corona positive.

Two of the Sheopur-based journalists were interacting with the family of the ‘doctor’. Ignoring the social distancing concept, they had even visited his house. 

A spokesman of the district administration said that after the man was tested positive, the administration started looking for people who contacted the family. So far, six journalists have been identified and all of them are being quarantined in a hostel building.
