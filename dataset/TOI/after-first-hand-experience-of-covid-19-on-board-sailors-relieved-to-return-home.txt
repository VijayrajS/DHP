PANAJI: After being stranded on board a cruiseliner in Italy for close to 80 days and watching their colleagues get infected with and recover from Covid-19, seafarers are relieved to be on their way back home to Goa. 


Around 400 seafarers were sent to Goa in three flights from Italy that were chartered by their company last week. More are on their way. 

“I didn’t believe I was going home until I got my ticket in hand. I had almost given up hope,” one of them told TOI. 

There were more than 12 crew who tested positive on board his vessel, including Goans. They were shifted to hospitals while the rest of the crew were isolated in their cabins, until recently. 

Another of his colleagues who initially tested negative when he left Italy, tested positive in Goaand was among the first seven Covid-19 patients detected in the state. “When we heard of him and others who turned positive, we were very afraid. I couldn’t sleep at all. After a while, we got used to it and now we believe this has made our immune systems stronger. I hope we test negative in Goa. It’s a risk because we travelled through airports,” he told TOI. 

They were not informed about how many crew and passengers tested positive on the vessel. 

“We would find out much later as we were all isolated in our rooms. Those with fever were isolated in a separate section on the ship. All our meals were delivered to our rooms. We began eating together only around a week ago when all the positive cases had recovered and after we were isolated for more than two months,” another seafarer told TOI. 

They were shifted from crew cabins—where two are accommodated—to passenger cabins with one crew member in each. They were permitted to leave only for a few hours each day when on duty.
