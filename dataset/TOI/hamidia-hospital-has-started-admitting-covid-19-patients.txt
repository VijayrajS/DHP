BHOPAL: State capitalâ€™s largest tertiary care institution, Hamidia hospital, has now started admitting Covid-19 patients, indicating that another phase of corona infections in the state capital and surrounding districts has started.

The hospital has been divided into three broad zones - non-Covid area, Covid area - looking after patients with mild to moderate illness, and critical area, including the ICU. In addition, a triage area has been developed in the emergency zone, where patients with acute severe respiratory illness are admitted, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) dean and Hamidia hospital superintendent, Dr AK Shrivastava. 

The facility that started on Wednesday has been set up keeping the guidelines issued by ministry of health and family welfare in mind, regarding general principles of category of department, based on clinical exposure and participation in the management of critically-ill patients. 

Currently, four Covid-19 patients are being treated at the hospital. Most of the corona patients are in a private medical college while most of the critical patients are being handled by AIIMS Bhopal. A hospital infection control committee (HICC) has been set up for reporting development of symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 along with surveillance for fever/cough/breathing difficulty through either self-reporting or active and passive screening at the beginning of the shift. 

The committee will also monitor patients (admitted for non-Covid illness) for development of unexplained fever/cough/breathing difficulty during their stay, said an official.
