JAIPUR: As on April 15, as many as 43% of Covid-19 patients in Jaipur were in the age group of 20-40 years. According to official statistics, out of 483 cases, 208 were in the 20-40 year bracket. The situation becomes further worrisome when 80% of them were found to be asymptomatic while rest had mild symptoms. 

Commenting on the trend, SMS Hospital medical superintendent DS Meena said, “Even those in much younger age groups (0-20 years) are either asymptomatic or show just mild symptoms. The blessing in disguise is that none of them in the age group of 0-60 years are in serious condition.” 

The authorities are already focussing on the youths during random testing. “The figure makes it clear that the young population of Ramganj cannot be ignored till they show any symptoms. Also, the challenge is they are a big threat to their elderly family members,” said Aqeel Khan, an area magistrate. Figures said just 42 are from the vulnerable age group of 60 years and above. Meena said those in this category are in a critical condition due to co-morbidity. 

The figures also highlighted that in every four every third Covid-19 patient is a woman. “This makes clear two things — cramped-up living in the Walled City makes it impossible for women to follow social distancing and poor health of women in these areas,” said Meena.
