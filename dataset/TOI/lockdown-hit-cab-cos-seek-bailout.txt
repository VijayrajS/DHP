Lockdown-hit cab companies seek bailout
2020-04-21
HYDERABAD: With at least 2,000 of the 6,000-odd companies staring at a shutdown and over one-third of the one million workforce likely to lose their jobs, the Hyderabad chapter of All India Car Rental (AICR) group, on Monday, approached the government for aid. Ruing the fact that most firms have suffered a 95% loss in revenue over the last one month, its members appealed to the state to provide financial aid (for payment of salaries) and extend rebate on taxes, to help the travel industry.


AICR comprises car and bus rental companies across India. According to official data, the city has a fleet of 35,000 to 40,000 cabs – excluding cab aggregators – that directly employ over a lakh people. The industry provides indirect employment to around 10 lakh individuals. 

“It has been a struggle for many companies to pay March salaries to their staff. Some have even had to borrow funds from friends and relatives, apart from cleaning out their personal accounts, for payments. At this moment, we are not sure whether we will be able to pay April salaries since business has come to a naught,” said Ashwin Jain, vice-president, AICR. He added: “Even after the lockdown, it will take a minimum of six months for us to start getting business. People are going to be apprehensive about travelling and that’s going to hit us hard.” 

“We have reached out all the senior officials in the transport department and are hoping to hear from them soon,” said Somik Sharma, general secretary of AICR stressing how a waiver of quarterly taxes -- for maxicabs and buses for the next two quarters -- is a pressing need as many have already defaulted on its payment. “Most companies do not have the funds to take care of such expenses,” he said.
