HYDERABAD: Confusion prevailed on Wednesday over the closure notice served on hostels and telling the inmates to vacate immediately in the wake of coronavirus scare. While GHMC insisted that all hostels must shut down immediately, the IT industry Covid committee said private hostels could function and that only hostels run by educational institutions should be closed.

GHMC officials visited various hostels on Tuesday night and issued an ultimatum to the inmates to make alternative arrangements within 24 hours. Employees and students residing in these hostels are livid. Several of them said they do not have an alternative place to stay and they were not allowed to work from home. 

“I was informed that I need to vacate the hostel in 24 hours. I booked flight tickets for my brother and myself, but flights have been cancelled. Train tickets are running full. I request the authorities to give us some more time,” said Anuradha, a teacher in private school residing in a hostel at SR Nagar.

V Dasharath, a software engineer and an inmate of a hostel in Kondapur, said they do not have the option to work from home. “Where will I go,” he wondered.

The Covid panel held a video conference on Wednesday and said hostels run by educational institutions should be closed. “Private hostels can remain open,” said Bharani Kumar, a member of the committee. Cyberabad police chief VC Sajjanar is nodal officer of the panel.

A verification done by TOI revealed that several hostel managements are yet to receive the Covid committee’s order.
