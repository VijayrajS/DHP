Sambalpur: The Covid-19 test laboratory at Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, will become functional from Sunday with the capacity to test 90 samples per day in two shifts, said health and family welfare minister Naba Kishore Das, who visited the hospital to review progress of laboratory work here on Saturday.

Das said with the functioning of the laboratory here at VIMSAR, the Recombinant Technology Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt PCR) test will be possible. “We will get the test report of the suspected Covid-19 patients here after the laboratory becomes operational,” he added. He said if required two additional rt PCR machines would be installed to scale up testing capacity, he said. 

Currently, Vimsar is sending throat swab samples of the suspected Covid-19 patients to the Regional Medical Research Center (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, for the test.

Das also inquired how the isolation ward of the VIMSAR is functioning and instructed the hospital authorities to provide all kind of facilities to the doctors and the para-medical staffs involved in Covid duty.

On the other hand, the Junior Doctors Association (JDA) of VIMSAR submitted a memorandum to the health minister demanding good facilities for the medical and paramedical staffs, who are under quarantine to provide service to the suspected Covid-19 patients at VIMSAR.
