Now, HCQ for police on Covid duty
2020-05-24
Vijayawada: The Union health ministry, in its revised advisory, has brought three more categories of people under the umbrella of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis (treatment given or action taken to prevent disease), at a time when most discussions are centred on the efficacy of the drug in patients with Covid-19. 

As per the earlier advisory, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended HCQ as a prophylactic agent only for healthcare personnel involved in the care of suspected or confirmed Covid cases and for asymptomatic household contacts of the Covid-19 positive patients. But the chemoprophylaxis (the use of drugs to prevent disease) with HCQ is now also recommended for the frontline workers such as surveillance workers deployed in containment zones and the paramilitary/police personnel involved in Covid-19 related activities. 

However, the Union health ministry reiterated that the intake of HCQ should not instil a sense of false security.
