Cops chase & thrash trader for violating lockdown, suspended
2020-05-28
Agra: Agra SSP Babloo Kumar has suspended two policemen on Wednesday after a video clip of them surfaced purportedly chasing and assaulting a local trader on a two-wheeler with sticks for not stopping and taking a "deliberate U-turn" after spotting them.

The incident took place at 'C' Block of Kamla Nagar under New Agra police limits when the 55-year-old trader Rakesh Gupta, who runs a transport business, tried to "flee" after finding police personnel who were on Covid-19 lockdown duty. In the video, the two constables on their motorcycle could be seen chasing Gupta to his house and then beating him with sticks. The trader was also apparently not wearing a face mask and helmet. 

The suspended cops were identified as constable Rakesh Sharma and Dinesh of Cheetah mobile force. Their task was to keep a watch on the movement of locals at Shreeram intersection.

Agra SSP Kumar said, “This kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Both the cops have been suspended.”

Speaking to TOI, Dr Sanjay Gupta, the victim's younger cousin said, “Rakesh Gupta had gone to a nearby grocery to buy bread for breakfast. He had just travelled 50m on his two-wheeler, when he saw the cops at a checkpoint. He made a U-turn after seeing the policemen. This provoked them and they chased him down home.”

SHO of New Agra Umesh Chandra Tripathi told TOI, “Rakesh Gupta’s house is not 50m, but farther away from Shreeram Chouraha where policemen were on duty. After seeing the policemen, he tried to flee like a thief and took a U-turn. So, the cops had to go after him. The constable even requested Gupta to stop, but he didnt.”

Agra SP city Rohan Botre said, “After a detailed investigation, I’ll submit a report to Agra SSP for any further action.”

Meanwhile, following the incident, local traders' association demanded immediate medical aid to Gupta and FIR against the two policemen.
