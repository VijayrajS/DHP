Under lockdown, Goa’s jobless rate hits 13% in April

PANAJI: An extended lockdown from March 22 led to a rise in Goa’s unemployment rate, as it touched 13.3% in April from 2.8% in February. With the state economy coming almost to a standstill, stakeholders said joblessness could rise further if the government doesn’t take bold steps to revive economic activity.

The Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) did not detail the reasons for the rise in unemployment but industrialists and business insiders said the uncertainty over lifting lockdown and economic revival prompted many companies and small businesses to reduce their staff.

“To tell you frankly, I could not pay my staff and I asked them to leave. Tourism will not start anytime soon, and I can’t afford to keep my workers till the economy revives,” said a small hotelier from South Goa.

CMIE pegs the national unemployment at 24.7%. It shows that Goa’s unemployment figures are similar to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, while Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Telangana at 2.9%, 3.4%, and 6.2%, respectively, have fared relatively better.

“Goa just hit a five-month high unemployment rate of 13.3% in April. This is up from 2.1% from November 2018 and an average of 7% in recent years. With tourism sector likely to be subdued through the year, this will lead to further increase in unemployment,” said principal and professor of economics at Shree Mallikarjun and Shri Chetan Desai College of Arts and Commerce Manoj Kamat.
