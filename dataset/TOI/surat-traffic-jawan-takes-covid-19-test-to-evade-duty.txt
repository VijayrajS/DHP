2020-04-12
Surat: A 32-year-old traffic brigade jawan got his Covid-19 tests done at SMIMER Hospital, apparently to avoid coming on duty during this critical time. The jawan, Naresh Makwana, got his test done on Thursday without informing his seniors and stayed quarantined at home for two days as per doctors instructions after his samples were collected.On Saturday, the traffic police received a report that Makwana had tested negative."Makwana did not inform me or any senior colleague that he is feeling sick. He went directly to hospital without seeking approval and got himself tested. He informed the department only after he was instructed home quarantine," said A P Chauhan, assistant commissioner of police, traffic.Makwana was suffering from cold and cough after which he went for testing. He provided his wrong address to establish that he lives in city even as he is a resident of Kadodara near Surat."It seems Makwana wanted leave and did not wish to work. We are paying minimum salary to few TRB jawan who live in villages far from city and they are allowed to stay home. He also wanted similar benefits but was not eligible for it since Kadodara is near the city and he was not given leave," said Chauhan."Since the report is negative now senior police officials will decide further actions against Makwana," said the officer.
