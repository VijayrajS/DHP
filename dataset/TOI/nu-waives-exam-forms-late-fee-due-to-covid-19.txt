2020-05-01
Nagpur: In a major decision that will benefit lakhs of students, Nagpur University has decided to waive late fee for students filling up examination forms after the deadline. The decisions have been taken in view of Covid-19 outbreak in the country that has led to the indefinite deferment of majority of NU’s summer examinations. NU usually charges Rs50 late fee, if the students fill up exam forms within 15 days after the deadline. The amount is Rs1,500 in next 15 days, and Rs5,000 for subsequent 15 days. This has been a major source of revenue for the university for many years.The decision was taken during a meeting of NU’s Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) on Wednesday, which was the first online meeting held in its history. The same meeting also decided to extend last date for PhD thesis submissions if nationwide lockdown is extended beyond July 31.“The decision has been taken in the larger interest of the students. Since they’re not at fault, there’s no point in levying this hefty penalty on them. Coronavirus outbreak has led to an unprecedented crisis across all sectors, including education,” BOEE director Prafulla Sable told TOI.After the first phase, NU couldn’t conduct its second, third and fourth phase of examinations where nearly four lakh students are supposed to appear. “Those from third and fourth phases, which are major ones in terms of student numbers, were yet to fill the forms when nationwide lockdown was imposed. Now, they can fill up the forms as and when examinations schedule would be declared,” Sable said.The BOEE director informed that UGC had suggested starting the new academic year (2020-21) from August 1 for second, third and fourth year students.
