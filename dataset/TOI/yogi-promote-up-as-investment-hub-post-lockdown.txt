LUCKNOW: Industrialists and investors can look forward to easing of rules and concessions in policies as the government is preparing a industrial revival plan after the lockdown.

On Saturday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed the state’s industrial revival strategy and said UP should be promoted as an investment hub. Earlier, anticipating that several industries could move base to India, especially from China, the CM had directed officials to reach out to such firms.

“Investors should get the message that it will be beneficial to invest in UP. Strengthen existing units and bring to government’s notice any problems being faced by investors. There are huge possibilities in pharma sector. Explore the possibility of setting up a pharma park in Lucknow,” he said.

The CM has directed the industries department to revisit all policies to make them industry friendly. He has asked for labour laws to be improved and a specific policy on sick units to see if they can be revived. Asking for creation of a land bank to encourage investment, he also asked officials to work on land acquisition policy.

Industries commissioner Alok Tandon made a presentation before CM and said the government can also consider giving concessions in rules for restarting industries. He said in order to secure loans for industries, it would be necessary to communicate with banks and the Centre. “MSMEs will have to be encouraged for which there are several pending issues, like tax and compliances, approvals, financials and liquidity that need to be resolved,” he said.

Industries minister Satish Mahana also interacted with industrialists through a video conferencing organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce.
