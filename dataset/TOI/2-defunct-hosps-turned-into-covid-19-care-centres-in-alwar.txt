JAIPUR: A model has been prepared by district administration and doctors of Alwar for creating Covid-19 treatment facilities. Two private hospitals, which were lying defunct for years, have been identified by district administration and doctors of government and private sector and developed a separate facility for Covid-19 related treatment.


The district administration acquired two private hospitals to accommodate 20 beds for intensive care and 400 beds for quarantine facility. A meeting headed by Alwar district collector Indrajeet Singh attended by doctors from government and private sectors in which they decided to start 400-bed quarantine with 20-bed ICU.

“This is a unique model we have prepared in Alwar which should be replicated across the state. These are two hospitals which were shut down earlier and now government and private doctors have acquired it to develop it as a Covid-19 treatment centre,” said Dr M N Theraja, president (state) Indian Medical Association (IMA).

One of the two hospitals is 300-bed and the other has 100-bed capacity. The IMA advocated that inspite of admitting Covid-19 patients in every private hospital, the government should take measures to develop such facility for treatment and quarantine facility at one place which will minimise the chances of infecting other patients in other hospitals. The IMA advocated that the government and private sector should develop a facility where patients can get the treatment without affecting other services in other hospitals.
