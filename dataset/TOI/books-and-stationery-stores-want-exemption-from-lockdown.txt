Books and stationery stores want exemption from lockdown

Nagpur: Some book depot owners want an exemption from the lockdown as their products are also ‘essential’ for students. Demand for books and stationery is increasing, say depot owners due to the sudden, and now extended, lockdown.Anand Chopda, owner of Novelty Book Stores, said, “We are getting a lot of calls from parents who want to stock up on drawing books, notebooks and workbooks. They have run out of blank drawing books, some don’t have crayons or sketch pens necessary to keep kids engaged in this unique situation.”Chopda added that online PDF of books is only related to content, not for practice. “PDF of school related books is basically textbook, from which we read. But requirement is now of workbooks and blank notebooks in which kids can write and practice,” he said adding that many other book depot owners shared the view.Even after the partial opening up from April 20, book depots and stationery shops are not in the permitted list. Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (HA), feels that if safety can be adhered to then it might not be a bad idea. “Most important part is that we must comply with government’s guidelines, which currently includes a lot of restriction on movement of people. Onus will be on shop owners to ensure their customers follow social distancing,” said Mude.Chopda said the best solution could be to allow home delivery of books and other materials, thus avoiding crowds at the shop. Parents too agree this was a better solution. Amit Chhabra, a parent, said, “It will be good if such things can be home delivered. Stationery and book depots must be kept out of the lockdown.”
