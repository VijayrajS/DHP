HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to adopt quantitative easing (QE) and the effective use of ‘helicopter money’ to bail out states from the severe financial distress on account of Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown. 

The CM said both the Centre and states do not have revenues. “In April, instead of Rs 4,000 crore revenue, the state government got only Rs 100 crore. The Centre’s tax collections have also dwindled,” he said.

In a letter to the PM, the chief minister said the approach of QE was being followed by all major central banks in the world such as Federal Reserve Bank, European Central Bank and Bank of England. “We have requested the PM that the proposed QE should be at least 5% of GDP. As per the statistical office, the 2019-20 GDP of India is Rs 203.85 lakh crore and the QE at the rate works (at 5%) out to Rs 10.15 lakh crore,” the CM said.

KCR also urged the CM to extend corporate contribution to CMRF as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the lines of PM CARES Fund.
