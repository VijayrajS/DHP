HYDERABAD: Even as the Covid-19 threat looms large, anganwadi centres in state will continue to function until further orders. These centres supply cooked food to pregnant women and kids aged below six. 


Though almost all commercial and other establishments which witness public gatherings have been ordered to be closed until further orders, the state government has decided to keep the anganwadi centres open so that poor pregnant women, lactating mothers and children have access to nutritious food under the Arogya Laxmi scheme. 

Women and child development minister Satyavathi Rathod has directed the officials concerned to make all arrangements for sanitisation of anganwadi centres and ensure that personal hygiene of highest standards is maintained by the staff. “Pregnant women and children from poor background should continue to get cooked food from anganwadi centres as per chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s orders,” said the minister. 

Pregnant and lactating women get one full meal under Arogya Laxmi with one egg, 200 ml of milk, rice, dal and vegetable every day. Children in the age group of seven months to three years receive fortified ‘Balamrutham’ packet of 2½ kg and 16 eggs in a month. Those in 3-6 age group, as part of pre-school, get a hot meal of rice, dal, vegetables, egg, and nutri snacks/chana dal daily.

In view of the coronavirus scare, nursdery classes have been put off until further orders and only food is being supplied to the children.
