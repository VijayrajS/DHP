Lockdown pushes tribals to go back to roots, literally in Mysuru
2020-04-19
MYSURU: The Covid-19 outbreak has changed the menu of tribals in Mysuru district during the lockdown, which has cut off food supplies to them. This has pushed them to go back to their traditional food — tubers, various wild leafy vegetables, and wild fruits collected from forests. 

With no PDS supplies coming to their haadis (hamlets) ever since the lockdown was imposed, the tribals have taken to traditional way of searching food under the ground in and around forest areas. Vijaykumar, leader of Budakattu Krishikara Sangha in HD Kote, told TOI that tribals are visiting forest areas to find tubers, leafy vegetables and fruits. “This is because, they are not getting ration from the government. Even though they are getting enough food, this cannot be a solution because of the wild animals. Forest staff will arrest them,” he said. 

Tribal leaders have appealed to local political party functionaries, the deputy commissioner and the officers concerned to restore ration supplies at the earliest. Vijaykumar said that there are many tribals who have not got ration cards from the government. “They are being deprived of benefits extended by the government. As they are starving, the government must provide food to all families in haadis,” he said. 

S Srikanth, director of Hunsur-based NGO DEED (Development through Education), also endorsed Vijaykumar’s concerns.

There are 122 haadis in HD Kote taluk, 38 in Hunsur taluk, 32 in Periyapatna taluk and 5 in Nanjangud taluk coming under Bandipur and Nagarahole tiger reserves. A majority of families here are relying on the food collected from forest areas.
