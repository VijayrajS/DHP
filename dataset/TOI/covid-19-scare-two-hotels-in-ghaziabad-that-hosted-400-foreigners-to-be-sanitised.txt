Chief medical officer NK Gupta said the health department teams had visited the hotels on Sunday to gather information about these visitors. "Moreover, the hotel authorities have been instructed to carry out sanitisaton drives regularly," he added. 

As of now, the Ghaziabad health department has been able to track down 87 people, while the locations of 141 are yet to be traced. Officials said they were hopeful of tracking down all of them in a couple of days. They said the delay was mainly due to the absence of contact numbers of visitors. According to the officials, the list provided by the Centre mentions only the residential addresses on the passports. 

Meanwhile, the condition of both the 27-year-old patient tested positive at MMG District Hospital and that of the 38-year-old suspected patient at District Combined Hospital were found to be normal on Sunday.
