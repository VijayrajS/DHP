BHARUCH: Dr Mayank Pittaliya, a leading paediatrician of Bharuch, along with deputy engineer at Dakshin Gujarat Vij Nigam Vinod Shah, Asha worker Halimaben Patel of Amod, Sumitra Parmar of Alankar Row Houses and Umesh Prajapati of Sardar Nagar have been tested positive with Covid-19 in the last two days. Surprisingly out of five, three do not have any recent travel history. With the addition of these cases, the total cases at Bharuch reached 61, out of which four lost their lives, 36 were discharged and twenty people are taking treatment at Special Covid-19 Jayaben Modi Hospital at Ankleshwar. In a week's time, 20 new coronavirus-infected patients have been reported. 

Dr Pittalia has been practising in Bharuch for the past 30 years. ‘‘I do not have any recent travel history thus it seems that my case may be due to local transmission either through patients or friends and relatives with whom I was in contact in the past few days. My health is better but I am surprised that I was so conscious and had taken all the necessary precautions.After all it is all fate,’’ he told TOI. 

"The condition of all the 20 patients who are under the treatment at Covid-19 Jayaben Modi hospital are stable,’’ said Dr Nilesh Patel, district epidemic officer, Bharuch. “A sudden increase in the cases is due to more number of people coming from different parts of the state and other states as well. Bharuch health department has conducted 3,287 tests in last 45 days. People are not serious and thus the cases are expected to increase. Everyone is required to obey social distancing and wear masks," he added.
