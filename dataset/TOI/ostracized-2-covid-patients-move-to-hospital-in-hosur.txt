KRISHNAGIRI: Two Covid-19 patients were shifted to the ESI hospital in Hosur from home quarantine after they said they were ostracized by the fellow residents.


According to a source, the two, along with one of their friends, had come to the district from Maharashtra on Monday. “One of them is having an apartment in a gated community in Mathigiri near Hosur. As soon as they reached there, other residents alerted district health officials, who collected throat swabs and blood samples from them the same day.”

While two of them tested positive, they were allowed to remain in home quarantine as they were found to be healthy and asymptomatic. “Health officials have been visiting them twice a day and taking care of their medication and diet,” the source said.

Meanwhile, the patients informed the health officials that they were ostracized by the fellow residents and that members of the welfare association of the gated community had disallowed food delivery to their house.

The health officials took up the issue with deputy director of health Dr V Govindan, who held talks with the association members on Friday. “They said they have disallowed the food delivery and other services to the apartment out of fear of local transmission of the virus,” he told TOI.

The patients requested the official to shift them to a hospital. Subsequently, they were taken to the ESI hospital in Hosur the same evening.
