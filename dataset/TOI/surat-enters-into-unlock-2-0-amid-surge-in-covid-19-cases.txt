2020-06-08
SURAT: The number of Covid-19 cases kept mounting in Surat city with 62 more testing positive on Sunday, a day ahead of unlock 2.0 when hotels, malls, restaurants, religious places among others will be opened for public with laid down standard operating procedure (SOPs). 

The highest number of cases (17) were reported from Katargam zone followed by 12 in Limbayat (12), 11 in Varachha (A) and nine in Rander zone.

There has been a sharp rise in the number of positive cases after the lockdown was eased on June 1.

 “We have noticed that cases are continuously coming from containment zones which have been made to contain the virus spread. People in these zones are requested to stay at home and take more precautions,'' Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, Surat, said. 

Two persons also succumbed to the infection. SMC officials said that both were elders and suffering from co-morbid conditions. 

Meanwhile, about 55 Covid-19 patients were discharged on Sunday.

"I would like to tell those people taking the virus threat lightly that infection requires hospitalization if there are co-morbid conditions. In some cases, the stay in hospitals could be longer and there could be even deaths,” he said.

"From Monday onwards, the government has allowed hotels, restaurants and religious places to be opened outside the containment zones. Everyone has to follow the SPO issued by the government and SMC. Those areas where Covid-19 case is reported will be sealed,'' he added.
