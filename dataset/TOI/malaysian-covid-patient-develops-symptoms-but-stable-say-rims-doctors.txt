RANCHI: The 22-year-old Malaysian woman, who became Jharkhand’s first Covid-19 patient after she tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Tueday, is in stable condition despite developing a few symptoms of the viral infection on Wednesday night, a team of doctors treating her at the trauma centre of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) here said on Thursday. The woman was asymptomatic when she was tested at a Khelgaon-based quarantine centre.


Talking to TOI, Dr Devesh, a professor at the preventive and social medicine department at Rims, said, “On Wednesday night, she developed gastrointestinal disturbances and diarrhoea. However, she is responding well to the line of treatment and her condition in stable.”

Devesh, who is coordinating with other doctors of the novel coronavirus task force at Rims, added, “She also developed mild sneezing, but is not facing any breathing difficulties. The patient has a history of sinusitis. I have spoken to her doctor in Malaysia to get her medical history. Hopefully, she will recover soon.”

The patient’s husband and their four-year-old son, who accompanied her on the religious tour of Tablighi Jamaat, have been shifted to to the isolation centre of Rims as a precautionary measure. They will be re-tested for the infection within the next four to five days, officials said.

Dr Manoj Kumar, head of microbiology department at Rims, said no timeline can be given for a Covid-19 patient to develop symptoms. An infected person or those who come in contact with them can develop symptoms anytime during the 14-day quarantine period, he said. “To ascertain if anyone among those quarantined with the Malaysian woman is infected, we will make all of them, including her husband and child, undergo re-tests,” Kumar added.
