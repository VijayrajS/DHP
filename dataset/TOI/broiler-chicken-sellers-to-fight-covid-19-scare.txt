Broiler chicken sellers to fight Covid-19 scare
2020-03-08
Coimbatore: Hit badly by the rumours on social media that coronavirus spreads through chicken meat, broiler chicken farmers and merchants in the region are all set to take to advertisements to tell the public that they are just misleading information. They said the business has fallen by 50% and that the chicken meat price has dropped to Rs 100 per kg from Rs 170 around a month ago. The price of live chicken has also come down to Rs 40 per kg from Rs 80.M Kandasamy, president, Coimbatore District Broiler Merchants’ Association, said their business was not limited to the state but it also encompassed neighbouring states such as Kerala. “We usually sell around 45lakh kilos broiler chicken meat a month in Coimbatore district alone,” he said. However, the sales have dropped over the past one month, largely due to the rumours on social media. Pointing out that such messages were being circulated on social media for more than a month, A Pushparaj, secretary, Tirupur District Broiler Chicken Merchants’ Association, said, “We tried tracking 10 such messages. People who had shared the messages said they didn’t know whether there was any truth in the content. They just forwarded them. This has severely affected the business.” Broiler chicken farmers, merchants and other stakeholders from across the state met in the district on Saturday and discussed ways to tackle the situation. They said health minister C Vijayabaskar had informed that the coronavirus wouldn’t spread through broiler chicken. “We will now spread awareness through advertisements and messages that broiler chicken wouldn’t cause Covid-19.”
