HYDERABAD: Three new suspected cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reported in the city on Saturday and the patients have been kept in the isolation wards of Government Fever Hospital and Gandhi Hospital. With this, the total number of suspected cases in the state have gone up to 18.

While 11 patients have already tested negative for the virus, reports of seven samples are yet to be sent by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. The testing facility at the ICMR lab of Gandhi Medical College is likely to open on Monday as testing kits arrived a day back.


 

“The three new patients have a record of travelling to China. They have been kept in the isolation ward and samples have been collected for testing. We are hoping to get the reports in a day,” said Vijay Kumar, nodal officer for coronavirus.

Meanwhile, a massive exercise of training doctors, nurses, medical students and Class IV staff has begun at Gandhi Hospital and Gandhi Medical College to raise awareness on infection control. On Saturday, 40 doctors, house surgeons and nurses who work in the isolation facilities were given a refresher training, while 80 staffers including drivers and security personnel were trained on personal safety on Friday.

Though doctors already have necessary training, the exercise is being conducted in anticipation of an outbreak of 2019-nCoV. “The intention is to familiarise and train all frontline staff including security personnel, nurses and doctors on personal safety measures in case of infection outbreak,” said Dr Arjun Raj, who along with Dr Nikhat Shirin and Dr Nagamani, head of the microbiology department, conducted the programme.
