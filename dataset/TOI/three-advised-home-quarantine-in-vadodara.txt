2020-01-31
VADODARA: Three persons turned up at the SSG Hospital (SSG) on Thursday morning to get themselves tested as they had just returned from China. They did not show any symptoms hinting at a possible coronavirus infection and were advised home quarantine.

The hospital authorities were in for a surprise as three persons came in quick succession to get themselves examined. The three had visited China for official work and had landed at the Vadodara airport. From there, they went directly to SSGH for examination.

SSGH sources said that the three patients’ history was recorded in detail and they were examined. Since none of them had any symptoms like the coronavirus infection, they were allowed to go with instructions regarding the precautions they have to take. The instructions included staying in home quarantine.

Two of the three persons who had approached the SSG had gone for an official assignment for the company they worked for. “Due to the viral outbreak, the company asked us to return safely. We did not have any symptoms,” said one of two persons who came to the city via Mumbai.
