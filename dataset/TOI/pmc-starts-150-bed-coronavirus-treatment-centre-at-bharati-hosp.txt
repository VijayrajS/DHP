PUNE: Bharati medical college and hospital has volunteered to run 150-bed ‘Covid-19 treatment centre’ on its premises in Dhankawdi in association with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). 

“We have signed an MoU with PMC and pledged our 150 beds fully for isolation and treatment of suspected and positive patients of Covid-19. This will not hamper our other medical services. They will continue,” said hospital's medical director Sanjay Lalwani.

Hospital’s deputy medical director Jitendra Oswal said, “Our is the first private hospital to start Covid-19 treatment centre where isolation, testing and treatment will be offered to patients free of cost under PMC's or state government's health schemes.”

This is a 831-bed hospital. “The 150 Covid-19 treatment centre will be completely cordoned off from other beds. There are separate entry and exit ways to the centre as well as to the remaining part of the hospital where people of other ailments will be taken care of,” he said.

The district has started asking private intensivists and anaesthetists in Pune to start rendering medical services at Sassoon hospital. Confirming, eye surgeon Sanjay Patil, former president of IMA Pune, said, “About 15 intensivists and anaesthetists attached with private hospitals have been intimated to start rendering services at the Sassoon hospital where quite a few Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment. They have responded to the call."
