2020-05-25
LUCKNOW: A 91-year-old woman, who is the oldest Covid-19 patient in Uttar Pradesh, has defeated the infection after undergoing treatment for 23 days at the Rajdhani Covid-19 Hospital of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS).


Medical superintendent, SGPGI, Dr RK Singh said the patient was admitted to a private hospital and had developed fever, cough, expectoration and breathlessness on April 26. When her condition did not improve, she was shifted to SGPGI on April 30. The same day she tested positive to Covid-19. “Age is a risk factor. The elderly woman had history of hypertension. The main challenges in treating her included maintaining her organ functions at optimal level,” he said. 

“Prevention of organ dysfunction and avoiding ventilation were major challenges because removal from ventilator would have been very difficult,” he said. “The patient required oxygen support for prolonged period after which she achieved stability,” Dr Singh said. State surveillance officer Vikasendur Agarwal said: “The number of elderly taking ill in UP is very low. As on date, about 6% of the patients belong to 60-plus age group, but 90-plus is surely rare.” 

He added that the case exemplifies that timely medical intervention is crucial to saving one's life.
