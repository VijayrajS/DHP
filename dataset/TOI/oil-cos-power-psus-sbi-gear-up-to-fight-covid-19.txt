2020-04-02
Kolkata: Oil marketing companies like Indian Oil (IOC), BPCL and HPCL have initiated measures for its employees and associates following coronavirus outbreak. Oil PSUs — ONGC and IOC — contributed Rs 300 crore and Rs 225 crore, respectively, to the PM Cares Fund. Other PSUs — Power Finance Corporation, NTPC and NHPC — have put in a total of Rs 1,125 crore.

SBI employees pledged Rs 100 crore to the PM Cares Fund. The 2.6 lakh employees will contribute their two days’ salary. This is perhaps one of the biggest commitments by employees of an organisation. Last week, the PSU bank had announced a commitment of 0.25% of its FY20 profit in support of Covid-19 control.

An OMC spokesperson said: “Personnel like LPG showroom staff, godown-keepers, LPG mechanics and LPG delivery boys, retail outlet customer attendants, truck drivers, including bulk/pack transporters, are risking their lives to ensure delivery of fuel to customers and fellow citizens. As a goodwill gesture and in recognition of the services rendered in these difficult times, an ex-gratia amount of Rs five lakh has been announced in case of death of any above-mentioned personnel due to COVID-19.”

Besides, IndianOil’s retail outlet Kanchanjungha Service Station in Jalpaiguri District distributed rice, groceries and vegetables to local tea garden workers and labourers as the Cover-19 crisis has brought the region to a halt.

The entire workforce of ONGC is functioning 24x7 to ensure production and delivery of oil and gas. Employees are working from home through video conferencing to provide necessary support to the employees who are performing their duties on extended stay in the field.

“I am confident that we, the 30,100-strong ONGC community, shall together tide over this hard time and keep the ONGC flag flying high,” said its CMD Shashi Shanker.
