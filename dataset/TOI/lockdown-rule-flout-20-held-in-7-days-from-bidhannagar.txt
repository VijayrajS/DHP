Lockdown rule flout: 20 held in 7 days from Bidhannagar
2020-04-09
KOLKATA: Three Covid-19 suspects from different parts of Salt Lake are undergoing treatment in hospitals and hundreds have been kept in isolation, but that is still not proving to be a deterrent for some people to go out without any emergency. The Bidhannagar City Police has arrested around 20 people in the past week for violating the lockdown, with most arrests from Lake Town and Baguiati. 

The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation is concerned that a section of people was going out just to have a stroll or meet neighbours for a road-side adda near the market complexes in different blocks. Some even move from one block to another on bikes and cars. “We are requesting people not to leave their homes unless it is absolutely necessary,” said an officer. 

“There still seems to be a lack of awareness over the issue,” said a civic official. 

All 41 councillors of the civic body have been instructed to carry on awareness campaigns daily in their respective wards this week.
