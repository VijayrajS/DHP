‘Strict’ Secunderabad Cantonment Board keeps coronavirus at bay
2020-05-05
SECUNDERABD: Secunderabad Cantonment Board the country’s second largest cantonment board has reported only two coronavirus cases. No deaths linked to the pandemic have been reported from the area as well.

The SCB officials attribute this success to five factors : effective sanitisation, social distancing, restriction of street vendors, creating awareness among the citizens and most importantly, effective implementation of the lockdown.

The 430-odd resident welfare associations played a key role in preventing spread of the virus. Despite having just two positive cases, third phase of disinfection in the area is underway.

“We are sanitizing every bylane by spraying disinfectant and DDT power with the help of 10 specially designed vehicles. Our sanitation employees are working very hard. We have also used drones, 40 hand pumps and fire engines to cover lakes and other major junctions. So far, we have used 1,000 litres of sodium hypochlorite ,” said SCB senior superintendent (SWM), M Devender. 

The official said that SCB is strictly implementing social distancing at shops and market. “We have been strictly enforcing the three-metre distance rule at grocery shops, vegetable markets and butcher shops. We have even penalised the shopkeepers who violated the social distancing rule,” Devender said.

By using public address systems, SCB is educating citizens on the need to follow preventive measures to combat the virus. The SCB official credited 1,000 sanitation workers, who are involved in keeping roads clean and clearing garbage.

Though SCB is a deemed municipality which comes under the ministry of defence, we have been quite effective, compared to GHMC, our neighbouring civic body
