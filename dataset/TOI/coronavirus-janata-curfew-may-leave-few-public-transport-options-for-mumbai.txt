Shashank Rao of Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union said, “Many aumay voluntarily stay away as there will hardly be any business and very few commuters on roads. Unions have not called for any bandhbut drivers will take their own call.”

A L Quadros of Mumbai Taximen’s Union said there will be just 15% kaali peelis on roads. “Our cabbies have locked their vehicles and many have gone to their native places. We have appealed to traffic police to allow us to park vehicles on roads as there is no business,” he said.
