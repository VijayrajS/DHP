Jewellery makers see silver lining post Covid-19
2020-04-29
Coimbatore: Though they are out of business right now, gold jewellery manufacturers and goldsmiths in the district expect the post-Covid-19 phase to be a very positive one.

As investments in equity have come down amid the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, investment trend will shift towards gold, they said. The sector will see an upward trend once the crisis passes and businesses and logistics resume normalcy.

According to projections, six months from now, the price of gold might touch 64,000 per sovereign. On Monday, gold prices stood at 4,500 per gram, around 36,000 per sovereign. 

As per analyses of investment firms such as Bank of America Securities, an ounce of gold will be worth $3,000 next year. By then, the price of one gram gold in India will touch 8,000, said president of the Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers Association B Muthu Venkatraman. “Investment in equity has gone down. For another six months to one year, we can’t expect investment in shares to go up. Industry is also facing a crisis. The only sector that is holding up is agriculture. Considering all these, we can say investors will turn towards gold, boosting its prices,” he told TOI.

President of the Coimbatore Goldsmiths’ Association S M Kamal Hasan agreed. “Investors will obviously turn towards gold. Those who have already invested in it or invest in it now stand to gain. In the coming months, we expect the gold price to rise by 30%.” 

As many as 85,000 people involved in gold jewellery value chain in the district are holding on to this hope. The district had 5,000 gold jewellery manufacturers, who cater to jewellery outlets. The manufacturers outsource gold jobwork to 40,000 smaller goldsmithies.
