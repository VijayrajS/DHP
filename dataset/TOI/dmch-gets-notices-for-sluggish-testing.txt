DMCH gets notices for ‘sluggish’ testing
2020-04-14
DARBHANGA: The state health department has issued show-cause notices to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for slow pace of Covid-19 testing. The testing for Covid-19 had started at DMCH on April 2. 

The first show-cause notice was issued to the head of hospital’s microbiology department Dr Ramashanka Prasad on April 8 and the second to principal Dr H N Jha on Sunday. The two show-cause notices were served by the undersecretary of the state health department Vivekanand Thakur.

The show-cause notice served on DMCH principal Dr Jha reads, “The directive for sending test report through specified e-mail is not being followed properly, making it difficult for the department to prepare the integrated report on the pandemic.”

DMCH sources said after the health department’s tough stand, the number of tests at the hospital increased from 4 on first day and 24 on second day to 72 on Sunday.
