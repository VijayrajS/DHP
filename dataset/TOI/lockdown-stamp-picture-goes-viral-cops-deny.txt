KOLKATA: The photograph of a man’s hand, which was claimed to have been stamped by cops at a police station in southeast Kolkata, went viral on social media on Wednesday, triggering a huge sensation among netizens. 


The stamped hand photograph raised curiosity among people, some of whom seemed convinced that the police had put the stamp on people as a sign of warning against not staying indoors and venturing out. However, senior police officers at Lalbazar denied any such action on their part and called it fake news. 

Adding more to people’s speculation, some sources in the south east division said that cops would not arrest twice the person with stamp on his hand for defying the lockdown. It was also claimed that the stamp would help the police ascertain the person’s movement back home after being released on bail. The police officers rubbished the claim.

“No such instruction was passed on to the police stations from Lalbazar. There are several other practical methods of policing for the present time of crisis,” said joint CP (headquarters), Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. According to sources, cops are taking several measures to ensure that none is harassed unduly for flouting the lockdown norms. 

“Some small steps have been taken to ensure that two police stations will not take action against the same person. These measures will also act as warning and we can spot the repeat offenders,” said an officer from south east division.
