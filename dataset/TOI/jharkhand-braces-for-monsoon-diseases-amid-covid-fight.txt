Jharkhand braces for monsoon diseases amid Covid fight
2020-06-05
RANCHI: The state health department has decided to launch a surveillance programme from June 15 to check the spread of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) like dengue, malaria and chikungunya. 

A letter in this regard was issued by state health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni on Wednesday directing all deputy commissioners and civil surgeons to submit an action plan with the department by June 10.

Talking to TOI, Kulkarni said: “As cases of vector-borne diseases spike during the monsoon, we have decided to start a surveillance programme. At a time when the number of Covid-19 patients is going up, we want to minimise the impact of other diseases.”

Kulkarni added, “We have identified three hospitals as centres for treatment of VBDs and have directed all district VBD cells to form a task force for surveillance. The task force will include multi-purpose workers, employees of urban malaria scheme, filaria control unit and volunteers who will conduct door-to-door surveys to identify breeding spots in urban areas.” 

On being asked about districts with high incidence of VBDs, state entomologist Sagya Singh said: “High prevalence of VBDs is mostly seen in urban areas like Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Gumla. This year, we will deploy around 300 workers for the surveillance programme and begin fogging exercises in urban areas in collaboration with the civic bodies.”
