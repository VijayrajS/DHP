Trichy: The alumni of National Institute of Technology (NIT) Trichy have been involved in curbing the effects of Covid-19 in various capacities inside the country as well as abroad. 

Apart from early detection, facility management and provision of face masks, they have been supporting people in the lower strata of society who are the worst affected by the pandemic. Stempeutics, an Indian stem cell company with NIT Trichy alumnus B N Manohar as CEO, has tied up with the global consortium of stem cell companies to come out with a potent drug for end-stage coronavirus patients. 

He said his company will be supplying clinical-grade MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells: multipotent stem cells found in the bone marrow that are important for making and repairing skeletal tissues). Similarly, to cater to the oxygen requirement of multiple patients, Admiral superintendent Sreekumar Nair and his team from Naval Dockyard Visakhapatnam have designed an innovative “'portable multi-feed oxygen manifold (MOM)”' using a six-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder.

R B Ramesh, founder of New Life Trust, Chengalpet, and his friends have been providing groceries to daily wagers, civil workers, migrant labourers, tribal and leprosy families besides supplying water bottle and biscuits to police personnel in and around the district. NIT director Mini Shaji Thomas while appreciating their efforts said the alumni have also contributed to managing the crisis outside the country. 

S K Ramesh, director of AIMS2 programme at California state university, Northridge, responded through Bingbing Li, a faculty member, for the manufacture of PPE for first responders and frontline workers in Los Angeles. Under the leadership of Madhumohan Sreeram, chief innovation officer of Dulsco, a system for mass disinfection of the community was demonstrated to the municipality of Dubai and put into action the same day.
