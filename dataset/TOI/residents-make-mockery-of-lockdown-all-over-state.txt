How residents made mockery of lockdown all over Rajasthan
2020-03-24
JAIPUR: A day after the state government imposed a total lockdown and promulgated Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent gathering of more than five people to check the spread of coronavirus, people made a mockery of the directive on Monday as they huddled together at various places to gossip and attend feasts.


Throughout the day, people were seen loitering on the roads, crowding at grocery stores and attending community feasts.

Though police intervened at various places to disperse them, its effort hardly made much difference as the ‘janata’ defied the ‘curfew’.

Bharatpur police came down heavily on people who organized a shradh ceremony. “We were told that some people were organising the ceremony at Kanwara village under Kaman police station area of our district. Our team rushed to the spot and stopped the event,” said a senior cop.
