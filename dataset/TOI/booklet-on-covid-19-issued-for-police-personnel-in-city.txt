Nashik: The city police has come out with a booklet on coronavirus for its employees amid the outbreak of Covid-19.

Police have to be on the street continuously hence they will have to take utmost precaution while dealing with the public.

DCP (HQ and Traffic) Pournima Chaugule, who has compiled the booklet along with her subordinates, said, “Though we had decided to circulate printed copies of the booklet, we will circulate the soft copies to the police personnel to avoid any kind of transmission of the virus.”

 The booklet can also be useful for the public as they will know more about the viral disease and how one can safeguard himself or herself from it.

Apart from the general information about Covid 19, the booklet has specific instructions to the police on how they should take precautions when they are dealing with the general public, when they check vehicles going to hospitals (as part of their duty), and also the precautions they should be take when coming back to home from work.

Like the doctors, nurses and other health workers, police personnel also are in close contact with a large number of people. 

People not adhering to the instructions during the lockdown is adding more burden on the police. 

Hence, the booklet which has been issued is also for their safety.

Police personnel have expressed satisfaction over the information they have received through the booklet and it is also useful for their family members.

A constable, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We are currently doing an unusual work of not letting people move out in groups or individuals venturing out of their houses unnecessarily. Though we are trying to take care of ourselves in the best possible way, we could get the best possible help from citizens if they remained confined in their houses until the Covid-19 scare is gone.”
