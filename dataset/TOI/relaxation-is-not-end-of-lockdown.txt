2020-04-26
Rajkot: While the lock down will be rigorously implemented, shops will be allowed to open in Rajkot from Sunday onwards in accordance with government guidelines. 

On Saturday, Rajkot police commissioner, Manoj Agarwal, warned residents that the relaxation to open shops and business establishments do not mean that people can move about on the roads. 

Following the central government notification declaring relaxation to small shopkeepers, Rajkot people thronged roads merrily on Saturday morning . 

Shops in old Rajkot areas like Lakhaji Raj Road, Dharmendra Road, Sadar Palace Road opened shutters and people started gathering there. With that, even a few jewellers were also back in their shops. 

Finally, cops had to crack the whip on these shopkeepers asking them to down shutters and also disbursed the mob. 

“The rules of lock down will be followed strictly, one should not take the liberty of roaming around,” warned Agarwal, while stating that police are alert about the state government’s relaxation order for shopkeepers. 

People from one area cannot go to another to buy anything, while only one person will be allowed to commute on a two wheeler and two people in a four wheeler.
