Pune: The Kondhwa police on Friday night offered dinner and ration to a Mozambique national after he left his rented residence in a state of distress due to financial constraints arising from the spread of coronavirus.Mbalate Junior Arao, a final year student of mechanical engineering at a city college, visited the Kondhwa police station and appealed to the officers to provide him a meal because he had no money to purchase food.Sub-inspector Santosh Shinde from Kondhwa police station told TOI, “Arao came with his luggage around 10pm and told us that he had left his residence because it had become difficult for him to survive without money as he was not getting help from his acquaintances. He was looking restless and hunger-struck. We connected with an online aggregator and supplied him food. We also provided him ration for around 10 days.”Shinde said, “We summoned his broker and asked him to refund an advance of Rs1,500 to Arao so he can meet his expenses.”
