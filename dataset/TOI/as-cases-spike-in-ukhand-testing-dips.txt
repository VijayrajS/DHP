As cases spike in U’khand, testing dips
2020-06-07
Dehradun: Even as the Covid-19 tally in the state has crossed over 1,300, the total number of samples being tested has come down drastically — from around 800 to 1,000 daily to hardly 500 a day.

According to data released by the health department, around 800 to 1,000 samples were collected daily between May 22 and June 2. However, the sample testing has seen a sharp dip to around 500 a day for the last three days, even though the number of Covid-19 cases being reported is in double digits daily. While 587 new samples were collected for testing on Saturday, the number was 566 on Friday and 571 on Thursday.

Health watchers claimed that this is a worrying sign as testing aggressively is the need of the hour especially with fears that the infection has reached the community transmission stage.

The state’s Covid-19 tally has seen a steep rise from 111 cases on May 19 to 1,300 on Saturday — a period which is just a little over a fortnight.

Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based research organisation, Social Development for Communities Foundation, said, “The health department was testing over 1,000 samples regularly between May 22 and June 2. As many as 1,588 new samples were collected on May 31, which is highest so far. However, while cases are rising, the testing has gone down.” 

“While Uttarakhand, with a population of over 1 crore, has collected 36,638 samples so far and tested 28,172 of them, neighbouring Himachal, with a much lesser population, has collected around 44,500 samples and managed to test 43,671 of them,” he added.

Nautiyal further said that Uttarakhand’s sample testing is far lesser than Himachal despite having more labs than the latter. While Uttarakhand has five government labs, a private lab in Dehradun and a tie-up with a Chandigarh-based facility, Himachal has only five government labs for testing Covid-19 samples.

Meanwhile, state health secretary Amit Negi said that both testing and sampling are being done regularly in the state. 

“We are regularly testing 1,000 cases and collecting equal number of samples. The sample collection numbers have dipped in the last two to three days just to clear the backlog. Our target is to test at least 1,500 people everyday. This will pick pace by next week,” he added.

Meanwhile on Saturday, 89 people tested positive for the virus. With this, the total number of Covid cases has touched 1,300. Also, 79 patients recovered from the infection the same day, taking the total number of recovered patients to 423.
