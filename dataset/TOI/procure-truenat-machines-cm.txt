2020-05-08
PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday ordered expeditious procurement of TrueNat machines and their installation in all district hospitals for speedy coronavirus test results. The machine yields the result in less than an hour if it is negative, and in the case of positive case, it requires cross-checking with the other method.


The CM, who held a meeting to review measures being taken for containment of coronavirus outbreak, said the arrangements should be made to give proper training to the personnel involved in conducting the test through the TrueNat machine.

The CM also ordered that the required arrangements be made for the start of random testing for coronavirus infection in all the 38 districts. The CM said that the twin measures would help not only in the containment of the coronavirus spread, but also build the confidence and faith of the people in the system.

The CM asked chief secretary Deepak Kumar to ensure that the holding capacities of the block and panchayat level quarantine centres are increased.
