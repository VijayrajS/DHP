Ramayapalli village shows the way to tackle Covid-19
2020-06-12
Hyderabad: Residents of Ramayapalli village in Medak district have come up with a unique idea of spreading awareness among villagers about Covid-19—tying a protective mask on Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the village. 

The statue is located in the centre of the village, which has a population of around 3,000. Village elders regularly gather near the statue to discuss important matters and take key decisions. “After the lockdown was announced, villagers were not aware of the preventive measures they need to take to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and would venture out without masks. The elders then came up with the idea as it will remind the people to wear masks,” N Srisailam, a resident of the village, told TOI. The idea was discussed after migrant labourers working in other states began returning to the village. 

“People do not listen easily, but they slowly began realising the importance of taking preventive measures after seeing the statue with a mask,” another villager said.

The village sarpanch has also distributed washable masks to the villagers. “The police also visit the village regularly to see if people are following the new rules,” he said.

Meanwhile, activists are urging the government to encourage sarpanches and leaders of local village bodies to track the movement of migrant workers and others returning to their villages. “Odisha government has directed the sarpanches to ensure that they track migrants, send them to quarantine and conduct tests. Similar efforts here will give good results,” K Vindhya , an activist working with migrant workers, said.
