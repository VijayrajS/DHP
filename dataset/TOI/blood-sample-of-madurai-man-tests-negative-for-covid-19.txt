The blood sample was sent to King Institute of Preventive Medicine in Chennai.“We don’t have any cause for alarm now. We will be treating him like a regular patient now for his breathing difficulty and respiratory illness,” said GRH dean Dr J Sangumani. Health officials said the man’s health was improving and he would soon be shifted to the general ward. The man was admitted to the COVID-19 isolation ward on Wednesday evening with symptoms of wheezing, which doctors had said indicated asthma. Since the man had recently returned from Singapore, his sample was sent for testing and he was admitted to the isolation ward only as a precaution.Meanwhile, health officials have urged the public not to panic at any time and to keep practising hand and cough hygiene. “There is no cause for concern in Madurai. The monitoring of home quarantined persons and screening processes at Madurai airport continue,” said a senior health official. tnn
