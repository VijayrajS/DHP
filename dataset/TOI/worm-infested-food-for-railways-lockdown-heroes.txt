Worm-infested food for railways’ lockdown heroes
2020-04-29
Nagpur: Lockdown heroes — loco pilots, assistants and guards — transporting essential commodities by operating freight trains during Covid-19 got a bitter taste of railway hospitality when they were served chapatis made out of worm-infested flour on Tuesday morning.

The aggrieved front-line staff lodged a complaint in the book at the running room (Triveni) at Cotton Market Road, where they were served food. There were 11 staffers at the running room of which five were at the dining table while others were resting after night duty.

At 10.30am, while eating food a loco pilot saw a live insect creeping on the chapati in the plate. One of the chapatis had a worm in it. When a couple of loco pilots went into the kitchen they noticed the wheat flour had many worms. The manager of the running room also saw the insects.

All were shocked and called up in-charge loco inspector Gopal Rai. Five staffers had already consumed the food and were resting. They were restless after seeing the insects. However, by the time Rai reached the spot, the workers of the private contractor had thrown away the entire flour.

Assistant commercial manager & Nagpur Central Railway spokesperson SG Rao said, “Strict action will be taken against the contractor for the mess. Now only 5kg wheat flour packets will be made available at the running room. Actually, owing to lockdown, occupancy at the running room is reduced to 20%. All old food material in the kitchen has been removed now.” 

“The incident exposes tall claims of Indian Railways that it is taking utmost care of its employees during lockdown. The loco pilots and guards are working day and night to serve the nation during Covid-19, and they certainly don’t deserve such shabby treatment,” said SK Shukla, central vice-president of All India Guards Council (AIGC).
