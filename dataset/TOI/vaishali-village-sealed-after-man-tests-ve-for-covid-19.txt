PATNA: The Vaishali district administration on Thursday sealed Raghopur Purbi village, around 30km southeast of Hajipur, a day after a 35-year-old man from the village tested positive for Covid-19. Movement of people was also restricted at the village. Though the infected man is undergoing treatment in Patna, his 62 close relatives and neighbours were quarantined at Hajipur, district magistrate Udita Singh said.

The village falls under the assembly constituency of leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “The village has been sealed and police personnel with magistrates deployed. People have been asked to remain indoors and follow the lockdown norms,” Hajipur SDO Sandip Shekhar Priyadarshi said.

A joint team of officials led SDO Priyadarshi and SDPO Raghav Dayal visited the village on Thursday and took stock of the situation. “Altogether 59 people have been sent to the Sadar hospital at Hajipur and subsequently quarantined for 14 days. Their samples have been collected and sent to Patna for test. Efforts are on to locate others who had come in contact with the patient,” SDPO Dayal said.

The local mukhiyas and other people’s representatives have also been asked to provide help to inhabitants of the village. “Essential commodities will be provided to the villagers by the government agency. Entry of the outsiders has been completely been banned. Those trying to defy lockdown will face action,” the SDPO said.

Vaishali district RJD president Baidyanath Chandravanshi, however, exuded confidence that the joint efforts of the district administration and the locals will help contain the virus. “We are in touch with our workers in the village,” he added.

A senior district official said the village would be sanitised in a day or two.
