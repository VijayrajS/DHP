Before leaving Bengaluru, he had undergone a covid test at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital and was awaiting the result. When he was about to leave for Belagavi after meeting his friends at Hubballi and Dharwad, a caller from a Bengaluru hospital informed the officer about the him testing positive for Covid 19 and asked him to get admitted at KIMS in Hubballi. 

The district administration has instructed five persons including an SI in the twin cities who had come in primary contact of the officer to be home quarantined. Since the SI had also visited the suburban police station in Dharwad, the station was sanitized on Thursday. The swab samples of the sub inspector of suburban police station were sent for testing the result is awaited.

She developed Influenza like illness (ILI) and was admitted at KIMS. She is a teacher at an English medium school in Fort area of Dharwad.
