2020-03-21
Hyderabad: A resident of Banjara Hills, who has been in home quarantine after he returned from South Africa, made a distress call to Hyderabad police after some members of his apartment locked him to make sure he cannot come out of his house. 

“Residents in my building have locked my apartment from outside assuming that I am carrying the coronavirus, though I have no symptoms,” he said on his Twitter handle. 

He said that when he called the police, they came to his residence but they allegedly did not take action. However, when Banjara Hills inspector Kalinga Rao was contacted, he said, “An argument took place and someone locked his house from outside to make sure he cannot come out. We told that if they have any problem they should contact the police, and not lock him.”

The other residents took objection, when they noticed that the person, who is under house quarantine, was planning to go out. 

Meanwhile in LB Nagar, a person who came from Dubai and reached Hyderabad after visiting Mumbai was not allowed to ply in a bus. The co-passengers took objection and the police shifted him to Gandhi hospital for medical examination. On Friday, West Zone police, revenue and health department officials found 11 Kyrgyzstan nationals in self-quarantine in a place of worship at Mellapally with no symptoms of coronavirus.
