Hyderabad: AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken ‘the country for a ride’ as far as the management of the Covid-19 situation was concerned and has completely failed in controlling the spread of the virus. 

“Protect yourself from the virus, don’t keep hopes on Modi ji, he will not save you from the virus. People clapped hands, lit diyas, stood on the terrace to clap, burnt crackers and resorted to so many such activities, did these activities contain the spread of the virus? Modi Ji has taken you for a ride,” said Owaisi, while addressing a press conference. 

On the China issue, he said that the Centre must tell the people about the talks with China. “The home minister and the defense minister can easily tell the nation what exactly they are discussing with the Chinese, why are they embarrassed?” he said. The MP also distributed 227 sanitiser dispensers to representatives of temples, mosques, churches and gurudwaras in the city.
