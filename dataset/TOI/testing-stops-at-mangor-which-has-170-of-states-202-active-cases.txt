2020-06-07
Panaji: Even as chief minister Pramod Sawant said last week that his government would test every single person at Mangor Hill, the containment zone witnessed no testing for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Since the first two cases in the area were reported on Monday, Mangor Hill now accounts for 170 of the state’s 202 active cases.

The state saw its biggest spike in cases on Saturday, with 71 new cases, 62 of which pertain to Mangor Hill. On Thursday, the zone’s last day of testing, 955 swab samples were taken. Apart from Sawant, health secretary Nila Mohanan too had said that all persons in the area would be tested. She had said that the health department’s focus would be on Mangor Hill.

The Covid hospital in Margao, which is treating all the state’s cases of the novel coronavirus, is now 92% full, with 202 of the 220 beds occupied. The state government is “seriously considering” taking over one or more hospitals to cope with the demand. South Goa collector Ajit Roy said that the plan is to take over government hospitals and resources first, before any private facilities. “We will first use the government hospitals,” he said. “Some hospitals have been identified, but a final decision is yet to be taken.”

A few private hospitals were shortlisted in the initial phases of the Covid-19 battle, but since the initial phases of lockdown didn’t see too many cases in Goa, the plan was deferred. Sources said that talks are underway with owners of private hospitals, and a decision to take them over could be taken “anytime soon”. “We have the plan in place,” said deputy director of health services Dr Ira Almeida. “However, the decision of taking over more hospital/s rests with the government.”

Testing at Mangor Hill came to a standstill on Friday. after seven health workers deployed there tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Then, the urban health centre, Vasco, shut down its operations since 16 of its staffers were working in the containment zone. Sources said that a huge backlog of cases may have held to the halt in testing. However, Mohanan said that the department has enough trained people to take swabs, but didn’t specify the exact number.

While there was no collection of swabs, the Chicalim sub-district hospital started a two-hour OPD at Mangor Hill from 10am to 12 noon on Saturday. Those who complained of cold and fever were checked, and medicines dispensed. “Our OPD will run from 10am to 12 noon and will check people for various physical conditions,” said the hospital’s health officer, Dr Rajendra Borkar.

Mormugao deputy collector Sachin Dessai told TOI that testing at Mangor Hill could resume on Monday. However, on Sunday, the Goa Ayurvedic Medical Association, approved by the Union Ayush ministry, will start distributing Ayurvedic medicines to boost immunity, he said.

After Friday’s chaos (reported on TOI’s edition dated June 6), things seemed to have settled down on Saturday. “People are relaxed today (Saturday) after the health facility was made available to them,” said Mormugao Municipal Council councillor Yatin Kamurlekar. “The OPD will function for one hour at the BSNL junction near Chota Mangor, and for another hour near the gurudwara at Bada Mangor.” He also said that swab collection will henceforth be done on larger premises, which can accommodate 200 persons.

From Saturday, a Kadamba bus has been stationed at the containment zone to move patients to hospital in case of emergency. “The bus will be stationed there 24x7,” Dessai said.

Goa currently conducts 1,500-2,000 tests a day, and has substantially ramped up its testing capacity since last month after machines were added at the district and subdistrict hospitals, as well as one at GMC’s virology lab. Of the 2,311 samples tested on Saturday, 1,389 tested negative. 851 reports are awaited.

Besides the Mangor Hill cases, Saturday saw nine travellers also test positive for Covid-19. Three of them arrived by air from Delhi, three by train from Maharashtra, and three by road. The day also saw 12 suspects admitted in isolation wards, 235 international and 262 inter-state passengers placed in home quarantine, and seven placed in facility quarantine.
