Glenmark to test efficacy of 2 antiviral drugs for treating Covid
2020-05-27
MUMBAI: Glenmark Pharma announced a new randomised, open-label study to test the combined efficacy of two antiviral drugs, Favipiravir and Umifenovir, as a potential Covid-19 treatment strategy. Glenmark has received approval from regulator, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to initiate the study, called the FAITH trial, under which 158 hospitalized patients with moderate Covid-19 will be enrolled. 


The company statement also says that antivirals with different mechanisms of action could complement and enhance efficacy against Covid-19. Glenmark is also continuing with the Phase-III clinical trials for Covid-19 patients with antiviral Favipiravir monotherapy. Early treatment with combination therapy will be evaluated for safety and efficacy, as it is emerging as an effective approach in shortening duration of virus shedding and facilitating early discharge of patients, the company says. 


Monika Tandon, VP & head, clinical development global specialty/branded portfolio, Glenmark said, “Combining antiviral agents that have a good safety profile and act on different stages of viral life-cycle is an effective treatment approach to rapidly suppress initial high viral load and lead to overall improvement in clinical parameters. We consider Glenmark’s study will be pivotal in leading to identification of highly effective and safe treatments against Covid-19 in India. Beyond its many potential patient treatment benefits, we also hope the combination therapy will reduce infection risk amongst medical professionals and healthcare workers by reducing the duration of virus shedding from treated patients.”

Favipiravir is an anti-viral drug approved in Japan for treating influenza, including those that are oseltamivir-resistant, and trials are on globally to study its effectiveness and efficacy in treating Covid-19 patients.
