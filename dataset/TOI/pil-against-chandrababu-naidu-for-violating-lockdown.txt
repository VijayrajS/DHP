PIL against Chandrababu Naidu for violating lockdown
2020-05-27
VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Tuesday heard a PIL petition filed by Vanga Venkata Rami Reddy, a practicing advocate, against former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s visit to Amaravati. The petitioner contended that Naidu and his son Nara Lokesh went to Amaravati from Hyderabad in a convoy.

“They made several halts at NH-65 where hundreds of party workers gathered without wearing masks or maintaining social distance. Instead of stopping party workers, Naidu encouraged them by coming out of his car and showing them victory sign. Gathering of people at this point of time violates lockdown norms and is a crime under the Epidemic Act,” Rami Reddy said, and urged the high court to direct the police to book cases against Naidu and his son for risking the lives of so many people.

The central government’s guidelines on Covid-19 pandemic mandates maintaining social distancing and bans public congregations, Rami Reddy said. He also accused the police of inaction because they allegedly did not do anything to disperse the crowd. State home secretary, health secretary, DGPs of both Telugu states, Union home ministry, Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh have been made respondents in the petition.
