Turned away by BMHRC, gas victim dies of Covid-19
2020-05-12
BHOPAL: He was taken to three major government hospitals of the city — JP Hospital, Hamidia and BMHRC — six times in the course of three days. Each time he was denied admission. By the time Hamidia Hospital put him in the Covid-19 ward on the night of May 4, it was too late. Anwar Ahmed didn’t live to see the next morning.

The 44-year-old is the 20th gas tragedy victim to die. As in most of the other cases, his Covid-19 report arrived after he had died. That’s not the only grim similarity. Most of the other gas victims who died had been turned away by several hospitals.

Anwar would have been one of the youngest survivors of the gas tragedy of 1984 that took nearly 3,800 lives and left 5.5 lakh with lifelong ailments.

Anwar’s son Almas choked up as he narrated their desperate but futile attempts to get him admitted.

“It was the afternoon of May 2. My father complained of severe chest pain. We called a 108 ambulance and went to JP Hospital, where he was admitted for a few hours for an ECG. The doctor told us that he had suffered a minor heart attack, gave us some medicines, and referred him to Hamidia Hospital,” Almas told TOI on Monday.

JP Hospital gave them an ambulance, but in Hamidia, they had to wait another five hours before he was examined. “After an X-ray, a doctor said he didn’t have Coronavirus symptoms and that the ECG was a “little erratic”. He advised us to take him home,” aid Almas.

Anwar’s brother-in-law, who had joined them by now, advised them to take him to BMHRC. Since he is a gas victim, he won’t have a problem getting treatment there, he said.

To their shock, at the BMHRC gates, the family was asked to show “final compensation” judgment of the court to verify that he was a gas victim, said Almas.
