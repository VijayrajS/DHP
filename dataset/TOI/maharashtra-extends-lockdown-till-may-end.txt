Maharashtra extends lockdown till May-end
2020-05-18
MUMBAI: Maharashtra on Sunday extended the Covid-19 lockdown for the fourth consecutive period till the month-end.



Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta issued the order, directing all state departments to keep strictly implementing the Covid-induced lockdown rules issued so far. The order clarified that calibrated, phase-wise relaxation or lifting of the lockdown order would be “notified in due course”.

There were no new relaxations or restrictions as the Centre gave no specific instructions, said an official.

The official said the Centre may issues guidelines on the basis of demands made by several chief ministers during the video-conference held with PM Modi last week.

The Centre had asked for suggestions from states on easing curbs.

The official said restrictions might be relaxed in green and orange zones by restarting public services and industries, but the city was unlikely to be part of it as it fell under the red zone.

Sunday was the last day of the third phase of the lockdown. The national lockdown began on March 25 and was extended on April 15 and again on May 4.
