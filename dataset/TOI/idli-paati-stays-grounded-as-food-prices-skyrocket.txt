2020-04-27
COIMBATORE: While prices of grocery items have gone up amid the lockdown, M Kamalthal, the 85-year-old ‘idli paati’, who sells idlis for Rs 1, has not hiked the price. 


From her house-cum-outlet in Vadivelampalayam near Alandurai here, she continues to sell idlis, mainly to people from other places, who have not option to return home or to cook themselves.

 
Help pours in for 82-year-old Coimbatore woman who sells idli for Re 1After videos and news reports of M Kamalathal, the 82-year-old woman in Coimbatore district who sells idlis for Re 1, became viral, praise and help have been pouring for her from all quarters.


“It is a hard time. Prices of urad dal and roasted gram have gone up from Rs 100 to Rs 150 and that of chilli has gone up from Rs 150 to Rs 200. But I will not hike the price. I still sell idlis for Rs 1. I will manage somehow,” Kamalthal told TOI.



She caters to more than 300 people per day. However, she encourages customers to have her idlis at their place to ensure social distancing.

“There are people who have come from other places. What would they do for food? I have been catering to them,” said the octogenarian, who has been selling idlis for Rs 1 more than three decades.

Well-wishers have also been helping the granny by giving her grocery items and vegetables to help her tide over the situation. “People have been giving vegetables, rice and dal. I’m happy that they help me in this hard time,” she said.

DMK president M K Stalin spoke to her via video conferencing on Saturday evening.

Though Kamalathal has not increased the price of her idlis for more than 30 years, she became widely known last September after reports of her big-heartedness went viral. Several prominent figures had extended support to her.
