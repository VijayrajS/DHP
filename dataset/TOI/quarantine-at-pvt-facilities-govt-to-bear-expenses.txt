Gandhinagar: Following the uproar created by those who flew in from overseas and complained of sub-standard quarantine facilities at government hospitals, the state government on Thursday said that it will bear the costs for quarantine of passengers who prefer to remain under observation at private hospitals or even hotels.State deputy chief minister and health minister Nitin Patel, in the state assembly, said that the state government will bear the costs for international passengers opting for quarantine at private facilities such as hotels or the like. Patel said the government is working out a mechanism through which it can bear these costs.“Considering representations made by persons advised to remain quarantined, the government has decided to keep them at the private hotels before they are allowed to go for home quarantine,” Patel said.
