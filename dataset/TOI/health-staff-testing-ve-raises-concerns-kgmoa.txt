2020-04-30
Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) has expressed concerns over health workers at the primary level, including doctors, becoming Covid-19 positive in the state.

In a representation given to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the KGMOA leaders urged the state government to ensure the safety of the health workers who are working round-the-clock as per the guidelines issued by the state government in the Covid prevention activities. 

“It is a matter of concern that health workers, including doctors, at the primary level are tested positive. All the health workers are in the forefront of the prevention activities using the protective gears and following the safety guidelines issued by the state government. It is not a good sign that the health workers themselves are contracting Covid-19,’’ said KGMOA state president Dr Joseph Chacko.

The association leaders warned that if more health workers are testing positive of Covid-19, then there are every chances of the disease spreading among the public. Hence the KGMOA has urged the CM to ensure the quality of protection gears that are being supplied to the healthcare workers. There is severe shortage of N95 masks in the primary and community health care centres, KGMOA said.

Number of fever cases reaching the hospitals is increasing and there is a need for doctors and other para medical staff everywhere to wear masks for self-protection. Only two-layer masks are supplied at primary-level hospitals, which do not ensure protection. 

KGMOA also told the CM that protective gears’ supply is not done as per demand and at several times the quality of the products had to be compromised. They also warned that a reserve pool of healthcare workers should be created or else the functioning of the entire hospitals will be affected if anyone among them becomes positive for Covid-19.
