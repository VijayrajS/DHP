2020-04-25
HYDERABAD: Nearly 30% of the districts in Telangana have been declared Covid-19 free by the government. The districts include those which did not report a single case, where all positive cases have turned negative and persons have been discharged.


“Nine districts of total 33 have had zero coronavirus cases in the past couple of weeks. In these nine, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, Wanaparthy and Warangal (Rural) have not reported any cases since the outbreak. Siddipet, Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Mulug, Nagarkurnool, Narayanpet and Mahabubabad did report positive cases but now all persons detected with Covid-19 have been discharged,” health minister Eatala Rajender told TOI on Friday.

Official sources said another six districts — Jagtial, Bhupalpally, Peddpalli, Asifabad, Rajanna-Sircilla and Medak — will become Covid-19 free in a week. These districts had reported two to three cases earlier and all those patients will be discharged soon. Karimnagar, which was the second district to report a Covid-19 case after Hyderabad in the state, will become safe by the end of this month. 

“Even after declaring districts with zero cases now, we will continue the surveillance for some time, especially on people who had tested positive and surrounding areas,” the health minister said. 

The government is worried about rising cases in districts like Suryapet and Gadwal besides the GHMC area. Districts like Nizamabad and Vikarabad have 58 and 33 positive cases respectively but there have been no new cases in the two districts.

The government continues to review the coronavirus cases and taking stock of the situation in containment zones and lockdown implementation, officials said. “In Greater Hyderabad, 20 containment zones have been withdrawn and one in Mahbubnagar district. Some containment zones in Nizamabad town will be withdrawn soon,” a senior official said.
