2020-05-25
HYDERABAD: With the lockdown slotted to end soon, the state health department has come up with a strategy to control the spread of Covid-19 post the lockdown. Apart from increased surveillance and precautions, a lot of focus will be given on migrants returning from various other states and the high-risk population, which can have a high mortality in case of Covid-19 infection.

The high-risk categories include people with diabetes, hypertension and tuberculosis patients. The state health department, in a bid to reduce their exposure to Covid-19, is planning to provide doorstep treatment to them. “All such persons, including elderly will be advised to stay indoors. We have placed order for procuring cloth masks, which will be provided (two for each patients) in all districts. Also checking of blood pressure, blood sugar levels etc and drugs for hypertension, diabetes and TB will be provided at the doorstep. We will be providing drugs for a month to each patient undergoing treatment at the government hospitals as these patients are the most vulnerable to Covid-19 infection,” the plan document states.

While keeping an eye on the migrants, special focus will be being given to urban areas which are overcrowded and have unsafe drinking water and sanitation. Involving community leaders to spread awareness and surveillance will be continued. “Also all the Urban Public Health Centres (UPHC) and basti dawakhanas will be monitored daily to keep track of patients with fever and influenza like illnesses,” said a health official.
