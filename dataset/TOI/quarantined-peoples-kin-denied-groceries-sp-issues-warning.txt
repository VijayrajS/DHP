Mysuru: After family members of a quarantined person were denied essential commodities in Bannur town, Mysuru district police have warned those indulging in social boycott of legal action.

After a complaint by the victims, superintendent of police C B Rishyant visited the town on Monday. From a loudspeaker, he told the public: “Some persons have been home quarantined in Bannur town and the district administration is monitoring their health. But we have received complaint that their family members were denied ration, milk and vegetables and were asked to leave the town which is inhuman,” he said.

Rishyanth said that denying essentials commodities to such families and socially boycotting them is against the law. “We will be forced to take stringent action against the persons who are involved in such illegal activity. The family should get ration, milk and vegetables. The district administration has identified the persons who have symptoms and have given proper treatment. There is no need for people to be afraid,” he said.

People residing close to the houses of quarantined people have been living in fear and asking the authorities to shift those isolated at home to hospitals.

Such incidents were reported in Nanjangud where more than 750 are home quarantined. More than 20 tribals left their haadis in HD Kote taluk after 11 employees of Jubilant Life Sciences were quarantined at Ekalavya Boys Hostel near their locality.
