Stress-busting sessions at quarantine centres
2020-05-16
Bhubaneswar: The state government has started holding counselling sessions for migrant workers and stranded people, who are staying in quarantine centres after returning from other states. Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, additional chief secretary and in-charge of health department, said his department staff and counsellors are visiting the quarantine centres and holding counselling sessions for the inmates of the quarantine centres.

 “We are also conducting several stress busting activities including yoga, motivational talks and physical exercises so that the people stay calm and relaxed,” he added. 

A health department officer said migrant workers faced harrowing time while returning to Odisha. “They were under tremendous pressure to come out of their workplace due to lack of jobs and money. The uncertainty and fear of infection had made them desperate to return home. That’s why we need to keep their spirits high with motivational talks and proper counselling,” he added. 

He said the stranded people and migrant workers are getting irritated over small things because of stress. After counselling, they feel relaxed and follow rules of the temporary medical centre (TMC). “People are actively participating in morning exercises and yoga classes without any complain,” he added.

Like these people, many more migrant workers and stranded Odia people are returning home in buses and Shramik Special trains. So far 49 trains carrying around 58,000 people reached Odisha between May 3 and May 15.
