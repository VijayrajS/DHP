India’s lockdown restrictions hit global e-commerce sales, says Walmart
2020-05-20
Bengaluru: Walmart’s international e-commerce sales were hit due to the lockdown curbs that its business in India — Flipkart — faced, even as it saw sales surge in other markets like China, Canada, the UK and Mexico. However, despite the overall drop in business, Walmart said the international unit’s gross profit rate increased by 10 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), primarily due to Flipkart as well. “Limited operations of the company’s Flipkart business in India for a portion of the quarter negatively affected growth,” said Walmart in its earnings presentation on Tuesday for the first quarter (February to April) of 2021.

The government had restricted sales by online retail companies to just essential goods — which included groceries and healthcare products — which accounted for a fraction of Flipkart’s total sales before the lockdown. The shutdown started on March 25 and sales restrictions have been lifted earlier this week. While Flipkart has started grocery delivery across the country, and even tied up with Uber, the overall sales of the online retail industry are expected to take a hit in 2020.

The development comes even as Amazon said last month that it saw the “biggest impact” of the virus outbreak in India among its international markets owing to the lockdown even as its global sales led by the US hit a record high.
