Plan for flu clinics at private hospitals to screen Covid suspects a non-starter for lack of protective gear
2020-03-27
Haridwar: It seems the state government’s plan to open flu clinics at private hospitals in Haridwar and other districts, for free treatment of flu patients, won’t take off. It was expected that besides treating flu patients, the clinics would screen suspected Covid cases and refer them to government hospitals, taking off part of the latter’s burden. 

However, doctors at private hospitals said the lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) and infra-red thermometers or thermal scanners are major reasons why the plan is a non-starter. 

Speaking to TOI, a member of Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Haridwar said, “Even N95 masks and sanitisers are not available to us at a reasonable price.” 

 When asked if any flu clinics are working in Haridwar, chief medical officer Saroj Naithani said, “I have no information on it.” However, she confirmed that a letter to set up these clinics was sent to all 361 registered hospitals/clinics in a WhatsApp group of IMA, Haridwar.

 Regarding the argument that private hospitals were unwilling to set up flu clinics in their premises due to lack of availability of PPEs and thermal scanners, Dr Naithani said, “Doctors are expected to question patients about their travel history and symptoms. If they think there is something amiss, they can bring it to the notice of a government hospital. For this, they don’t require PPE or thermal scanners.” 

 Meanwhile, reacting to the issue, IMA president Dinesh Singh said, “A number of physicians and paediatricians are providing consultation to patients, including those suffering from flu, in emergencies, as OPDs are closed at all hospitals/clinics due to the lockdown. 

He added that “none of the physicians who are looking at patients has so far come across any case of suspected Covid-19.”
