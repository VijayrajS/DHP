HYDERABAD: Despite the Covid-19 cases being on the rise in the country and abroad, it has not affected passport applicants.


The Regional Passport Office, Telangana could not find any decline in applying of passports for fresh/normal or tatkal categories.

“ The coronavirus has not shown any impact on passport applicants,” a senior RPO official commented.

A TOI correspondent visited one of the Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) in the city and found passport applicants making a beeline in front of the PSK to get tokens. 

An applicant said, “A passport is an important key document.I would be able to travel abroad within 10 years (as per the passport validity) and the coronavirus outbreak will be controlled by that time.”
