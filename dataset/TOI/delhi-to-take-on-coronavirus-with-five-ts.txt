Delhi to take on coronavirus with five Ts
2020-04-08
NEW DELHI: With chief minister Arvind Kejriwal unveiling a five-point programme, which he referred to as 5Ts — testing, tracing, treatment, team work and tracking and monitoring — to fight novel coronavirus, the focus, among other things, will be on mass testing.


“Maximum testing enables us to know the actual scale of corona infection,” Kejriwal said. “Like South Korea, we will be testing on a larger scale. We were deficient in testing kits until now, but now have the testing capacity. We have ordered rapid testing rounds for one lakh people to begin from Friday. Through rapid testing, we can identify Covid-19 hotspots and take necessary action.”



Delhi government has already sought the help of police to determine whether the people advised self-quarantine had actually undertaken it. “We have given 27,702 contact numbers to police to keep track of their movement. In this manner, we will also be able to monitor the movements of people shifted from the Markaz masjid in Nizamuddin. We will be able to quarantine, seal houses and monitor people this way,” said Kejriwal.

According to the contingency plan in case the number of Covid-19 positive cases crosses 30,000, hospital beds will be increased and hotels, banquet halls and dharamshalas roped in. “If we have such a number of active patients in the city, we will have 8,000 hospital beds, 12,000 beds in hotels and 10,000 in banquet halls and dharamshalas,” disclosed Kejriwal. “Serious patients suffering from heart diseases and other conditions and patients above 50 years will be kept in isolation in hospitals, while the rest with minor symptoms will be kept in isolation in hotels and dharamshalas. We will need 400 ventilators and 1,200 oxygen kits for 30,000 patients. The shortage of personal protection equipment kits that we were facing will now be resolved after the Union government has provided us 27,000 PPE kits.”

At present, the government has earmarked 2,950 beds in hospitals, including 450 in three private hospitals, to treat Covid-19 patients. Lok Nayak and GB Pant hospitals are the designated primary hospitals for coronavirus treatment and have, respectively, 1,500 and 500 beds. No other medical treatments are being carried out in these two hospitals. Rajiv Gandhi Hospital with 450 beds is also a corona hospital. Kejriwal announced that the if number of cases crossed 3,000, then Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital would also be declared a corona hospital. Its 1,500 beds would make a total of 4,500 beds available for Covid-19 patients, the CM said.
