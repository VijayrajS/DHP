HYDERABAD: Chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Monday directed the districts collectors to monitor the prices of essential commodities, set up at least two quarantine centres with required facilities in every district and enforce strictly the lockdown rules to prevent spread of coronavirus.


The chief secretary held a video conference with district collectors on the control of Covid–19 and said a control room with two senior IAS officers — Rahul Bojja and Anil Kumar — has been set up at the secretariat to monitor and guide collectors on prevention of spread of coronavirus. The CS said similar control rooms should be set up in the districts too.

The collectors should also ensure that the inter-disciplinary teams visited the list of families who have returned from foreign travel and also on those who are home quarantined. He said community watch has to be encouraged as part of containment plan.

Daily reports should be furnished to the control room. An app has been developed to monitor the quarantine activities in the districts. The CS directed the collectors to constitute area-based teams to take up surveillance of home quarantined. 

“Implement the government orders and ensure that not more than one person shall be allowed to move on a two-wheeler and not more than two persons shall be allowed on a four-wheeler. No movement of any persons shall be permitted for any purpose other than accessing emergency medical care from 7pm to 6am daily,” Somesh Kumar said.

The collectors should also ensure availability of essential commodities like milk, vegetables, groceries and medicines. “Allow movement of essential commodities at checkposts,” the CS told the collectors and asked them to increase the number of paddy procurement centres.
