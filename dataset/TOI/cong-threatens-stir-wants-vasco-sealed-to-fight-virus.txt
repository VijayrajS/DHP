2020-06-09
Panaji: Issuing an ultimatum to the state government, Congress on Sunday threatened to hold a ‘rasta roko’ protest if the BJP-led state government did not impose a complete lockdown in Vasco to rein in the Covid-19 cases.

In a letter to the chief secretary Parimal Rai and health secretary Nila Mohanan, the party said it would hold protests right from Canacona to Pernem. 

The party has not specified a date for the protests, with a senior party functionary saying that it would not be done in the coming days.

“Goa Pradesh Congress Committee demands complete lockdown in Vasco town where more than 200 cases of Covid-19 have been reported till date, and if the government continues to ignore the situation then the cases will increase and the situation may be worse,” said the party’s youth president Varad Mardolkar.

The party has suggested that all the borders should be sealed and only essential commodities should be allowed in. 

“The borders must be equipped with all the facilities like thermal gun, OPD centres and all other medical amenities. All the vehicles carrying essential commodities, the drivers of those vehicles should strictly be checked and permitted to carry and distribute commodities,” said party spokesperson Agnel Fernandes.

Similarly, airports and railway stations should be equipped with medical facilities and ambulances. The government also needs to order 500 ventilators, said Congress.

The party has also demanded that trucks carrying iron ore, manganese and other mineral resources should be stopped till the situation improves.
