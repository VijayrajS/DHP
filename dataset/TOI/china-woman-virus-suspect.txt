UDAIPUR: Another suspected coronavirus tourist in Udaipur had the health department on alert mode as it rushed to screen the hotel staff where the woman had stayed for a day. 

According to sources, a Chinese woman had come to Udaipur with three friends from Delhi on January 31. They stayed in a hotel in Lalghat area here for a day. They flew back to Delhi the next day. However, the woman complained of high fever at the Medanta Hospital counter at Delhi airport and was admitted in a hospital there. Her blood samples have been sent for investigation. 

The medical department was alerted here and asked to screen people at the hotel where the Chinese tourist stayed. CMHO Dinesh Kharadi and his team screened the staff on Sunday. According to sources, blood samples of some of the staff have been collected who had come in close contact with the suspect. 

Earlier, two passengers who came to Udaipur after having travelled with a medical student who tested positive for the virus in Kerala, had been kept in isolation ward here at the MB Hospital. One of them was a Chinese woman while another was from Bharatpur. Both left the hospital and went to Jaipur without seeking discharge which has been taken as a serious security flaw at a time when the virus outbreak is causing global panic.
