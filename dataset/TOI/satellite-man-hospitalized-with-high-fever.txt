“The patient came with symptoms akin to viral infection with high-grade fever. Since he has recently travelled to Germany – one of the affected countries – we have kept him in the isolation ward. His blood sample has been sent for testing and the report should be available by Friday,” said Dr GH Rathod, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital Asarwa.

 
 
Rathod confirmed that the man is in a stable condition. “So far, some 14 patients with suspected COVID-19 were admitted at the hospital. However, all of their reports are negative,” Rathod further added.

State health authorities are aggressively conducting surveillance and monitoring, to prevent occurrence and spread of COVID-19 cases. While a team of medical practitioners has been deployed at Ahmedabad and Surat international airports, even hotels across the state have been asked to make mandatory arrangements for screening all travellers and staffers and keep the state health department informed if anyone is reported with body temperature of 99°F or above.
