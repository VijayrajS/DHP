‘Govt should foot bill for quarantine’
2020-05-10
Panaji: The Goan Seamen Association of India has expressed disappointment with the latest government order forcing those returning to their home state as well as seafarers to pay for quarantine facilities. 

Co-founder of the association Dixon Vaz said the Goa government must provide seafarers and those returning from abroad after having lost jobs with an option of paid or free government quarantine facilities. 

“Those returning from the Gulf have lost their jobs and the government expects them to pay for quarantine facilities? Shipping companies are not willingly paying for quarantine facilities. It is only the Goa government who is forcing the companies to pay for mandatory quarantine services,” he said.
