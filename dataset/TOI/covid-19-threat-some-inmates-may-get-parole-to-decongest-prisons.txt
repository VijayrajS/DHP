Covid-19 threat: Some inmates may get parole to decongest prisons
2020-03-29
Dehradun: After a Supreme Court directive, Uttarakhand’s administration is considering if it could decrease the number of inmates in various prisons of the state in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. A committee has also been set up in this regard which will look into the possibilities of sending the prisoners on parole for the time being. According to the prison administration, the list of prisoners who can be given parole will be completed within the next few days.

“According to the direction of the honourable Supreme Court, we are considering if we can decrease the number of inmates in prisons. It is under active consideration and prisoners who have only a few years left of their imprisonment period are being considered for parole. A committee has been formed and it will consider various feasible options. The committee will submit the list of prisoners who will be sent out on parole within the next couple of days,” said PVK Prasad, ADG (prisons) Uttarakhand. 

A member of the prison administration told TOI, “The release orders of convicts will be sent out by the prison administration while the interim bail orders of those, whose cases are still in courts, will be released at the magistrate level. In most of the prisons, the population of inmates is more than the designated capacity at present and giving parole to some will be a relief for us, especially during such dire times.”
