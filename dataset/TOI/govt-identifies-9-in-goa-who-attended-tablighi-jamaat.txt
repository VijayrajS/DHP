PANAJI: The state government said on Wednesday that nine persons in Goa who were in Delhi to attend the Tablighi Jamaat’s markaz last month have been quarantined. A senior health department official told TOI that even if they didn’t attend the main function, they came in contact with Covid-19 positive persons while there. “They have been quarantined at Mayem residency,” he said.


Meanwhile, the state government said that the family members of the nine have been home-quarantined. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that they arrived in Goa from Gujarat and Kerala prior to March 15. The CM also said that he has directed the inspector general of police (IGP) to check with each police station to find out how many people have returned to Goa after attending it.

“We have no information about anybody coming after March 15,” Sawant said. The markaz in Nizamuddin, which was attended by over 3,400 people in mid-March, is thought to be a hotspot for coronavirus, as many who attended it have since tested positive for Covid-19.

Sawant thus asked the IGP to seek a report from every PI and submit it to the CMO. “I have already spoken to the IGP and some police inspectors,” said Sawant. “The Tablighi Jamaat has become dangerous for the country. It won’t be wrong to say that the community has put the country in trouble.”

Sawant said all nine of those identified were inside the mosque. “We have to be alert about these people,” he said. “They have done what they should not have done. I think they should be punished.”

The thousands who attended the religious meeting in mid-March then returned to different parts of the country. The directorate of health services said that several of them tested positive for Covid-19.
