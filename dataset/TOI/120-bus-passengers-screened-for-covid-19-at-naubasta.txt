Kanpur: Nearly 120 passengers, travelling in a sleeper Volvo bus on way to Lucknow from Ghaziabad, were screened for symptoms of coronavirus at the Naubasta by-pass here on Saturday.

The district administration has decided to conduct the screening of passengers. The step has been taken to keep a check on the spread of Covid-19 in the state. ACM (first) RP Verma said, “We are focusing on the long distance private tourist buses entering the city from different national highways criss-crossing district borders. Nearly 120 passengers were examined on Saturday at Naubasta bypass, the entry point which bus operators usually prefer via NH 25. The bus with passengers of Lucknow and Sitapur had left Ghaziabad on March 27. A team of doctors, including Dr Alok Nigam, Dr Raj Bahadur and Dr Ajit, conducted screening of all the bus passengers. Our focus is on gathering information about passengers.”

He said they gathered information about the passengers having history of foreign travel and those who have come in contact with persons who have some travel history.

“Bus owner Shahnawaz, a native of Hapur, stated that he had valid permission from Ghaziabad authorities for operating vehicle to Lucknow and then to Sitapur. We are scanning permit and other papers of the bus to verify bus owner's claim. After screening and medical test, the passengers would be allow to travel further," he said and added, "Doctors are examining whether they have any symptoms of cough, cold and flu."

Meanwhile, passengers alleged that the bus staff had charged Rs 1200 for travelling inside the bus, while for travelling on roof-top, they had to pay Rs 500 to 600.
