Biz as usual despite full lockdown

Trichy: As per the colour-code system implemented by Trichy Corporation for the curfew, Saturdays and Sundays are supposed to be complete lockdown days. But on Saturday, a majority of the grocery shops in the city were doing brisk business with people crowding at the outlets.

The colour-code system implemented by the corporation last week permitted the residents to go out for purchasing essential commodities and vegetables only for one day in a week. Five colour passes given to residents entitled them to venture out only between Mondays and Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays should be considered as complete shutdown days, except for medical establishments and pharmacies, and milk stalls.

Residents without colour passes were seen on the roads in Big Bazaar Street, and serpentine queues were seen outside the grocery stores. “The crowd on Saturday shows the failure of the pass system. Many residents did not receive the pass on time, so they came out for shopping,” K Sivakumar, a resident of Eda Street, said. While implementing the curfew pass system, the corporation officials said that the city police would be shared the ward-wise colour codes and the days allotted for them to step out. But no such enforcement was seen on Saturday.

“The crowds at shops have reduced only by afternoon on Saturday. It appears that pass system was ineffective,” a police officer in the city added.
