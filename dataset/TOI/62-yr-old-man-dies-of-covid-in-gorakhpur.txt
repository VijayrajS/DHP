GORAKHPUR: A 62-year-old Covid positive man from Mohri Purva tola in Campierganj Tehsil of Gorakhpur died on Saturday morning. 


The deceased had returned from Mumbai on Sunday. He had been suffering from multiple diseases, and after his health checkup at Bankati health centre, doctors referred him to Maharajganj district hospital from where he was further referred to BRD Medical College. He was admitted to BRD Medical College on Friday night and died on Saturday morning, confirmed college principal Dr Ganesh Kumar.

However, it is yet to be ascertained as to which district this case will be counted in—Gorakhpur or Maharajganj. The chief medical officers of the two districts haven’t reached a consensus. Gorakhpur CMO Dr Srikant Tiwari said although Campierganj tehsil is in Gorakhpur, the health services were offered at Maharajganj and his swab sample also arrived from Maharajganj district hospital, and hence it is a case of Maharajganj. Whereas, Maharajganj CMO AK Srivastav said since the deceased was a resident of Gorakhpur, it must add to the Gorakhpur Covid data.
