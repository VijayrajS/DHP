HYDERABAD: Outpatient numbers fell at Gandhi Hospital where coronavirus suspects are being isolated. While the hospital usually sees about 5,000 outpatients each day, for the past couple of days the number has come down to about 1,200. 


"As samples of two new patients, who were tested positive in the city, were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for confirmation, the number outpatients on Wednesday was just about 1,200," said a source from Gandhi Hospital.

On Wednesday, many people suspecting that they have the virus, visited Gandhi Hospital and gave their samples for tests. However, when TOI visited the hospital, it saw that there was a shortage of N-95 masks (useful to prevent spread of highly infectious diseases like Corona). Also, there were no clear instructions for the patients with symptoms about directions to the isolation ward, where their samples were being tested. 

"I have directed nearly four foreign nationals and a few locals to the emergency block where they do the testing. Many patients with symptoms are going directly to the outpatient ward to get their samples tested as they do not know where to go," said a security guard at the hospital, on condition of anonymity.
