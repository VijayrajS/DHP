GANDHINAGAR: Hareet Shukla, the 1999-batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer who is secretary, science and technology department and also the in-charge CEO of Dholera SIR, has tested positive for Covid-19 and is in home isolation as he has mild symptoms only. Shukla has almost recovered and is expected to join work after completing the mandatory isolation period.

Shukla who is also secretary of the Gujarat IAS association, was given the key work of ensuring procurement for Covid treatment at all the government hospitals.

Shukla, 44, is the first secretary-rank IAS officer in the state to test positive. Few staffers of the GSBTM (Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission), who were working under Shukla and a few employees of the department have also tested positive. Shukla was interacting with health department officials, however it has not been established how he got infected.

He said, “I don’t have any symptoms now, after I tested positive a few days ago. I felt some symptoms so I got myself tested and the result was positive. On doctors’ advise, I was home quarantined and I am fine now. I will return to work in about a week after getting a negative test result.” He advised people not to panic and follow protocols laid down by the government and doctors. “Together we will fight against the pandemic and win,” he said.
