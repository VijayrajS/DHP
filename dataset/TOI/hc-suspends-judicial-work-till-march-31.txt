2020-03-19
AHMEDABAD: As a precaution against the novel coronavirus, the Gujarat high court on Wednesday announced that it was deferring all judicial work till March 31, except urgent matters which lawyers convince the court to take up. Even those lodged behind the bars can wait in jail till the end of the month.


The chief justice suspended preparation of the cause list, the list of cases to be heard by courts in the course of the day. “From March 19, 2020 till March 31, 2020, no cause list shall be prepared and notified including for bail matters and quashing matters. Any advocate desirous of obtaining an urgent order shall file a note stating the urgency and the same shall be considered by the court. If the court finds that there is genuine urgency, the matter shall be either listed on the same day if no caveat is there or on the next day,” the HC’s notice reads.

The chief justice instructed that all the cases be listed in staggered manner and in cases in which interim relief is to end before March 31, the court’s protection will stand extended merely on informing the concerned court official. 

The HC, first by a judicial order and then by issuing administrative instructions in last five days, has curtailed judicial work on a large scale in a bid to avoid gatherings either at the courtroom or on court campuses.
