Visakhapatnam: Fishermen in Andhra Pradesh breathed a sigh of relief after the Union government issued a notification exempting all fishing activities from the lockdown. Fishermen in the state will now be able to venture into the sea and sell their catch till April 14 before the fishing ban begins on April 15.

Arjili Dasu, a fisherman and activist said, “There has hardly been any fishing activity in the state since the lockdown was imposed. The state government had issued a ban on fishing and the fisheries department had imposed a ban on auctions. Now, the fishermen will be able to earn at least for a few days.”

The department of home affairs, in its April 10 order, stated that fishing operations (marine) or aquaculture industry including fishing, maintenance, harvesting, processing, packaging, cold chain, sale and marketing would be exempt from lockdown restrictions.

However, the order mentioned that social distancing and hygiene practices must be ensured during business.

On March 31, TOI reported that if fishing were to remain stalled for over 80 days, there would be a severe scarcity of fish from the end of April and the situation would improve only after the fishing ban was lifted on June 14.

The Union government has asked the state ministry of fisheries to provide details of fishermen, fish workers and vendors affected by the lockdown. There are around 1 lakh 10 thousand registered fishermen in the state.
