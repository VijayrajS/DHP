Kozhikode: Popular Front of India (PFI) workers have taken the initiative in burying the body of a person who died while staying in home quarantine at Beypore. The man or anyone in his family were not tested positive for Covid 19. But a member in the family had come into contact with another person who is now under observation in the medical college hospital.

The family had been asked to go on quarantine as a precaution though the person in the hospital is not tested positive. Meanwhile, one of the family members died on Tuesday and the body was buried following the Covid-19 protocol. “There is no need to get scared in such circumstances, but we must exercise all precautions,” Sajeer Mathottaam, secretary of PFI Kozhikode south committee, wrote on Facebook. “PFI workers undertook the task of burying the body as per the wish of the deceased’s family. PFI workers V Musthafa, M Shanavas, Sufi Marad, Hakkil Marad and Jamsheer Marad were part of the team,” he said. PFI workers were also involved in the burial of some of those died during the Nipah outbreak.
