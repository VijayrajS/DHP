Flu or Covid-19? Dial 108 to get tested in Visakhapatnam
2020-03-27
VISAKHAPATNAM: Health experts are advising locals with symptoms of Covid-19 to immediately isolate themselves and dial the emergency number 108 instead of panicking.


Doctors have said that fever or the presence of Covid-19 symptoms does not mean that one has contracted the disease. If a person has no travel history in the last one month and has not been in direct contact with any suspected case of Covid-19 but still develops fever, cough and cold and fatigue, it is likely that the patient is suffering from a viral fever or the flu but chances of Covid-19 acquired through secondary sources cannot be ruled out, said doctors.

In such cases, the person should self-isolate, not come in contact with family and dial 108, stating his location and health condition, advised district medical and health officer (DMHO) in-charge Dr K Vijayalakshmi.

“Once 108 service is called, our Rapid Action Team consisting of a medical officer will visit the house and bring the case to King George Hospital (KGH) or Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH/Government Chest Hospital) and admit the patient. After testing, if the person is found to be Covid-19 negative and only suffering from usual viral fever, paracetamol tablets and required medicines will be prescribed and the patient will be sent home,” Dr Vijayalakshmi added.

The DMHO in-charge further said, “If it is found that the person is suffering from dengue, flu or other ailments, the patient has a choice to get admitted either in the government hospitals like KGH or go to a private hospital. However, if the test reports are Covid-19 positive, the patient will continue the treatment at IDH.”
