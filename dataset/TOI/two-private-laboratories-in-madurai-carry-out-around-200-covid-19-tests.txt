Madurai: At the two private hospital labs approved for Covid-19 testing in Madurai, as many as around 200 Covid-19 tests have been carried out since the labs started functioning. As per protocol, the labs are testing only suspected cases with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI).

“Week after we received approval, we procured necessary testing kits and started functioning from May 8 onwards. Out of the 150 people tested here so far, a cardiac patient has tested positive,” said J Adel, GM (operations), Meenakshi Mission. The 150 people tested include outpatients and inpatients at the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. The manager said that as per protocol, only after detailed examination by doctors, those with symptoms are asked to take the test. 

At the other private Covid-19 testing lab in Madurai at Apollo Hospitals, officials said that around 40-50 samples have been tested since it started functioning a week ago. “We were strictly asked to test only those with symptoms of Covid-19. Though many Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic, it is not possible to test so many people every day. There is no need to test if someone is simply having a sore throat. We are getting around 5-10 tests done per day now,” said a senior official at the hospital. 

The current procedure for Covid-19 testing at private labs involve uploading details of any patient undergoing testing via an app which is monitored by government health officials including the state health secretary and ICMR. The official added that a detailed report from the time of admission to lab test results are updated as and when done to ensure there is no room for ambiguity.

The hospitals are charging Rs 4,500 for a test, which is expected to be revised soon.
