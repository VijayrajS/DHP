Nashik: After a physician of the Nashik civil hospital tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, senior doctors have instructed all the medical staff in the hospital to take maximum precautions and not leave any chance which could lead to infection. 

Senior medical officers of the civil hospital said that all doctors and medical staff have been provided with PPE kits, N95 masks and top quality gloves along with other safety equipment to ensure that they do not get infected with the virus. 

The doctors and other medical staff were yet again sensitized about the precautionary measures they must take while dealing with Covid-19 cases as well as protect themselves from contracting the infection. 

Sanjay Gangurde of the Nashik civil hospital said that the hospital premises is being sprayed with the necessary medicine to leave no chance of infection.

“There is a separate team of doctors, nurses and medical staff for treating Covid-19 patients. The concerned doctor who got infected with the virus was only into screening the newly-arrived patients,” he said.

The physician had worn the complete safety kit while taking the details of the newly-arrived Covid-19 suspects. The suspected patient stood at a distance of three feet from the concerned physician when he gave his details to the latter.

If the physician thinks that the throat swab of the suspect should be taken, the procedure of the same is carried out by another team of doctors and nurses. 

Medicos at the civil hospital said that though they were taking all the necessary precautions while handling Covid-19 suspects and patients, one is never able to gauge which corner of the huge 540-bed hospital would be unsafe. 

Since patients from across Nashik and other districts come to the civil hospital for treatment, the risk of contracting the infection is high, said senior doctors.
