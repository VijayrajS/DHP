A communication to this effect was sent by the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, and was then circulated to all state departments.

Goa had no Covid-19 cases until Wednesday evening. All suspects who were quarantined in the GMC last week were discharged after their test reports came negative for the virus. 

Meanwhile, health minister Vishwajit Rane said he has told chief secretary Parimal Rai to instruct government departments to procure face masks and hand sanitizers as a precautionary measure. “The health secretary has also been asked to speak to secretaries of the various departments to procure masks and sterillium for their staff,” he said. 

Similar directions were also issued to hospitals, he said. “Security guards at entry points have been told to request visitors to sanitize their hands before entering hospital premises. Nurses and other medical staff should wear masks,” Rane said.

Stating that Covid-19 cases around the world have been “growing exponentially”, the health minister said proactive steps had to be taken to thwart its spread. He reiterated that people avoid large gatherings. “People should wear masks while travelling or while in a crowd,” he said.
