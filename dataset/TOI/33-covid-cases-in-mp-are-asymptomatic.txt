2020-05-31
Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh with an approximate positivity rate of 6.1% of those tested for Covid-19, could have nearly one-third cases which are asymptomatic, according to Indian Journal of Medical Research. There are red, orange and green zones in MP for Covid-19-19. These patients were asymptomatic but tested positive .

MP now has a total of 7891 positive cases spread across 51 districts. The death toll is 343 of which about 235 deaths have happened in Indore, Ujjain and Bhopal. 

The average daily rate of positive cases has increased from 35 in Lockdown 1.0 to 222 in Lockdown 4.0. “This is due to more testing which is good. But this shows that at the end of the lockdown of 66 days, the trend is going up at a much higher pace,” said Jan Swasth Abhiyan, representative, Amulya Nidhi.

When contacted, MP health department official said, “Asymptomatic data of Covid-19 is not prepared separately.”

Going by health bulletins, more samples are being received, but the number of daily tests are lesser than the daily samples received. Madhya Pradesh still has only 20 testing labs whereas Maharashtra has 78 testing labs, Tamil Nadu has 71 and Gujarat has 39 test labs, he said. 

“It is crucial to increase testing capacity of MP, otherwise the situation will go out of hand in the coming days,” he added. 

Going into lockdown 5.0, there are 25 Category 1 Covid hospitals in the state. As the average rate of positive cases has now gone up from 35 in Lockdown 1.0 to 222 in Lockdown 4.0, it is essential to assess the future need for Covid hospitals, ventilators and oxygen cylinders which are crucial for critical patients. “It is important to maintain transparency and in public interest, number of ventilators, oxygen cylinders and ICU beds must be increased,” he said.
