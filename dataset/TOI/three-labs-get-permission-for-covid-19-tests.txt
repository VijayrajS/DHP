Vadodara: With three private facilities getting nod for Covid-19 testing, the city will have the capacity to perform 140 more tests. But there is still no clarity if these testing facilities would help increase the tests being conducted by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and Vadodara district panchayat health officials.

Sources said two private laboratories – Toprani Advanced Lab Systems (TALS) and Divine Lab – as well as Bhailal Amin General Hospital (BAGH) have been granted permission for conducting the tests. The laboratories have got clearance from National Accreditation Board for Laboratories, Indian Council for Medical Research and state government.

VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said TALS had a capacity of doing 50 tests, Divine Lab for 75 tests and BAGH for 20 tests. He, however, said the testing facilities could be used by VMC only if tests were performed for free.

The facilities would, however, increase the overall number of tests performed in the city even if VMC or district health officials don’t use them. 

Parul Sevashram Hospital, Dhiraj General Hospital and GMERS, Gotri Hospital have also applied for performing Covid-19 tests. 

GMERS, Gotri Hospital being a government hospital can conduct tests of samples collected by VMC and district health officials. This will increase the testing in the city significantly. SSG Hospital – the only testing facility in the city – can conduct around 250 tests. It is burdened with samples from other districts too.
