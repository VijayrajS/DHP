PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will set up isolation wards at 12 private hospitals in a week as a precautionary measure against novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Civic officials said the isolation wards will be set up on the lines of the PMC-run Naidu hospital. “A total of 36 travellers were screened for the novel coronavirus infection and all tested negative. However, we have decided to scale up the monitoring, for which private hospitals have been roped in for setting up isolation wards,” Sanjeev Wavare, head of the insect control department, PMC, said.

He said the new isolation wards in private hospitals will be ready in a week. “These hospitals have given in-principal approval to start the facility. Such additional measures were also taken during the spread of H1N1 virus in the city a few years ago and showed good results,” Wavare said.

The civic body also plans to join hands with doctors’ associations to create awareness about the contagion, for which training programmes will be held for medical practitioners.

According to Wavare, 35 ventilators, 40 isolation wards and 25 ICUs will be available once the isolation wards in private hospitals are ready. 

“There is no need to panic. The training will emphasis educating the doctors, who will further guide the patients in their hospitals,” Rajendra Jagtap of the Society of Emergency Medical Services said.

 Travellers from Nepal, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia will now also be screened to avoid spread of novel coronavirus. The screening is already being held for travellers arriving from China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore.
