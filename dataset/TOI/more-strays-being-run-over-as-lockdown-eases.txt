More strays being run over as lockdown eases in Chennai

CHENNAI: Ever since lockdown eased, Dr M Alagesan, a veterinarian at Blue Cross of India (BCI), has had his hands full attending to dogs hit by speeding vehicles. “Many of them have pelvic, head and crush injuries,” he says.

With very few people and vehicles on the roads during lockdown, stray animals, especially dogs, have got used to sleeping on the roads. And now, with restrictions relaxed and more people back on the streets, accidents cases involving animals are being reported across the city. Animal welfare activists are requesting people to drive slowly and keep an eye out for strays.

“In April, we had 155 rescues, of which 37 were accident cases. In May, we had 156 rescues, 50 being accidents, and by June 8, we have had 51 cases, of which 14 were accident cases,” says Dr Alagesan.

The reason is simple. “Many motorists, especially those riding two-wheelers, are speeding as roads are less busy. Dogs, who have got used to lying on the roads, are getting hit,” says Chinny Krishna, co-founder, BCI, adding that people who have not taken out their vehicles for months also need to check under them before moving them. “Many dogs seek shelter under vehicles, so give them a chance to get out.”

Animal welfare activist Shravan Krishnan, who runs Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary, says they are prepared to handle the increasing cases. “More accidents will happen and also get reported as people are out there now. We have four vets working round the clock,” he says. “People should drive slowly and carefully, especially at night, and also make sure their headlights and horn are working properly. It can save an animal’s life.”
