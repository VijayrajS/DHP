BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Four persons from two families in Jabalpur have tested positive for Coronavirus, putting Madhya Pradesh on the Covid-19 map, nearly 50 days after the first case was reported in India.


Jabalpur collector Bharat Yadav said, “Four patients, all of whom had returned from abroad, have tested positive for Coronavirus. They are in isolation in hospital. We are tracing the people they would have come in contact with and keeping them in isolation as well. Appropriate measures are being taken to contain the virus.”

 
 

One of them, a male student, has returned from Germany and the others are back from vacation in Dubai. “They are from two families. The two localities where they live have been locked down completely. Each and every resident is being scanned,” the collector added. All four are under 45 years of age. Two of them are women. “They came on different flights. The passengers who were sitting within 1m radius of these affected patients on both flights are being traced. All of them will be screened for Coronavirus,” said Jabalpur chief medical and health officer Dr Manish Mishra. He appealed to residents to “remain alert and take all precautionary measures”.
