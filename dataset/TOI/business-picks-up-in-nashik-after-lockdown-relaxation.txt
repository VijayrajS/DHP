2020-06-07
Nashik: With the state government announcing relaxations in lockdown rules and allowing reopening of establishments, people in the city have started thronging the markets again. 

Shops and markets in the city have restarted operation after a gap of nearly 74 days. However, social distancing has gone for a toss at some places and there have been reports that people are not cooperating with shopkeepers. 

“We step out of our houses only to buys essentials such as clothes, school books etc. We hope to wind up our purchases soon and we are being cautious. ‘Not to touch anything’ is the mantra we carry along,” Nilesh Kulkarni, a city resident, said.

Though some shopkeepers are ensuring that social distance is maintained and people wear masks, at some places, especially shops in small lanes, these rules are still being ignored.

Autorickshaws back 

on city roads

Autorickshaws have also started plying on the city roads. However, they carry only two people at a time. “Since we are allowed to ply passengers for essential services only, we are mostly ferrying elderly people, especially those who travel to hospitals, pension offices or banks. We avoid taking long distance passengers,” Santosh Kale, an autorickshaw driver, said.
