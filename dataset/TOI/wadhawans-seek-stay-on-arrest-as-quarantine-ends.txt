Wadhawans seek stay on arrest as quarantine ends
2020-04-23
Mumbai/Pune: State home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Wednesday that the government has written to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to take custody of the Wadhawan brothers as their 14-day quarantine period ended on Wednesday afternoon. 

Earlier on Saturday, though, the special lockdown court had stayed non-bailable warrants issued against Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan, promoters of DHFL, till May 5 in the Yes Bank case registered by the CBI. This has granted them relief from arrest in the case till May 5. Besides, on Wednesday, the Wadhawans moved anticipatory bail pleas before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court. 

The court directed the ED to not take coercive steps against them and to file their reply on Thursday. This, too, is in connection with the ED’s case against them in the Yes Bank matter.

Meanwhile, Satara police communicated to both CBI and ED that they will hand over their custody on Thursday. Satara superintendent of police Tejaswini Satpute told TOI: “We have communicated this to CBI and ED as both brothers are wanted in multiple cases.” Twenty-three members of the Wadhawan family had violated the lockdown and travelled to Mahabaleshwar., which falls under Satara police jurisdiction. “We sent letters to CBI and ED on Tuesday, which I will share on social media. Until any of the agencies take their charge, Wadhawans will remain in the state government custody.” said Deshmukh.
