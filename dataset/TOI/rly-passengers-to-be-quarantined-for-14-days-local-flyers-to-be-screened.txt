Mumbai: Railway passengers to be quarantined for 14 days, local flyers to be screened
2020-05-23
MUMBAI: Soon, railway passengers arriving in the city from other states will be home quarantined for 14 days even if they do not show any Covid-19 symptoms. If found to have symptoms, the passengers will be sent on institutional quarantine.

Domestic flyers will undergo routine thermal screening on arrival and will be quarantined if they show any symptoms. If a flyer is expected to stay on in Mumbai for a few days, he or she will have to submit an address proof. 

These are part of the new protocol for rail and air travel the BMC is expected to announce in a day or two, considering that domestic flights will resume operations from May 25 and trains from June 1. 

All passengers arriving by trains will undergo thermal screening at stations. “If a passenger is arriving from another state, he or she will be quarantined for 14 days, whether they have any symptoms or otherwise,” a senior bureucrat told TOI on Friday. 

Meanwhile, the BMC has also tweaked the rules for international air travellers flying into the city through Vande Bharat Mission flights. They will be put under institutional quarantine in hotels for 14 days and thereafter in home quarantine for a similar duration. The flyers will undergo tests seven to 12 days after their arrival and if found negative, they will be allowed to leave with a 14-day home quarantine stamp on their wrists. Those who are asymptomatic but test positive will be discharged from institutional quarantine only after they test negative.

BMC’s executive heath officer Padmaja Kesarkar said, “The decision has been taken in accordance with central government guidelines.” 

Around 2,350 international flyers who arrived in Mumbai were sent for quarantine.
