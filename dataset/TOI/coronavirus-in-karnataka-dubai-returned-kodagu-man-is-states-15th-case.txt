After he arrived at Kempegowda International Airport on March 15, he cleared the screening test and took a bus to Kodagu. He developed symptoms on March 17 and was admitted to the isolation ward of a Madikeri hospital.

 
 
Deputy commissioner C Annies Kanmani Joy declared a 500-metre cordon sanitaire around the patient’s house in Kodangeri village, 21km from Madikeri, besides placing 180 of his contacts under home quarantine.

In good news, two patients quarantined at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Bengaluru, are set to be discharged on Friday as they have recovered well. Medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar said a patient must test negative twice in 24 hours before she could be discharged. Once out of the hospital, the person must be in home isolation for 14 days.

The two patients are a 47-year-old woman with no travel history and a 26-year-old man, who returned from his honeymoon trip to Europe. The woman contracted the infection from her husband, who was Karnataka’s first Covid-19 patient, and tested positive on March 9. The Europe returnee tested positive on March 12.
