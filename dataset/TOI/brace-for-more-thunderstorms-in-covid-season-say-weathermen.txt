Kolkata: Brace for more thunderstorms in Covid-19 season, say weathermen
2020-04-28
KOLKATA: A low cloud cover shrouded Kolkata in a haze on Monday morning even as a steady drizzle drenched the city. With the Covid-19 pandemic looming large, the city may receive more thunderstorms over the next four days, said Met officials. 

The city received 9.8mm rain on Monday. A cyclonic circulation in Bangladesh triggered the cloud cover and rain on Monday. It may precipitate more showers and even a squall in the course of the week, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). 

“In fact, the whole of south Bengal and eastern India may receive rain and thunderstorms this week. Apart from the circulation in Bangladesh, there is another one over central India and a high-pressure zone above Bay of Bengal, which is supplying moisture to the systems. We expect both circulations to intensify over the next few days and trigger thunderstorms. Kolkata could receive a squall,” said RMC director, GK Das.

A squall had lashed the city with a wind speed of 70 km/hr last Thursday evening. It led to scattered rain in some parts of the city that remained warm and humid through the day. It was the fourth squall to strike the city since April 11.

“This is the period when norwesters happen. Even though we had none during the first half of the month, systems have now started building up and thunderstorms are in the offing,” said a weather scientist.
