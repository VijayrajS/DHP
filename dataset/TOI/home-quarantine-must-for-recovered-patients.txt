Kolhapur: Medical experts have said that the patients who have recovered from Covid-19 must follow all social distancing and home quarantine guidelines to avoid relapse in the recovery. Experts said that there are no specific guidelines set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on the post-recovery phase, but exercising extreme precautions could avoid any relapse in the recovery.

Minakshi Gajbhiye, dean of Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College and Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Rugnalaya (CPR) told TOI that as many as three patients have recovered from Covid-19 infection and have been discharged. They have been stamped and advised 14-day home quarantine.

“Our first recovered patient, however, developed some pneumonia issues after recovery at home and had to be brought back to one of the private hospitals where he was treated first. As a precautionary measure, we conducted his throat swab test after 21 days of the original infection and tested negative for it, which was a relief,” she said, adding that now another patient, a woman from the Kasba Bawda area, too tested negative for the infection after 14-days of treatment, however, she is also being treated for pneumonia.
