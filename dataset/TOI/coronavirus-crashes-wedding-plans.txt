Coronavirus crashes wedding plans
2020-03-23
Kochi: His daughter's wedding was a dream, and Murali Rajan (name changed) was preparing for a big bash in April. However, the spike in Covid-19 cases and the resultant restrictions imposed by the government have forced a change in plans. 

“In the changed circumstances I am unsure whether it will be possible to hold even a low-key affair. If we are forced to postpone the event, I don't know long we will have to wait,” said Rajan. 

His initial plan was to scale down the event. Instead of the convention centre that was booked, the venue was shifted to a local temple. “Our families are religious and we don’t want to miss the auspicious day that has been chosen. I plan to take a decision after March 31,” he said. 

Why March 31? “Current restrictions are in place till then,” says Rajan. 

He is keeping his friends and relatives updated over phone, email and WhatsApp about the change in plans. With travel restrictions in place Rajan is not keen on visiting them to convey the news. 

Similar sentiments are shared by many families that have scheduled weddings in the months of March and April. 

Lalitha Mohan had scheduled her daughter’s engagement for April 16. “There is so much uncertainty. The family is keen on postponing the event to a future date. But, we are unable to finalize a date,” she said. 

Cancellations and postponements have adversely affected the wedding industry. Most pre-wedding shoots have been cancelled. 

“Families of brides and grooms have already communicated the cancellations or postponements. In most cases they have not given a final date. All large-scale photo shoots are being avoided. In low-key weddings, very few photos are taken, which are mainly for the purpose of documentation,” said Ananthu G Prakesh, a freelance photographer based in Tripunithura.
