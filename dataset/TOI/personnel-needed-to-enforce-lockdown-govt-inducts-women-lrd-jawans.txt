Personnel needed to enforce lockdown, govt inducts women LRD jawans
2020-05-23
Ahmedabad: As the police department has been working round the clock to enforce the lockdown with limited manpower, the state government has begun inducting women Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) jawans in the force. The majority of the 5,000-odd women who had been declared eligible in the examination, have been given the districts where they will be posted.Last month, these women LRD candidates had appealed to the CM to induct them into the police force, so that they could help enforcing the lockdown. The women had said they are willing to donate one month’s salary to the PM’s relief fund if they were inducted.Representatives of the LRD aspirants, who had staged a marathon protest in Gandhinagar that lasted for two months, said that barring Ahmedabad city and the districts of Tapi and Devboomi Dwarka, women who had been declared eligible have already been allotted districts. “For some reason, appointments have been stalled for posts in Ahmedabad city and two other districts. We have appealed to the government to complete the process of appointing women LRD personnel in these places as well,” said Suresh Chaudhary, one of those who were fighting for the cause of the women candidates.Even as women from the reserved categories and non-reserved categories were holding separate dharnas in the state capital, the government announced a formula, where all candidates scoring over 62.5% in the examination were declared passed. Accordingly, 5,227 were to be given appointment orders, but the government had not acted on the decision until this week.Chaudhary said that of the total 5,227 appointments, 1,083 are yet to be made by the government. “Over the past few days, the majority of those who cleared the LRD exam, have been allotted districts where they will work. Some 870 appointments in Ahmedabad city, 186 in Dwarka and 45 in Tapi district are still remaining,” Chaudhary said.
