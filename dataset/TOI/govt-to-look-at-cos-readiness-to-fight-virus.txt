Government to look at companies readiness to fight virus
2020-03-21
MUMBAI: The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) wants companies to file an online-form to confirm their readiness to deal with the Covid-19 threat. This form will be deployed on March 23.


In his address to the nation on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to citizens to work from home and urged employers not to deduct salaries. Following this, the advisory — which is posted on the MCA website — states, “As part of disaster management to meet this urgent and severe health exigency, all companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) are expected and are strongly advised to put in place an immediate plan to implement the work-from-home policy as a temporary measure till March 31, after which the position will be reviewed by appropriate authorities according to the evolving situation.”

It adds that where essential staff is to be on duty, staggered timings may be followed to minimise physical interaction. Preventive health measures must be strictly followed in such instances. “As companies and LLPs are major employers, especially in urban areas, their full cooperation is essential in containing the spread, morbidity and mortality due to the disease,” states this advisory issued by MCA secretary Injeti Srinivas.
