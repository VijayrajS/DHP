Erratic lift lets staff down at Covid unit
2020-05-26
Nashik: Erratic working of the lift at the Covid treatment facility in the Nashik civil hospital is giving a tough time to the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff as well as patients. The lone lift at the three-storey facility for Covid-19 suspects stopped functioning on Monday morning. The Class IV employees at the facility said that this is the second time in a week’s time that the lift has stopped working. “When the lift stops working, the suspected patients who are too weak to climb the stairs, have to be physically carried to the first, second or third floor. This increases the chances of us catching the infection,” said an employee.The Class IV employees get a bedsheet for the patient to lie on, Then two staffers hold the two ends of the bedsheet and take the patient up the stairs.The lift has been developing snags frequently, said the staffers.Civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale, however, said that the lift stopped working only twice in a week’s time. “The electrical engineers of the public works department are available whenever needed. At times, there are delays in the repair work as the engineers do not get spare parts easily.”Jagdale said the lift that had stopped on Monday morning was repaired by 2 pm. The Class IV employees said doctors, nurses and their colleagues have got infected despite taking precautions. The physical handling of patients/suspects increases the chance of catching the infection. Jagdale said they have communicated with the officials of the electricity department of PWD to ensure that such incidents do not recur.
