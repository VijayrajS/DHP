2020-05-27
HYDERABAD: A seven-day-old infant became Telangana’s youngest Covid-19 victim as the baby died three days after developing symptoms, authorities said on Tuesday, even as the state reported 71 new positive cases. The overall caseload was nine short of the 2,000 mark on Tuesday with 1,991 cases.


While the baby passed away on Monday night, tests done after her death revealed she was coronavirus positive. The baby girl was born at the state-run Niloufer Hospital, but was brought back from Quthbullapur after parents felt she was unwell.

While her mother tested negative for the virus before delivery, none of the family members had any symptoms.


Surge in positive cases blamed on movement of people

The baby is suspected to have contacted the virus in the hospital, sources said.

The locality where the family stays has now been declared a containment zone.

The sudden surge in positive cases has been blamed on more movement of people. “It is being observed that there is a lot of mobility and movement of people. There is a surge of positive cases since the past few days,” the state health department said in a statement.

Authorities reiterated several measures to be taken to contain the spread of the virus.

The new cases were reported from the GHMC and Rangareddy district, in addition to cases being reported in Medchal, Narayanpet, Nalgonda and Vikarabad.

Four foreign returnees and 12 migrants have tested positive, apart from 38 patients from GHMC limits. About 120 patients recovered or were discharged on Tuesday. The total number of patients who have recovered in the state is now 1,164, leaving 700 active Covid-19 cases.
