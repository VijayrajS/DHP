Lockdown affecting the dead as well
2020-04-04
Haridwar: Because of the ongoing lockdown, those who have a death in the family are unable to come to Haridwar for immersion of ashes, or to perform other rituals. 

Priests at the Har-ki-Pauri and other Ganga ghats in the holy city said that ‘asthi visarjan’, ‘pind daan’ and other rituals have all stopped owing to the lockdown. At least a hundred families of priests whose livelihood depends on ‘dakshina’ (charity) from pilgrims performing these rituals are struggling to make ends meet, said Akhil Bharatiya Yuva Teerth Purohit Mahasabha president Ujjwal Pundit.

According to Pundit, around 3,000 pilgrims visit Haridwar everyday to perform post- death rituals or rituals for ancestors. With travelling coming to a standstill, due to the lockdown, no rituals are being performed and the priests have no income. 

“We would earn around Rs 500 per day but now we have no earnings,” said Avikshit Raman, a priest who returned to his village in Champawat after the lockdown. He added that there was a rush of people to leave the holy town when the lockdown was announced. 

For those whose family members passed away in the period of the lockdown, it has been tough to perform rituals as well. Kunwar Pal, a resident of Garhmeerpur village near Bahadrabad, said, “A family had come to Har-ki-Pauri on March 27 to immerse their mother’s ashes but police stopped them at Shankaracharya Chowk and they had to return.”

Meanwhile, Ganga Sabha, the apex body of priests in the town, is trying to help those who are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha told TOI that ration and other essential items are being provided to the needy daily at Malviya Dham, Jwalapur and Teerth Purohit Dharmashala, Kankhal. He, however, did not specify the number of beneficiaries. “Despite difficulties, we are following the advisory on lockdown and fully support the government in its struggle against Covid-19,” he said.
