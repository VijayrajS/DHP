2020-05-02
Mhow: Dr BR Ambedkar University of Social Sciences (BRAUSS), Mhow, has written a letter to ministry of human resources and development for starting a course in universities on epidemics and pandemics just like disaster management and environment studies. The university research extension director prof DK Verma has proposed for setting up of epidemic and pandemic research institutions in all universities and epidemic and pandemic prevention centres in all colleges. 

Verma told TOI that he had written this letter 15 days ago and he has received a good response from there. “Any society prospers if it starts working on issues that are affecting it and a study on epidemics and pandemics is the need of the hour, especially for the densely populated countries like India.” TNN
