2020-03-17
AHMEDABAD: The market may be running short of coronavirus masks, but there’s enough at the Ahmedabad Central Jail. Prisoners are making their own face masks at an average count of 1,000 to 1,500 per day. Additional director general of police K L N Rao (Jails) said they have set up a unit for prisoners to make masks.

The Ahmedabad Central jail accommodates about 3,000 to 3,500 prisoners at a time and it is like a small village. “According to the directions issued by the ministry of home affairs, we are taking all steps to ensure that the virus does not make its way into the jail. For that we have set up a small unit to make medical or face masks for jail inmates,” Rao said.


 
Rao added the masks are being made for all 33 jails across the state, but they were ready to make masks for government departments too, if ordered.
