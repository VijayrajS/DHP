TrueNat test to detect Covid-19 at Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik
2020-06-05
NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to conduct TrueNat test for Covid-19 detection at its Zakir Hussain Hospital in the city. 

The state government has provided a machine required for the tests to the civic body and the same is being installed at Zakir Hussain Hospital. 

The machine can test around 25 throat swab samples of high risk contacts every day. This will help the NMC to decide immediately whether to isolate the high risk contacts for further treatment. 

It takes around two-three days to get test reports of the throat swab samples. However, by using TrueNat it will be possible to detect Covid-19 within one-and-a-half hour. If the machine reports comes out as positive, the samples will be then sent to the lab in Pune for confirmation.

This test will also enable the NMC to detect prospective Covid-19 patients from the high risk contacts and start their immediate treatment.

“There have been a rise in Covid-19 positive cases in the city. Once the person is tested positive, we immediately trace out the high risk contacts of the patients and the number is usually high. Hence, it takes time to send their swab samples to the lab in Pune and get reports,” an NMC official said.

“We can conduct test of 25 high risk contacts in one go. If the test detects a person to be Covid-19 positive, we will isolate the high risk contact, start treatment and also send the swab sample to the lab in Pune for confirmation,” the official added.Training is also to be provided to the staff by the experts about tests in a day or two. “We are expecting to start the TrueNat test within a week,” the official said.
