2020-03-05
BIHARSHARIF: The district health department has deputed health workers near Hiuen Tsang Museum in Nalanda to sensitize visitors about coronavirus amid reports of some positive cases in India recently. The health workers have been asked to report to the officials if anyone is found with symptoms of the deadly virus that has claimed over 3,000 lives so far since its outbreak in Wuhan in China in December last year. 

Health worker Radhika Kumari deputed at the awareness cum liaison centre for coronavirus at Nalanda said they had been instructed to report to the district health authorities if any of the visitors is found with cough, fever, throat sore and fatigue, which are symptoms of coronavirus.

Surinder Yadav, a guard at the museum, said the number of foreign visitors had fallen to almost zero in the last one month. He said even domestic visitors sparsely visit there since the outbreak of coronavirus.

A shopkeeper said during October and March, hundreds of foreigners, mostly from China, used to visit Nalanda everyday. But their number had been almost nil since mid-January due to the coronavirus. He said due to fall in the number of visitors to the museum, they have suffered huge losses and were almost on the verge of starvation. He said shopkeepers near the museum were not able to arrange school fees for their children.
