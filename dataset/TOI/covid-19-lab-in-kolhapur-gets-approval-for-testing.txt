2020-04-24
Kolhapur: Guardian minister Satej Patil said on Thursday that the Covid-19 testing laboratory set up at the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College campus in the Shenda Park area in Kolhapur had received the green signal from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). 

Patil added that the laboratory was likely to start testing throat swab samples of Covid-19 suspects from Friday onwards.

According to Patil, the laboratory can test 16 samples within 45 minutes. “Considering this capacity, we can very well test around 160 samples everyday in a span of 10 hour,” said the minister.

On Thursday, Patil, along with district collector Daulat Desai, municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti, Kolhapur zilla parishad CEO Aman Mittal and dean of the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj government medical college Minakshi Gajbhiye, inspected the laboratory. 

Patil said that the funding of the laboratory has been approved from the District planning and development committee (DPDC) and that it would save the district administration a lot of time and also help them in making quick decisions. 

He added that they have got around 200 cartridges for the testing and would be demanding for more in the future. 

Previously, the Kolhapur health department used to send their throat swab samples to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. After the establishment of the testing laboratory in Miraj, the throat swab samples were sent there. However, the current capacity of the Miraj lab is not up to the mark resulting in delaying of test results. 

So far, Kolhapur has recorded 10 Covid-19 cases. Of this tally, two have been discharged, while a few more are on their way to recovery. At present, the number of active cases stands at 8.

Meanwhile, the confirmed Covid-19 positive patient from Kasba Bawda has tested negative for the contagion in the tests conducted post the isolation period and is likely to be discharged on Friday.
