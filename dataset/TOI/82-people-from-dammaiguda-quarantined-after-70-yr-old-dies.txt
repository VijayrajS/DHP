HYDERABAD: As many as 82 people have been quarantined after the death of a 70-year-old due to Covid-19 in Cheriyal, Dammaiguda. 

The person was admitted to a hospital owing to some other ailments and was not aware that he had the virus. He had met his relatives, friends and others in the apartment complex. According to a multi-disciplinary surveillance team, he had even held meetings with the apartment association and senior citizens of the area until April 15.

“The person had multiple health issues related to lungs and kidneys. It was only after he was admitted to hospital that he and his family members discovered about him being infected with coronavirus,” said a police officer. 

“The person was very social and we are tracing his activity from April 1 to April 15 after which he was hospitalised for three days and passed away on April 18,” added the police officer. 

After the person’s death, members of Dammaiguda municipality have decided to shut all shops before noon. The officials said that they will ensure no resident of the village steps out and no outsiders enters the area.

“We have decided that not even a single shop will be open post noon in our locality. People can purchase and stock essentials before that. Already several people in Dammaiguda Municipality (Cheeryal village) have been quarantined and ensuring strict lockdown is the need of hour,” said a resident of Cheriyal, who is also one of the volunteers of the containment zone. 

After police barricaded the place, locals further raised temporary barricades in bylanes and ensured there is only one common point used to enter and exit the village.
