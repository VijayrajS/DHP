2020-04-06
Health minister Vishwajit Rane said on Sunday that coronavirus suspects will be quarantined for 28 days instead of 14 in view of the severity of the disease. 

He said that this has been done on advice of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, and will come into effect immediately. Suspects are quarantined either at home, or in a government facility.

 “The WHO too has recommended the quarantine period to be double the incubation period,” an official said.
