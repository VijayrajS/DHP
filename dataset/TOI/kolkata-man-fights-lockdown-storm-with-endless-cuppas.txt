Kolkata man fights lockdown storm with endless cuppas
2020-04-10
When the lockdown was announced, the first thing that set alarm bells ringing for Khokan Das was whether this would separate him from his beloved tea. The 45-year-old — a self-confessed tea aficionado — downs several cuppas a day. Recently, he chanced upon a viral video that showed a poor labourer facing social media trial for stepping out of his house for a cup of tea. The plight of such people, coupled with his love for the beverage, prompted Khokan to come up with a unique initiative. From March 20, he started serving tea and biscuits to over 500 street dwellers every day. 
“For Bengalis, cha is a sentiment. I can’t imagine a single day without tea. After seeing that video, I instantly decided to help those who are not being able to afford even a cup of tea in the lockdown. While many have come forward to provide food to the needy, I’m serving them tea and biscuits. After all, you need more than dal, chawal and khichdi to survive,” said Khokan. Right in the morning, Khokan assembles 25 litres of milk, a kilo of tea and five to six kilos of sugar to make almost 100 litres of tea. He adds all these ingredients in a huge pot and spends over an hour to prepare tea at his Shyam Pukur Street residence since his guest house is currently shut. 
“Initially, people from the nearby slums would gather in front of my house to collect tea, but now I go to the slums and street dwellers myself to avoid any kind of risk. Though some of them are still coming, it’ll stop soon. I’m taking all possible precautions.,” he added. 
Despite two workers from the local tea shop joining him in his noble initiative, the task at hand is not easy. Khokan is bearing all the expenses out of his own pocket, which is over `2,500 per day.
