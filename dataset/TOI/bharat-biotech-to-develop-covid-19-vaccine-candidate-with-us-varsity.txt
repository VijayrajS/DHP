2020-05-21
HYDERABAD: City-based vaccine maker Bharat Biotech on Wednesday said it has signed an exclusive deal with Thomas Jefferson University of Philadelphia for the development of a new vaccine candidate for Covid-19. The vaccine was invented by infectious diseases expert Professor Matthias Schnell’s lab at the university in January this year.


Bharat Biotech aims to get into human trials for the vaccine as early as December 2020 with support from the Department of Biotechnology. The vaccine, which has recently completed preliminary tests in animal models and uses a deactivated rabies vaccine, showed a strong antibody response in mice. 

 

“Our partnership with Bharat Biotech will accelerate the development of our vaccine candidate. We will be able to complete animal testing and move to phase 1 clinical trial rapidly,” said ProSchnell, a coronavirus expert who directs The Jefferson Vaccine Institute and chairs Jefferson’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology.

Bharat Biotech CEO Dr Krishna Mohan said, “The basic proof of concept has been established while using it for other pandemic infectious diseases. Bharat Biotech is committed to global public health and will be involved in an end-to-end development of the vaccine.”
