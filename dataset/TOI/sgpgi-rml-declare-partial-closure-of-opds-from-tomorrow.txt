LUCKNOW: Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) have decided to suspend several OPD services from Monday till further orders.

Director, SGPGI, Dr RK Dhiman said the decision was taken on the state government’s directives to avoid overcrowding and check spread of coronavirus infection.

“Besides dialysis services, only neonatal and cancer OPDs will run. Stable patients are being discharged and only critical cases will be admitted,” he said.

Director, RMLIMS, Prof AK Tripathi said emergency services in antenatal, neonatal, cancer, cardiology, urology, neurology, gastro-surgery, nephrology, dialysis, urosurgery and cancer departments will operate round the clock.

General emergency will also run. Emergency helplines are 0522-6692000, 6692001 and 6692002. Daily, at least 1,000 patients visit general OPDs of RMLIMS and 6,000 at SGPGIMS. Many come from various parts of the state and are confused if theirs is an emergency case.
