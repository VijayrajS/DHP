Trichy: A 22-year-old engineering student who has invented an air purifier that can detect the presence of coronavirus in an enclosed space has won the first prize at the Social Entrepreneurship Pitch Fest. The fest was held on the theme ‘Current and future social challenges posed by Covid-19’ and organised by the Department of Social Entrepreneurship of the Madras School of Social Work (MSSW), Chennai. Shalom Kingson, founder of Carbonhubs – a startup that works on controlling air pollution- had started his research on microbial disinfection long before the outbreak of Covid-19. “My idea was to prevent the cycle of infection like cold or cough among a group of people, be it at a school or an organisation, using an air purifier. The air purifier I initially devised trapped the bacteria or virus present in a closed space and prevented it from spreading to others,” Kingson said.As Covid-19 outbreak occurred early this year, he made some changes to his air purifier enabling it to detect coronavirus. The device will cost about Rs 1.5 lakh and can indicate the presence of the virus in a closed space so that people can take precautions to prevent it from spreading to more people. Shalom received a cash prize of Rs 7,500 for his idea. Piyush Poddar, another participant from New Delhi, was feted for his ‘Half Notebook’ initiative which aims to make notebooks from one-side used paper, which otherwise finds its way into the trash cans. The initiative promotes the idea of ‘reuse’ and such notebooks are provided free of cost to underprivileged children. The fest received over 130 entries from across the country. The ideas went through a rigorous round of screening in areas like intensity of the issue addressed, their proposed innovative solution to the problem and on the sustainability of their social entrepreneurship working model.
