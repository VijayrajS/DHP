Covid-19 in Mumbai: Doctors’ body criticises test report delays, lack of standard protocol
2020-05-11
MUMBAI: A private doctors’ body, the Association of Medical Consultants (AMC), said in a scathing letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray that Covid-19 test reports took as many as seven days and uniform protocols were missing for testing and isolation.

Still, 1,172 private doctors responded to the DMER call to offer their services to fight Covid-19. “Over 450 have said they would like to be posted in hospitals in the western suburbs, around 350 said they would prefer south Mumbai hospitals, while another 300 wished to work in central suburbs,” Dr T P Lahane, director of DMER, said.

The AMC, which represents around 12,000 specialists and super-specialists, said doctors were willing to serve but processes on the ground need to be streamlined in all of Mumbai Metropolitan Region. It said unavailability of real-time information on hospital beds was not allowing them to guide pregnant women or patients in need of dialysis. Information about these facilities was poorly propagated, said the letter.

The letter said lab report delays caused late initiation of treatment as well as discharge. In the city, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the turnaround time of reports was between 24 hours and 48 hours.

The AMC said personal protective equipment were not available in adequate numbers at KEM, Sion, Nair and other civic hospitals.

It said hospitals with non-Covid patients continue to be “wrongly sealed for 14 days by local health authorities”.

“We have hospitals in Vasai-Virar, Palghar that have been sealed and nurses put under quarantine despite not being exposed,” Dr Deepak Baid, president, AMC, said.

He said that outside the city, hospitals had been taken over without proper MoUs and doctors posted on ICU duty without any insurance or remuneration.
