KOLKATA: The results of several officers from police stations in central and north-central Kolkata who had been tested for Covid-19 have come negative. Police personnel have been on the frontline to contain the spread of the virus in areas like Posta, Burrabazar, Muktarambabu Street, Madan Mohan Burman Street, Rabindra Sarani, Armenian Street and Canning Street, where multiple cases of Covid-19 have emerged. 

Samples from cops in police stations like Jorasanko, Jorabagan, Posta and Bowbazar were sent for tests when some of their colleagues tested positive. “It is a huge relief for us that all of them have tested negative. Most of them have been working since the beginning and know the affected areas very well,” said a senior officer. 

Cops have been posted in various hotspots in these pockets to enforce lockdown and implement social distancing.
