2020-03-11
NASHIK: A 23-year-old woman, who returned to the city from Dubai around a week ago, and her mother were on Tuesday admitted to the isolation ward of the civic hospital as they were suffering from cold and cough — symptoms of coronavirus.


A senior health department official said that the mother-daughter duo were admitted to the isolation ward as a precautionary measure because one of them had visited the Gulf region, where coronavirus cases have been rising.

Dubai is a part of the UAE, which has reported 74 infections across the country so far.

Nikhil Saindane, additional civil surgeon of Nashik civil hospital, said the woman returned from Dubai on March 4. “On Monday, she started suffering from cold and cough, following which she went to the Bytco Hospital. She was on Tuesday referred to the civil hospital to check if she had caught coronavirus,” he said.

“Since the mother is also suffering from cold and cough, we got her too admitted to the isolation ward as a precautionary measure. Their swabs have been sent to the NIV for tests and the reports will be available by Wednesday,” said Saindane.

Civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale said the woman had gone to Dubai to attend a Satsang programme and that she was in the emirate for seven to eight days.

“Apart from the mother-daughter duo and another patient in the isolation ward, there are 17 travellers from affected countries whose health is being monitored by us at their homes on a daily basis,” he said. 

“The travellers concerned have been asked to not move out of their house for 14 days as the virus dies in a person’s body in that period,” added Jagdale.
