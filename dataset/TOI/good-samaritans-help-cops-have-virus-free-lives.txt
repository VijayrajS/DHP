Good Samaritans help cops have virus-free lives
2020-03-30
Vadodara: Many in the city are distributing food and grocery kits to poor, some drinking water while others masks. But there are some who have taken the onus of providing free disinfecting services to police stations and giving sanitizers that are difficult to find to the cops.

Police stations witness movement of both police personnel and others. They cannot be shutdown like other offices and cops remain on duty overtime. Cops also come in close contact with many while distributing food or preventing them from violating the lockdown.

In the wake of the situation, a city-based entrepreneur has started disinfecting police stations and even vehicles used by the police. “We had introduced disinfecting as a service as we are already into laundry services, house cleaning, sofa and upholstery sanitization,” said entrepreneur Pradeep Sharma.

However, when their team was returning after sanitizing a school in Warasiya area, cops stopped the team on seeing the equipment. “They asked us details and then requested us to do the same for their police station. The lockdown began the very next day and we decided that we should provide the service for free to the police as they were at risk,” he said.

Sharma’s team has so far sanitized the police commissioner’s office, his residence, police stations and outposts as well as police vehicles. “They are working overtime and we cannot afford to let them fall ill,” said Sharma.

At the other end, Savli-based company Indo Amines Ltd has arranged 20,000 bottles of sanitizers for policemen and other personnel out in the field. The employees and top management of the company started distributing 200ml bottles on Monday and will continue doing so. They are also flooded with demands for arranging more such bottles. The company has ordered more bottles of sanitizers and assured the men in uniform that the supply will continue.
