‘To show all well, testing stopped’
2020-06-07
Panaji: With novel coronavirus cases in the state rising, the state government has discreetly stopped testing residents of Mangor in order to suggest that all is well in Goa,” Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai alleged.

Sardesai said that by halting tests, the state government is putting Goans at risk.

“As Goa scores double century, Goemkars ask why, unofficially, testing stopped at Mangor. Why 2,000-odd tests that chief minister Pramod Sawant promised are not happening,” Sardesai said.

Sardesai said that the state’s slackness in testing lacked “scientific logic” and was aimed only to please “Delhi bosses by getting the well-heeled here”.

“SOPs have become a joke! Goemkars question whether abbreviation stands for Sawant Operating Procedures where human error leading to importing COVID19 without testing has put whole Goa at risk,” said Sardesai. 

Declared a containment zone on Monday following two cases, Mangor Hill saw a drastic rise in cases in the subsequent days, with the highest spike of 62 recorded on Saturday.
