2020-04-20
Ramgarh: The district administration has intensified vigil along its borders, especially for pedestrians and cyclists who are trying to enter into the district, apart from people travelling in vehicles. DC Sandeep Singh told TOI on Sunday that the move is to restrict unwanted entry of anyone into the district to prevent spread of the coronavirus infection. He, however, added that Ramgarh has no report of Covid-19 positive case, so far. 

Earlier, three persons, including two women, slipped into Chitarpur block on foot from Ranchiâ€™s Hindpiri, a Covid-19 hotspot, sending everyone into tizzy. Administrative officials swung into action on time and sent them to a quarantine centre set up at an old-age home here. 

Meanwhile, a private doctor from Gola block in Ramgarh was put under a 21-day home quarantine on Sunday after a patient he came in contact with died of Covid-19 in Gurgaon on Saturday. The doctor, who divides his time between Ranchi and Ramgarh, had attended to the deceased in Bariatu before the latter was airlifted to Gurgaon.
