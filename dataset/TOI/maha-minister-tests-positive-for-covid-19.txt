THANE: A state minister who was under treatment at a private hospital for fever, tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday. He is the first member of the Maharashtra cabinet to be hospitalised for the infection. 


The minister was initially admitted to a private hospital in Thane on Tuesday and later shifted to Mumbai, where he was kept in ICU.

Earlier this month, 16 people working at the minister’s bungalow had tested positive. Following this, the minister put himself in home quarantine though he had tested negative then. Also, two of his associates—a former corporator and an ex MP—and the MP’s wife have tested positive.

On Tuesday, the minister was admitted to a private hospital in Thane with symptoms including fever and later shifted to a hospital in Mulund. His reports came positive on Thursday.

“The cabinet minister has tested positive and is taking treatment in Mumbai. His family members are in home quarantine. We suspect he might have got the infection from the positive patients he was in contact with,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation.

Milind Narvekar, Shiv Sena secretary and a friend of the minister, said he was responding well to treatment. “His health has improved. He spoke to his wife and daughter on Wednesday and Thursday over phone and spoke with me as well,” said Narvekar.
