2020-03-29
Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urging him to take measures like granting of Rs 1 lakh crore to states to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and problems during the lockdown to stop the spread of the disease.The first instalment of the grant should be given to states based on per person population. Later, the grant amount can be given more to the states where the infection rate is high, and proportionally to the remaining states, the chief minister said in his letter to Modi. Gehlot, while extending gratitude to the prime minister for announcing an economic package in the wake of the pandemic, said the Centre and states have to jointly fight it.He said the Centre should direct the Reserve Bank of India to provide Rs 1 lakh crore to states as an interest-free advance. This should be done for 11 months from April 1, the chief minister said in his letter. He mentioned that economies of the states have been adversely affected due to the pandemic.Noting the huge decline in tax and non-tax revenue, he said permission for additional two per cent credit limit should be given immediately from the Net Credit Limit which the states get.The chief minister said states expect that the Centre should grant moratorium of at least three months in the payment of instalments due to the RBI and other financial institutions. Chief minister said the state government had increased expenses in the health sector and has taken measures to stop the effect of this pandemic. He said the Centre has the power to use monetary, fiscal and credit policies to raise money, which the state governments do not have. Therefore, the states should be provided with sufficient financial resources to deal with continuous changing situations due to the virus attack.
