Nagpur: The 55-year-old Chandrapur man, who died yesterday at Mayo Hospital, was not infected by novel coronavirus. His swab samples, collected right before his death, tested negative on Tuesday. Doctors said he died of viral pneumonia, and not of Covid-19.

The person was admitted in a private hospital at Ramdaspeth for two days. Being a pneumonia case, the private practitioner treating him referred him for the Covid-19 tests.

“We received a communication from the NMC health department on Tuesday morning that the person tested negative for Covid-19. It was a great relief for all of us,” said the doctor. As a precautionary measure, NMC authorities had sanitized the entire private hospital late on Monday night itself. Authorities had also planned to seal this hospital and shift admitted patients from here in case the person had tested positive.

“But, there is no need to seal our premises now. We are back at work and serving patients. NMC officials have collected swab samples of doctors and health workers who treated the deceased during the two days. But since he himself tested negative, their test reports are also irrelevant now,” the doctor said.

According to him, the deceased was a patient of viral pneumonia. He had other problems like obesity and hypertension. He came to Nagpur in a serious condition. Following protocol and new ICMR guidelines, he was referred for the Covid-19 tests. He did not have any travel history since long.
