KANNUR: A 28-year-old newly-wed from Panoor in Kannur died of Covid-19 in the early hours of Saturday in Saudi Arabia. 

According to his family and relatives, the man, identified as P K Shebnaz, son of Mammu and Fousiya, residents of Meethale Pookkom in Panoor municipality, had been undergoing treatment at Saudi German Hospital Madinah for the past one week and died around 11.30pm local time on the night of April 3 (around 2am IST on Saturday). 

A couple of days ago his friends confirmed that he had tested positive but they never thought he was in a critical condition, said Nizar K, who is close to the family and a member of Panoor municipality. Shebnaz was working with the KFC fast food restaurant chain in Madinah.

However, the Saudi officials have not yet officially confirmed that he died of Covid-19, said Nizar.

Shebnaz's father Mammu said his son got married on January 5 this year, and had gone back after marriage on the night of March 2. Last week he was admitted in the hospital following fever. He was not having any other health problem earlier, said the father.

Since the body could not be brought here, the family has sent the consent for funeral there, said the family.

Meanwhile, the health condition of two Malayalis from Kasaragod, who have been admitted to the same hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, is improving, said hospital sources.
