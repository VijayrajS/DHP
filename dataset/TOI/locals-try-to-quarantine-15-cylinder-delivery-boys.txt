KOLKATA: Around 15 delivery boys of an Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) distributor at Sulekha More near Jadavpur were stopped by locals in Diamond Harbour on Wednesday when they were heading towards home in two vehicles to give money to their families. They were taken to the local police station and then to a health centre for quarantine. However, they were released only after a call from the IOC called the district administration regarding the matter.


Oil marketing firms like IOCL, Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and HP have complained their delivery boys in Kolkata are being harassed when they visit homes on the outskirts. The three firms have nearly 10,000 delivery boys while around 6,000 of them belong to Kolkata distributors and over 60% of them are from neighbouring districts. 

In rural towns, delivery boys are not facing such problem as they are mostly local. The IOCL chief general manager (LPG) Abhijit Dey said the main problem is with delivery boys in the Kolkata metro area. 

“Here most of the delivery boys of our distributors are from adjacent districts like two 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly. We have asked the distributors to provide them with pick and drop facility. Many of them stay with the distributors as well,” he added. Dey also assured there is adequate availability of cylinders. “The delivery boys are doing a good job,” he said.
