LUCKNOW: A 26-year-old nurse at the Queen Mary’s Hospital (QMH) tested positive for novel coronavirus infection on Monday.

She was a part of the team which performed emergency C-section surgery on a Covid-19 positive woman on Friday. The nurse was in “active quarantine” with other team members and worked in the ward (labour room) till Sunday. She is the 10th medical personnel in the city to test positive. So far, 306 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the city.
 

The female patient was admitted to QMH on Thursday and her emergency surgery was done on Friday. She was isolated after testing positive to Covid-19 on Saturday. However, KGMU authorities said it was not clear how the nurse got infected.

Chief medical superintendent (CMS), QMH, Prof SP Jaiswar said, “After the pregnant woman tested positive, at least 57 people, including 25 doctors, 11 nurses/paramedics and 21 patients, were tested. Only the nurse tested positive.”

“The nurse was tested positive two days after being exposed to risk. The incubation period of the virus is 3-5 days, hence, the possibility of her getting infection from the patient is low,” she added. “The nurse told us that her 18-year-old niece had flu-like symptoms for last four days, which makes her niece a suspected case of Covid-19. The picture will be clear once her report arrives,” the CMS said. However, when contacted, the nurse, who is admitted in KGMU’s Covid-19 ward, said: “My niece did not step out of the house during lockdown. I came for duty all this while I was exposed to the risk of infection more than my niece.”

She claimed nurses were not given protective gear till the woman came out positive. The hospital authorities, however, denied allegations.

When asked why the nurse worked till Sunday as it exposed staff and patients to risk, KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said all the staff members would be tested again after five days.

CMO, Lucknow, Dr Narendra Agarwal said, “The nurse lives with her niece in Nishatganj and went home after Thursday’s surgery. Her sister and brother-in-law came from Gonda to visit her the same day. We have asked the CMO of Gonda to quarantine them.”
