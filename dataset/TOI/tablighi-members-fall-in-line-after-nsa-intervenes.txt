Delhi: Tablighi Jamaat members fall in line after NSA intervenes
2020-04-02
NEW DELHI: On March 28, a section of Tablighi Jamaat members at Nizamuddin refused to let police and other officials enter Alami Markaz to conduct a medical examination. They locked themselves in and a confrontation seemed imminent by midnight, said an intelligence official.


It was then that Union home minister Amit Shah asked national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval to step in. Around 1.30am, Doval reached the spot with five-six ministry and intelligence officials. 

A source said Doval clearly told the religious heads that they would have to follow the rule of the land. He explained it to them that the virus would not target anyone based on religion and, hence, they should get themselves checked in their own interest, the source added. Doval, it is learnt, also spoke to some foreign-based members asking them to extend full cooperation with the law enforcement authorities.

The Tablighi members held an internal meeting in the early hours before agreeing to be shifted to hospitals and quarantine centres in batches. Police then noted down their particulars and began the evacuation process. It took the cops around 100 hours to shift everyone.

The 75-year-old NSA went to the spot despite many advising him to avoid Nizamuddin, which was suspected to be heavily affected by the highly contagious novel coronavirus, said an intelligence official.

During the recent riots in northeast Delhi, too, Doval had patrolled the district along with newly appointed police commissioner S N Shrivastava to ensure violence stopped completely.
