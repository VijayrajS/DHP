2020-03-20
BHOPAL: About 750 plus beds have been identified for the isolation of coronavirus-infected patients by the MP health department. Besides that, there are just about 2.5 intensive care unit (ICU) beds for every one lakh population in Madhya Pradesh, going by a 2017 assessment.


As witnessed in Italy and before that in China, where the COVID-19 outbreak has been severe, there is a requirement of minimally manual ICU care to avoid the spread of the contagion. For those with acute respiratory distress and other complications, level 2 or above ICU units are needed, explained a public health expert with the Union government. 

Of the total number of ICU beds, 250 are in level 1, 1,141 are in level 2, and 425 are in level 3 facilities. This amounts to 0.34, 1.57, and 0.59 ICU beds per 1,00,000 population for levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively, according a study released in 2017 in the Indian journal of critical care medicine. The study was conducted by Dr Saurabh Saigal, JP Sharma, A Pakhare, S Bhaskar, S Dhanuka, S Kumar, S Sabde, Dr Pradip Bhattacharya and Dr Rajnish Joshi.

The health department estimates that there are 751 dedicated beds for COVID-19 treatment with 104 ventilators. All tertiary care hospitals will be treatment centres. District hospitals and others will act as screening centres.

With little over 4,000 doctors in the MP government-run hospitals, the infection risk and rate of COVID-19 infection in medical staff is very high. MP has 1,867 healthcare centres/hospitals under the health department. There are 1,420 PHCs, 324 CHCs, 72 SDH and 51 DH, according to a 2018 assessment.

There are 38,140 beds in the health department-run hospitals. Most of these, almost one-third, are for maternity/child care. Of these, 10,020 beds are in rural areas. AYUSH has 690 beds while seven defence hospitals have a total 1,402 beds. WCR railways has about 456 beds, of which 250 are in MP.
