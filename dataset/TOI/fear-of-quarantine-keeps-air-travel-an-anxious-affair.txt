JAIPUR: Fearing quarantine post landing and anxiety among people over whether it would be safe travelling to various cities, the restoration of domestic air travel from Jaipur remained a low key affair. 

Jaipur airport got 11 flight arrivals while only eight flights departed to various destinations. However, those who travelled were happy on the restoration of flights and were careful to the extent that many passengers were seen wearing masks, face shields and even PPE kits when they arrived at the Jaipur airport.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur had though planned 21 arrivals and same 17 departures, but due to poor passenger load only 11 flight arrivals happened while eight departing flights were cancelled. 

As the flights were restored after 62 days, the happiness on the faces of passengers leaving or landing in Jaipur was evident. 

TOI spoke to many passengers at the airport who were careful and had every safety gear with them while they entered the Jaipur airport. “My mother Prem Lata Sehti came to us on March 8. However, due to lockdown she was stuck here. Now she is travelling to Bangalore,” said Anamika and her husband Rohit Kataria at the airport. 

Another flyer Nirbhay Kumar, a teacher of Kendriya Vidhyalaya at Jaisalmer, had to rush to Lucknow since he lost his brother on Sunday. “I am going to Delhi from where I might get a flight or train. Though in normal course, I would have avoided plane journey but this is an emergency for me,” he said. 

A passenger who arrived from Hyderabad was seen wearing a PPE kit. “One has to be careful,” he laughed and got into the taxi he had hired.
