100 persons on train with Covid+ to be retested today
2020-05-21
Margao: Doctors on Thursday will retest around 100-odd passengers who travelled on the Sunday Rajdhani train to Goa, and who either came in contact with or travelled in the same compartments as the 12 who tested positive. 

The train arrived with passengers from Delhi and Maharashtra. 

The 100-odd contacts, who will be tested, are presently under institutional quarantine. Doctors will take their throat swab samples again for TruNat testing following which they will be stamped for 14-day home quarantine if they test negative.

If they test positive, their swabs — this time nasopharyngeal — will have to be taken in Margao itself and sent to GMC for the confirmatory PCR test only after which will they be labelled Covid-19 positive and admitted to the Margao hospital. 

Contact tracing was carried out on Tuesday during which around 100 contacts, who travelled in the same compartments as the nine who tested positive on the Delhi-Goa Rajdhani Express, were tested. Two contacts of the 100-odd tested were detected positive and were admitted to the Covid-19 hospital on Wednesday.

Should positive cases be detected among air travellers, those who sat besides them as well as those who occupied seats in the three rows ahead of them and three rows behind them will also be quarantined and retested after 72 hours, an official said. 

The same procedure is likely to be followed for those who travel by bus and test positive.
