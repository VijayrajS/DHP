Lockdown brings out the messiah in Vadodara cops
2020-04-18
Vadodara: At 7 am, she resumes duty and serves eight hours on the trot with her colleagues on the city roads amid the lockdown. But even after reaching home, police sub-inspector, H D Vyas has no time to take rest. She freshens up a bit and reaches the city police headquarters in her khakhis to serve another duty — cook food! 

Vyas and a team of eight women cops have been tirelessly preparing food for hundreds of homeless persons in the city. “Since the lockdown, those people staying under the flyovers and by the roadside are in a terrible shape. They don’t have access to food and many of them go hungry. We had been getting calls from many citizens who have pointed out their pathetic condition,” said Saroj Kumari, DCP (administration and HQ).

“Our teams who patrol the city too noticed how the hapless roadside dwellers were going hungry. So we decided to feed them. A team of women cops agreed to prepare food after their duty hours. It is a great gesture from them in this hour of crisis,” Kumari told TOI. 

The women cops include a PSI, head constables and constables who prepare puri-bhaaji, rice and other items which is later served to over 400 homeless persons in different areas of the city for dinner. 

The police said that it takes every possible precaution to ensure that the food is prepeared hygienically. “Many homeless persons are unable to get food so we decided to put in extra hours for ensuring that they don’t go hungry. Yes, it’s tad tiring to cook for so many people after finishing duty hours, but if we don’t do it the needy will go to sleep with empty stomachs. This is the humane side of the cops. We just don’t control crime. We also help people in the time of crisis,” Vyas added.
