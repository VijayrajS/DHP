Villages abide by lockdown, fence entry and exit
2020-04-01
TRICHY: While the city folks were seen flouting the physical distancing rule while purchasing essentials from meat and vegetable markets here, their counterparts in Ariyalur and Karur villages have shown the way to combat Covid-19 by fencing their entry and exit points to prevent outsiders from venturing into their village and also avoid residents from leaving. 


“Villagers are extremely cooperative to section 144 imposed by the state government. The movement of people within the villages has come down drastically,” said P Kannan, vice-president of Unjini panchayat. People in around 1,400 houses in Unjini panchayat, not completely relying on the rural civic body for taking up preventive measures, disinfect their houses with turmeric water. The panchayat has also sprayed natural disinfectant using neem leaves paste on public roads and near water tanks. 

In the city, even on Tuesday, people as couples were seen visiting makeshift markets set by the district administration. Maduram school ground and Cauvery bridge markets saw multiple members of families thronging vegetable markets. “Though the authorities had made circular markings to maintain social distancing, people come as a family to purchase vegetables,” said S Ramachandran, a vegetable vendor. Since milk and vegetables are available nearby, villagers said that they hardly go out of their houses. “We move out only to check our agriculture fields. Villagers abide by the lockdown,” said P Balakrishnan, a farmer from Pettavaithalai.
