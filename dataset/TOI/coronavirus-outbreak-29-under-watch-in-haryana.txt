2020-02-03
CHANDIGARH: With 16 more Haryana residents who returned from China in the past fortnight being put under medical watch for coronavirus, their number has reached 29. 


The state health department took samples of four more persons with suspected symptoms of the deadly viral disease on Saturday. These persons include two from Panchkula, one each from Gurgaon and Karnal.

The department officials said the ones from Panchkula have travel history from Wuhan, while the other two were found to be symptomatic anyhow. 

"The samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for testing. The Panipat resident whose sample was sent to NIV on January 31 has tested negative," a health official said.

In a bid to intensify the screening, the state health department has also set up special check posts on the national highways connecting to Delhi. 

Besides this, hospitals have been provided with self-declaration forms for the persons who volunteer for screening for coronavirus.
