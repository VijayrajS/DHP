Kolkata: Five Kolkata Municipal Corporation medical officers who came in contact with Covid-positive patients at civic health clinics across the city have been placed under home quarantine. According to KMC sources, they had either examined or treated patients, who later tested positive, at KMC clinics.

According to a senior KMC official, civic health officials in large parts of north and central Kolkata are scared after three medical officers were put in home quarantine from north and central Kolkata. “One of our medical officers in the Burrabazar area was the first in north-central zone to treat a patient, who later tested positive. We advised the doctor to stay under home isolation. Four others in Belgachhia-Tallah zone, Narkeldanga, Raja Debendra Street and Bowbazar were sent to home quarantine too,” said a KMC health department official.

Non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for on-duty medical officers at KMC clinics has left a section of civic doctors apprehensive. State health department officials, however, said adequate PPE have been provided to the KMC. 

A section of KMC medical officers has decided to stay home instead of attending clinics in high-risk zones. “The scare among a section of our medical officers is not unjustified. However, people need their services and they should attend the clinics,” an official said.

After discussing the matter with the senior officials, the civic brass decided to ask a section of the medical officers in high-risk Covid-19 zones to be available on phone for the patients of their respective clinics. Most of them subscribed to the idea. They said it would be the best for residents who may get infected by coming in close contact with a doctor at the clinic who could be a silent carrier.
