THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan reiterated the importance of social distancing as well as adhering to health advisories and said failure to do so might force the government to contemplate stricter measures, even as 12 more persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Kerala on Saturday, taking the number of such cases in the state to 52.

All 12 cases reported on Saturday either returned from Gulf countries recently or are their close relatives. Among the new cases, six were reported in Kasaragod and three each in Kannur and Ernakulam districts, Vijayan told reporters here.

Applauding the support extended by various community and religious leaders for checking the spread of coronavirus, the CM, however, warned of strict action against the few who flouted the rules and continued to organise festivals and religious gatherings. “If advisories are flouted, the government would be forced to tighten security measures and invoke even prohibitory orders…. Those who break the declaration for home quarantine, signed at the time of leaving airports, would also have to face serious consequences. Such people not only risk their lives but pose threat to the lives of others'', he said.

The CM said the government was exploring options to open Covid-19 testing facilities in private labs with required infrastructure facilities. Seventy Covid-19 suspects were admitted to hospitals on Saturday. With this, the number of persons under hospital quarantine has reached 228. As many as 52,285 persons are under home quarantine.

Dismissing fears in this regard, the CM assured the availability of essential commodities in the coming days.
