Aurangabad: Even after a formal announcement about a week back, the lab testing facility for Covid-19 at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) is yet to start its operations. 

District guardian minister Subhash Desai had visited the Covid testing lab at Bamu on May 30 and had declared the capacity of the lab to test around 1,000 samples per day. 

Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said, “The lab could not start due to the absence of certain infrastructure. It is expected to be available shortly.”

The facility would have 23 staff members.
