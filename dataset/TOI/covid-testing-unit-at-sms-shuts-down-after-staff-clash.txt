2020-05-19
Jaipur: A scuffle between doctors and lab technicians at the microbiology department of the Sawai Man Singh Hospital here led to the shutting down of its Covid-19 testing unit on Monday.

Health department suspended the services of lab technician Ramesh Kumawat for allegedly thrashing the doctors. Following this, lab technicians have threatened to go on a statewide strike which could seriously affect Covid testing in the state.

SMS Hospital’s microbiology lab has 500 technicians and their strength in the state is 2,700.

Assistant professor at the microbiology department, Dinesh Jain said, “The incident happened (at around at 2.45pm) when I asked a lab technician why he had come late to duty. The timing of the shift starts at noon but he came around 2.45pm. He started arguing and picked up a mop and hit me.” Jain said the doctors will not return to work unless action was taken against Kumawat.
