Dentists in Hyderabad among most vulnerable to virus
2020-04-29
HYDERABAD: The coronavirus pandemic, which has adversely affected several sectors across the world, has proven to be a blow to the dental profession as well. Dentists in the city are a worried lot as it not only makes them vulnerable but, post lockdown, they will also need to upgrade their clinics/hospitals, thereby escalating the cost of consultation.


Dr Parth Satwalekar feels the virus has thrown dentistry a bit of a googly. “Dentists are one of the most vulnerable people as we work directly in the mouth. The mouth naturally teems with microorganisms and so we are trained in infection control and take due precautions, but the transmissibility of Covid-19 is unprecedented. The cost of procedures is in for an increase, which, coupled with reduced spending power and apprehension of the population makes for a bleak future. We will all have to adapt to the new normal, challenging times lie ahead,” Dr Satwalekar, who is a former First Class cricketer and presently a member of the HCA’s Apex Council, told TOI.




“Today there is a big dilemma for dentists where to start. The average dentist is confused with what to do after the lockdown is lifted. He just cannot continue the practice where he had left on March 22. Any patient sitting in the dental chair can be an unknown carrier and there are high chances that infection can spread to doctors, staff, other patients or front office staff etc,” said Dr G Chandra Sekhar, professor and head, Panineeya Dental College & Hospital.

"This will put lot of pressure and viable issues to the profession especially to the newly established practices. The professionals and supporting staff need additional training and learning for successfully running a safe dental profession,” said Dr K Mahendranadh Reddy.
