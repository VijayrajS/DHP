LUCKNOW: Three prominent scientific institutes in the city will soon start Covid-19 testing facility in their labs.

The three institutes — Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP), Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) and National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) — have been paired with private and government hospitals which do not have testing facility or where labs are overburdened. Once functional, these three labs will together test 300 samples daily.

BSIP, which comes under the department of science and technology (DST), has completed all formalities and is waiting for supply of samples. IITR and NBRI will also start testing soon. On April 2, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had given a go ahead to DST and CSIR to allow their labs to start testing at their responsibility, provided they follow all guidelines. 

All labs will have to upload testing data in real time on ICMR and government of India websites. BSIP director Vandana Prasad said the institute had advanced bio-safety lab (BSL2A) and procured diagnostic and PPE kits for the six-member expert team – three each from BSIP and a private lab – to conduct the tests. “We are uploading documents on ICMR website to get login and password for uploading of test results,” she added.

IITR director Alok Dhawan said “The RNA extraction machine needed for tests will arrive in a week. The nodal agency has paired us with Hind Institute of Medical Sciences, Barabanki.”

NBRI director Prof SK Barik said the institute’s lab was being readied and training of scientists would start soon. “Order for RNA extraction machine has been placed. We will be fully ready in 3-4 weeks. KGMU has paired us with Era’s Medical College and hospital,” he said.
