Pithoragarh: Four suspected novel coronavirus patients, including two Chinese nationals, were admitted to district hospital in Pithoragarh for tests on Saturday. After preliminary examination, they were sent to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Delhi, for further check-ups. 

The two Chinese nationals work at a company as consultants. The firm is involved in the construction of a power station at Bagarihat in Didihat tehsil. 

They are in their 30s, and had recently gone home to China and returned to Uttarakhand a few days ago. When they complained of fever-like symptoms, they were taken to district hospital. Two of their Indian colleagues who complained of similar symptoms have also been admitted in hospital.

Chief medical superintendent of Pithoragarh HS Kharayat said that all the four patients had cold and cough, and were kept in an isolated ward and the required tests were being conducted. 

Both the Chinese nationals reside around 500 km away from the virus-hit city of Wuhan and had come to India only a month ago. There were no advisory issued by the Government of India at that time, so no medical checkups were conducted at the airport, he added.

Two other patients also worked in the same company and stayed with them, said Kharayat. 

“The hospital is now sending blood samples to virology laboratory and advised the four persons to be kept in an isolated ward but they insisted on going to Delhi for further check-ups,” Kharayat said. 

“Officials of their company first discussed the matter with district administration. They then requested for permission to be allowed to go to a higher medical facility for further check-ups. After district administration’s nod, they were sent to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi,” said Vijay Kumar Jogdende, DM Pithoragarh.
