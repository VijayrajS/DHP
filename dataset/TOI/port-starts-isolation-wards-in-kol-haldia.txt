KOLKATA: The Kolkata port has stopped shore leave for all crew members, irrespective of their nationality or last port of call. This decision was taken a fortnight ago following instructions from the Centre, said Vinit Kumar, chairman of Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust.

Shipping agents have been instructed to adopt all protective measures when boarding ships in Kolkata, Haldia, Budge Budge and smaller jetties. Screening of all crew continued and information was being shared with all agencies, Kumar said. 

“Since January 29, we have screened 8,145 crew members of 470 ships. At smaller jetties, screening is being conducted by Inland Waterways Transport. We have set up an eight-bed isolation ward at the port hospital in Taratala and a four-bed ward in Haldia. An SOP has been evolved to shift any Covid-19 suspect from a ship or any port premises to isolation wards. If need be, we can increase the number of beds in Kolkata to 30,” Kumar said. 

 Masters of vessels are sending details of crew —nationality, last port of call and health condition— to SPMPT. Only after the port health officer clears the details are the ships being allowed to berth in Kolkata, Haldia and Budge Budge. Even then, medical teams screen the crew.
