Covid-19: Confusion over names leads to discharge of 2 from quarantine
2020-04-25
BAREILLY: In a scary move that could have potentially led to more people coming in contact with Covid-19 positive cases, the health department in Moradabad on Thursday evening mistakenly discharged two Covid-19 patients from a quarantine centre as their names were similar to two other persons, who tested negative, in the same ward. 


On Friday, after realising their mistake, a medical team brought the two individuals back to the quarantine centre. 

Meanwhile, district magistrate RK Singh said that no action was initiated against the doctors as the incident was a “human error that was timely rectified.” 

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr MC Garg said, “It was indeed a mistake, and an enquiry headed by the additional director of health has been set up. Appropriate action would be taken after the enquiry report comes.”
