Kochi: Critic and author M K Sanoo took up a new role on Tuesday as a ‘grandfather on call’ fielding questions from young children, who are now confined to their homes without the usual summer holiday fun. 

Though the ‘phone-in programme’ was set to begin on Monday it did not take off since the landline went out of order. 

“Today I got calls from around 10 to 12 children. They were mostly in the age group of six to 12 and had curious questions on several topics,” said the nonagenarian critic, an indispensable face in the city’s literary events. 

“One kid wanted to know about ‘rakshasas’ and whether they were real. I told him that they are purely products of narrative imagination and meant to represent inner feelings of humans. A 14-year-old wanted to know what he should do to get into Indian Administrative Service. I told him to study well and keep the aim and attend the coaching classes,” said Sanoo.

Some others approached him with doubts in the literary field. “An eighth standard student wanted to know whether one can write poetry in prose or should it be written in verse alone. Another one wanted to know what exactly is human relation,” said Sanoo. 

Children in the age group of six to 15 who would like to listen to some gentle wisdom can call up his landline 0484-2353433 between 10am and 11am.
