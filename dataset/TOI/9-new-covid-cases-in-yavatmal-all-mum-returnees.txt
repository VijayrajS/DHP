2020-05-21
Yavatmal: The possibility of the district coming out of red zone on Friday has dimmed after nine new Covid-19 cases were reported on Wednesday, taking the number of active positive cases in Yavatmal to 16.

According to sources, the new cases have been reported from Digras (4) (Isapur 3 and Rui Talav 1), Pusad (4) and Malkini village in Mahagaon (1). 

All those tested positive are Mumbai returnees. All these persons had travelled together from Vasai in Palghar district near Mumbai in a Matador. Two of them, from Hudi village in Pusad tehsil, had already tested positive and are in the isolation ward of GMCH.

Of the 17 swab samples taken from the high risk contacts, nine (seven males and two females) have tested Covid positive while six came negative and two reports are awaited.

Meanwhile, reports of the 52-year-old man from Hudi village, stamped Home Quarantined in Ahmednagar two weeks ago, who died on road while returning from Pusad hospital came negative for Covid infection. The man was reported to be suffering from cough, fever and breathing difficulties.

The man along with his wife had returned from Ahmednagar two weeks ago. However, they were forced to stay in a farm as local police patil allegedly prevented them from entering the village.

The manâ€™s death, however, raises question as to how home quarantined persons were allowed to move on their own without any monitoring by the authorities.

Residents are in a panic now after detection of coronavirus patients in their villages. Moreover, those who returned from Mumbai and other places are seen flouting the home quarantine rules and often move in the villages.
