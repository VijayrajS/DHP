Covid-19: Pune Cantt under strict lockdown this weekend
2020-05-09
PUNE: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has announced a two-day complete lockdown of the entire cantonment area, starting Saturday. 


Only pharmacies and petrol pumps will be allowed to remain open during this period. The move comes as cases of Covid-19 have surged considerably over the last few days in parts of the cantonment.

“The two-day lockdown will be observed on May 9 and 10. I agree that there will be some difficulties for residents, but this is necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus,” PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar told TOI. 

He added that while district authorities have already issued lockdown orders in containment zones, the two-day lockdown is to make people aware of the gravity of the situation.

Kumar also added that a particular point of concern are areas adjacent to Bhavani Peth such as New Modikhana and Bhimpura, where families live in congested spaces.

“The virus spread in those areas because they are right next to Bhavani Peth. In ten days, the number of cases in the cantonment area has surged to 58. People in these areas live in tight spaces, with large families living in a single room. In the New Modikhana area, we found a number of Covid-19 cases and it turned out that they used the same toilet. Despite the situation here, people continue to move about so the local elected members requested this step,” Kumar said.
