2020-04-17
Chennai: The DMK and its allies on Thursday demanded that the government provide Rs 1 crore each as relief to the families of every person who died of Covid-19 infection in the state.

The opposition parties also demanded that the government increase the financial aid to family ration card holders from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 as lockdown had wrecked their finances. DMK president M K Stalin had convened the meeting through video conference to discuss the situation in the state after the outbreak of Covid-19. Sources said 11 leaders participated in the meeting.

So far, 15 people have died in TN because of Covid-19 outbreak, as per official figures.

The parties demanded extra wages and hike in salary for front-line government staff engaged in fighting the pandemic. Any further delay in procuring protective gear, testing kits and other equipment would lead to catastrophic effects, the leaders said.

“The Madras high court has ordered that there is no bar on parties and NGOs providing relief directly to the affected people. The court said those interested in distributing relief should seek permission from local officials 48 hours in advance. But the state government is bent on blocking us from distributing relief material,” said Stalin.

The meeting said lockdown should not put human lives at risk. It wanted the Centre and state government to come out with workable strategies during lockdown.

When police have no problem in deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and law minister C Ve Shanmugham holding meetings in secretariat and at Villupuram respectively, why do they have problems in opposition leaders holding a meeting, asked Stalin.
