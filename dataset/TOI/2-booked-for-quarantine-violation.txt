KOCHI: Ernakulam rural police on Friday booked two for violating home quarantine and transferred them to institutional quarantine. Police said that one of them even opened his shop soon after returning from Tamil Nadu. The cases were registered at Kalady and Kothamangalam police stations.

At Kalady, a youth who resides at Sreemoolanagaram was found loitering around in the town within days after returning from Tamil Nadu. Police said that the man had crossed the Kumily checkpost and reached the state on May 19. He was spotted by residents who alerted the police. Police booked him under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance.

In the second incident from Kothamangalam, a Pollachi native who runs a shop at Kothamangalam opened his shop on Friday. The man had returned from Tamil Nadu two days ago and was instructed to remain at home. Police were again tipped off by residents. He too was booked under the ordinance and was moved to institutional quarantine.

Rural SP K Karthick said that the violators would face stringent action. “It is a time when several people are returning to the state from other states. These people should strictly follow the conditions of home quarantine. Everyone should maintain vigil. Inform the authorities as soon as you notice a violation,” said the SP.

Ernakulam rural police said that 3588 are in home quarantine under their jurisdiction alone. “There are 434 in institutional quarantine. Person to person check is being held. However, with more people going into quarantine by the day, the returnees must show some social responsibility and follow home quarantine. By violating this restriction, the offender is risking the lives of so many people,” said a police official.

Rural police said that Happy at Home, an application developed for tracking the well being of those in home quarantine, is also being used to ensure that persons in quarantine are safe.
