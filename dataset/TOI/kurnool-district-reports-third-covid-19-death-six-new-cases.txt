TIRUPATI: Kurnool district reported its third Covid-19 death and six new cases on Saturday, taking the number of cases in the district to 132, the highest in the state.


Sources in the district administration said a 60-year-old Covid-19 patient, a resident of Budhavaripeta in Kurnool, died owing to complications caused by comorbidities. The patient died while being shifted from Viswabharathi Covid-19 hospital to the government general hospital in Kurnool on Saturday.

After the death was reported, disrict collector G Veerapandian appointed an expert committee of doctors to analyse the medical condition of all Covid-19 patients at levels 1 and 2 Covid hospitals in the district and make arrangements to shift them to the state Covid-19 hospital at Sri Padmavathi Medical College in Tirupati, if needed.

The collector said the administration has initiated measures to conduct rapid tests across the district from Saturday.

“Everyday 300 samples will be tested at the government hospitals at Kurnool, Nandyal, Banaganapalle and Adoni. People should not approach the government hospitals to get their tests done but the medical officers at the ground level will be the ones who will refer the suspected patients to the respective hospitals for Covid-19 medical screening,” said the collector.

Kurnool range DIG P Venkatarami Reddy and SP Kaginelli Fakeerappa inspected lockdown measures across the district on Saturday.
