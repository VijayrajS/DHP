No mandatory quarantine for Bihar migrants
2020-06-03
PATNA: Migrant workers returning to Bihar will not have to undergo the mandatory 14-day institutional quarantine any more, as the movement of people has opened across the country, a state government official said on Tuesday, a move that can lead to further spurt in Covid-19 cases.



The registration of migrants for the purpose of quarantine closed on Monday, the official of the Disaster Management department said.

More than 8.77 lakh people have been discharged from quarantine centres after completing the 14-day quarantine period. Besides, 5.30 lakh migrants are still lodged in block and district level quarantine centres in Bihar.

“We have stopped the registration of migrants from Monday for putting them in 14-day institutional quarantine... Why will anyone (migrant) be registered and for what when restrictions on the movement of people have been lifted in the country.”

He, however, asserted that door-to-door health monitoring will continue.
