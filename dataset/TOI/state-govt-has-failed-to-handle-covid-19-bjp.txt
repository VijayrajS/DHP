2020-05-20
NASHIK: A memorandum was submitted to district collector Suraj Mandhare on Tuesday by members of city and district units of BJP, stating that the state government has failed in handling the Covid-19 crisis in Maharashtra.

The state has so far reported the maximum cases and deaths related to Covid-19 across the country. The city and district units of BJP said that the Centre has issued certain guidelines in preventing the spread of coronavirus. “However, the state government has failed to implement the guidelines effectively. The same could have been done by ensuring there were sufficient availability of PPE kits, setting up hospitals and bringing people from all strata of the society towards combating Covid-19,” the memorandum said.

It added that the state government should make it public where the money released by the Centre to combat Covid-19 has been spent.
