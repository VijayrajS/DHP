Vadodara: A coronavirus patient from Padra taluka of Vadodara district and six relatives of his were booked at Vadu police station for flouting lockdown norms and travelling to their native place from Surat.

According to police, Thakor Gohil, the patient, and two relatives – Sanjay Gohil and Ranjit Gohil – had returned to Chokari, their native place, from Udhna GIDC in Surat on March 31 during lockdown. Their travel activity was revealed when Thakor tested positive on Thursday and the other revealed about their travel movements to health officials. Thakor has been admitted at SSG Hospital’s isolation ward for treatment.

Four other relatives of Thakor – Pradeep Gohil, Hemangi Gohil, Bhailal Gohil and Manjula Gohil – were booked in a separate offence. Police said that the four persons are natives of Chokari but are settled in Bhathena of Surat for several years. On Wednesday, they travelled to Chokari from Surat when they learnt that Thakor was unwell and his samples had been collected for coronavirus test.

“On Thursday, health department officials informed that four of Thakor’s relatives had arrived from Surat on Wednesday. This is not allowed as they may spread the virus through their travel movement. So, we have registered a separate FIR against them and their samples too have been collected for tests,” said a police official.
