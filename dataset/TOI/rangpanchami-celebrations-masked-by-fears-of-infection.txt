2020-03-15
INDORE: Indoreans’ festive spirit remained high despite district administration cancelling Gair to check spread of coronavirus as they thronged Rajwada Square in thousands and celebrated Rangpanchami with both dry and wet colours. The once-in-a-year event however failed to record the usual turnout of 1.5 lakh as many people preferred avoiding crowded place. Ahead of the event, district administration had made elaborate arrangements but had to cancel Gair at the 11th hour based on recommendations from Centre and state in view of coronavirus scare.

Though organizers of Gair followed the orders in public interest, enthusiastic people could not resist themselves from visiting Rajwada Square, which is the epicentre of the event. People, especially youngsters, were seen celebrating the occasion by throwing dry and wet colours at each other and dancing on the beat of dhol brought by them.

To control the crowd and manage traffic, police had banned entry of vehicles in Rajwada. Besides, police checkpoints were placed at all squares and feeder roads to check hooliganism on Rangpanchami.

“Almost all officials were on field and were deployed at different pickets across city. The administration set up different teams comprising senior officials to maintain law and order during celebrations. The police coordinated with administration to keep a close vigil on activities of revellers and averted any untoward situation,” DIG Ruchi Vardhan Mishra said. She added that teams were assigned responsibilities to remain on spots and check if people were misbehaving or creating ruckus. District administration has cancelled previously issued permissions of programmes, gathering and public-events.
