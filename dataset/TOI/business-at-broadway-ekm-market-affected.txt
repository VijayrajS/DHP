2020-03-12
KOCHI: The Covid-19 fear among the public is taking its toll on the city’s commercial sector too, as Broadway and Ernakulam Market, which are the prime commercial hubs, are witnessing a huge drop in sales. Merchants and traders said that people are unwilling to come to public places and the sales of goods have dropped to nearly half of the usual sales. Many of the shops that sell stationery goods, grocery, vegetables, bakery items, fish and meat, spices, textiles, etc. reported only 50% of usual sales on Wednesday. Shopkeepers said that the situation was worse on Sunday which usually witnesses brisk sales.


“The sales are too dim and the vegetables are decaying due to low demand. We are now selling most items at half the price to clear the stock but still there are not enough customers. No new stocks are being taken as we will have shut down if the situation worsens,” said Ramesh Kumar, a veggie-seller.

As the businesses in restaurant and catering sector too are witnessing a dip due to cancellation of public functions, the number of bulk orders to purchase confectionaries, vegetables, fish and meat has reduced.

“Celebration at weddings, housewarmings and other functions are either scaled down or cancelled and these lead to decline in bulk orders. Usually, we have a sale up to four boxes of samosas in the morning itself but today not even one box was sold. The sale of chips too has declined and we have reduced the production,” said Pratheesh Vakayal, who works with a bake house.

“There were only two customers since morning and there was no wholesale purchase today. Broadway street and footpaths were less crowded even during peak hours,” said Zulfikar Ali, a wholesale textile dealer in Cloth Bazaar.
