The infected constable has been shifted to SNMC's isolation facility, while his eight colleagues have been quarantined.

Senior commandant RPF Agra division, Prakash Kumar Panda, said, “The constable was found ill with fever on Monday, after which his sample was collected. On Tuesday, his sample was tested positive. I had a video call with the patient. He is responding well and will recover soon.”

“Also, all those in close touch with the person have been quarantined, especially the cops of RPF barrack, where the corona patient was putting up after duty,” the senior commandant said on Wednesday.

“Till now, we don’t know from where the cop got infected, as he along with other RPF cops have not left railway station duty for the past two months. It is quite possible that he may have caught the infection while on Shramik Special duty for migrant workers,” he added.
