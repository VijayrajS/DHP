JHANSI: In city’s first case, 59-year-old woman was reported coronavirus positive on Monday. She resides in the congested and thickly populated Orcha Gate area in the old city. 


While the woman has been admitted to Jhansi Medical College, her entire family has been put into isolation. Apart from this, samples of 27 persons including three doctors whom she had contacted recently have been sent for testing. 

The news has come as a blow for the locals as the city had no case till now and the administration had kept a tight vigil throughout the lockdown period.

The infected woman, who has no travel history, was ill for the past few days and was getting herself treated by private doctors. When after showing three different doctors, she did not get any relief, she got admitted in medical college on Saturday. Here after seeing her symptoms, her sample was tested for COVID-19 which came positive on Monday. She has no recent travel history and as a result doctors are finding it difficult to trace the contacts.

The administration has sealed the entire area asking everyone to stay inside. Twelve medical teams have been constituted to screen every person of 300 houses in the locality. On the other hand the husband of the woman along with their daughter, son, son-in -law and grandson has been put in isolation.

DM Jhansi Andra Vamsi said, “The entire area has been sealed and we are getting medical screening done of each and every person in the locality. Those who will be found suspected, will be tested for coronavirus. As of now, no travel history of the woman has come up.”
