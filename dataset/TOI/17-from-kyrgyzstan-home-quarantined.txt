PATNA: The state health department on Tuesday collected samples of 17 Kyrgyzstan nationals, who were spotted at a mosque in Digha locality of Patna recently, and sent them for test. The move was necessitated following rise in number of Covid-19 cases in the country after Tablighi Jamaat, a religious congregation which was held at Nizamuddin markaz (centre) in New Delhi. 


Patna district epidemiologist Prashant Kumar said the 17 Kyrgyzstan nationals were screened earlier and found asymptomatic. “We have taken the sample for final confirmation,” Kumar added.

These foreigners, who were on a religious tour, had been staying in two mosques in Kurji and Phulwarishrif. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said they were staying in two different groups in two mosques. He said locals got apprehensive after spotting them and informed the police.

Sharma said 10 Kyrgyzstan nationals were staying in Kurji mosque and seven in Phulwarisharif mosque. He said they were taken to AIIMS-Patna on March 23 and screened. “They are here on tourist visa and with valid passport. For precaution, they have been home quarantined. One group is staying at a mosque in Phulwarisharif and another group in a flat at Samanpura. Local police stations have kept their passports so that they do not move during the quarantine period,” Sharma said.
