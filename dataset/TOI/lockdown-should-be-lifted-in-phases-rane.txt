Lockdown should be lifted in phases: Rane
2020-04-08
Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the lockdown should be lifted in a phased manner to avoid any kind of community transmission. “Lifting of lockdown in entirety can lead to community transmission due to heavy movement of people,” he told TOI on Tuesday.

“I have written to the CM that even if the lockdown is lifted, movement of people should be restricted. Section 144 must be in place for next three-four months,” he said.

“I strongly believe that there should not be continuous curfew but there should be curbs on movement of people and social distancing should be strongly adhered to,” he said. He also said mass gatherings and religious functions should not be allowed for the next six months. 

He also said that the Epidemic Diseases Act should continue to be in force till the situation is in complete control.

“I’m in no mood to lift the Epidemic Act. In Goa, we are lucky that there is no community transmission. We have tackled it with stringent measures, but if we slip at this stage, Goa will not be in a position to handle the situation,” he said.

Rane said though Goa being a small state was in a better position than rest of the states, the next six months would be a “challenge”.

“I don’t see anything happening for the next six to seven months. Tourism definitely will take a beating. I have been analysing the situation. People are scared to travel,” Rane said.

“Social distancing will become a new way of life in this country and world as well,” he said.

Rane, who is also the industries minister, said the focus should be on finding long-term solutions to revive the industries. “The Covid-19 is a challenge which we are all facing today,” he said.
