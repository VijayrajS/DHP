Covid-19: Testing slows down, but case burden soars in PCMC limits
2020-06-07
PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: From 265 Covid-19 cases on May 22 to over 600 positive patients on June 5, the coronavirus spread in the 181sqkm Pimpri Cinchwad municipal limits has worsened, especially since the lockdown exit began in the twin cities, despite reduced testing.

 


The Pimpri Chinchwad municipal area was the first to come out of the red zone in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), with the process of relaxation starting early on May 22 here as against the other areas. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) also started its skeletal service in Pimpri Chinchwad first.

As per the data provided by the health department, the first Covid-19 case in PCMC limits was recorded on March 11 and the tally rose to 12 by the end of the month. The further rise, albeit gradual, was recorded in April, when the total case tally rose to 113. It was in May that the case showed a spike, taking the total count to 522. In May as well, the sudden rise was registered after May 22 when the total case count was 265.

Besides, records show that Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has frozen its testing to just an average of 115 tests daily over the last 10 days. When asked about the rationale behind the move, PCMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar told TOI, “Earlier, we were testing 20 people for each positive patient. It has come down in recent times as the testing infrastructure is not adequate. We are now setting up a testing facility in Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) Hospital and also tying up with more private laboratories. This should help in more testing.”

According to experts, early detection and increased testing are key to arrest coronavirus spread. So far, the PCMC has tested about 306 persons per lakh of its population compared to neighbouring Pune Municipal Corporation’s 1,107.

On the faster doubling of cases, Hardikar said, “It is also because the denominator was low in PCMC limits some 10 days ago. Besides, most of the cases in the civic limits are coming from just one area.”

The Anandnagar slum pocket in the civic limits has contributed to over 220 of the 679 cases.
