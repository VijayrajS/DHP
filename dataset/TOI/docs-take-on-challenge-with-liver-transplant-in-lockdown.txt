Pune doctors take on challenge with liver transplant in lockdown
2020-05-16
PUNE: Under extreme infection control measures, a team of doctors carried out a cadaver liver transplant at Sahyadri Hospital on May 15, the first vital organ transplant during the lockdown.


A 49-year-old farmer from Ahmednagar met with an accident and was moved to Ruby Hall Clinic on May 12 where he was declared brain dead. His family donated his liver which was transplanted into a 62-year-old Pune woman with end-stage liver disease at Sahyadri Hospital

"At a time when the organ transplantation programme has come to a halt because of rising Covid-19 cases, the liver transplant is hope for patients suffering from chronic illnesses owing to organ failure," transplant coordinator Aarti Gokhle of Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) told TOI.

Infection-related rules are stringent during this time. A donor should not have any infection. Also, it is not easy to get the recipient, because many are not willing to undergo surgery during active virus transmission.

“When we were sure that we can undertake organ donation and transplant, we approached the family of the brain dead patient for their consent,” neurosugeon Kapil Zirpe of Ruby Hall Clinic said.

Sahyadri hospital's transplant surgeon Bipin Vibhute said the surgery took longer since movement took time because of the PPE kit. “We tried to keep minimum staff in the operation room. The patient is stable and doing well," he said.
