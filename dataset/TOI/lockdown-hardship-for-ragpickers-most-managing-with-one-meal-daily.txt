Lockdown hardship for ragpickers in Kota, most managing with one meal daily
2020-04-21
KOTA: The lockdown has caused great hardships for ragpickers. Nearly 74 such people from at least 17 families in Kota, who were involved in ragpicking in usual times, are now out of work and barely manage to get one-square meal a day.


The strict enforcement of lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic has left 102 infected and three dead in Kota city so far. The ragpickers’ fate has been no different than that of other daily wage labourers, who have been confined to their rented accommodations near Murgi Farm in Nanta area of the city, without enough ration or food. 

“We are hardly able to manage food for one time for the family for the last 15 days, with the ration that we somehow could put aside during the usual times,” Sunita Maratha, a ragpicker and mother of four said. While narrating her plight, she said that they haven’t been able to go out to pick up rags due to the lockdown, and if at all, it’s barely available in such times. Also, the kabaadi (scrap) shops, from where they could arrange rags or scrap material, are closed these days, she said, claiming that voluntary organizations or officials of district administration have not reached them for distribution of free ration and food. 

“In usual times, we would make Rs 100–150 daily by selling rags and waste picked up from the roadsides at the kabaadi shop, but now, we are not able to earn even a single paisa due to the lockdown,” she claimed. 

“For the first 10-12 days during the first phrase of lockdown, the volunteers of social organizations distributed food packets among the ragpicker families but later, they stopped coming to the locality,” claimed Deepak Maratha (34), another rag picker from the city. Ironically, Kota district administration has issued eight helpline numbers for the people in need for food and emergency services.
