Nashik: The state’s free ambulance service has picked up over 300 people, who showed symptoms of Covid-19 and has to be taken to hospitals for check-up in less than a month.

The ambulances, which are operated through a public private partnership, can be availed by dialing 108. Nearly 25% of the ambulances have been dedicated to transporting Covid-19 patients or those with symptoms. The patients are either picked up from screening centres or from communities.

The doctors and the drivers on these ambulances have been given complete training about taking precautionary measures and the method of sanitizing the ambulance after every patient is dropped to the hospital.

Ashwin Raghamvar, district manager of the Bharat Vikas Group (BVG) that operates the Dial 108 ambulances, said, “Soon after the outbreak, it was decided to dedicate 25% of the fleet for ferrying patients with Covid-19 or those with symptoms.”

He said that of their fleet of 46 ambulances, 11 have been put into dedicated service of the Covid-19 cases. “Since the last week of March, we have ferried 314 people from screening centres or communities through these ambulances,” Raghamwar added.

The drivers, who are called as pilots, and doctors in the ambulances have been trained of sanitizing the ambulance properly after ferrying every patient. They have also been provided with personal protection equipment kits.

The other 35 ambulances continue to be stationed in different parts of the district to rush regular patients to hospitals.

The doctors said that there was no drop in the other patients, who were rushed to the hospitals, though the number of road accidents has gone down. The 35 ambulances have been deployed all over the district to ensure that no person in medical emergency has to face problem due to the unavailability of ambulances.
