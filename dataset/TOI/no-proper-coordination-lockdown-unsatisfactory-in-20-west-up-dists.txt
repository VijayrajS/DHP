No proper coordination, lockdown unsatisfactory’ in 20 west UP dists
2020-04-20
Agra: The UP government has termed the "status of lockdown" in 20 districts of west Uttar Pradesh, including Agra, which has witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases, as “unsatisfactory”, mainly, due to local administration’s failure to enforce it strictly. 

However, the lockdown situation in six districts - Aligarh, Etah, Hathras, Kasganj, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur - has been described as “satisfactory”, as only two or three cases have been reported from there so far. 

The report, prepared by additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi, on the basis of different parameters, including the number of Covid-19 cases, attacks on police and medical staff, implementation of lockdown conditions and other medical facilities, mentioned reasons for the poor performance by districts. 

According to officials, the number of Coronavirus patients and Jamaatis have increased during the lockdown period in 20 districts, which shows that the lockdown rules are not being followed. 

The ACS has sent the report to all the district authorities and directed them to improve functioning to check the transmission of the disease and follow lockdown protocols.

The report stated that in Agra lack of coordination was witnessed even between the principal and doctors of the medical college. Thereafter, action was taken by the government and a professor and head of medicine department was suspended while a departmental inquiry has been initiated against the head of paediatric department for the same. 

“Lack of coordination also exists between police and administration in districts of Ghaziabad, Meerut and Gautam Budh Nagar,” the report stated. 

Till now, 241 Covid-19 positive cases have been reported in Agra, which is the highest in the state, followed by other districts of west UP such as Gautam Budh Nagar (95), Saharanpur (91), Meerut (75) and Moradabad (55).
