2020-04-10
KOLKATA: The state has formed a nine-member data analysis cell to collect data to help pick out hotspots for Covid-19 infection. Once such hotspots are identified, the cell will advise the government on the likely areas that would require random testing.


“Expanding data gathering and analysis is going to be helpful in testing and more meaningful isolation. We have to make at attempt at identifying the silent carriers,” said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar of Medica Superspecialty Hospital.

The cell will collect data from multiple sources, including districts, on a real-time basis. It will then detect patterns and undercurrents, in addition to determining the hotspots of the infection.

“The data will identify the high-density zones and help the administration in decide which areas need complete lockdown. This will also help increase the number of tests and detect where they are most needed,” said surgical oncologist Diptendra Sarkar of SSKM Hospital.

The government has already launched an app for Asha workers, named Sandhane, to get data on fever and cough from the grassroots. Asha workers will collect this information during household surveys. “The data will directly come to the Nabanna server,” said state chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha.

Meanwhile, Liver Foundation West Bengal and Raxa have developed a self-reporting app, called Covid-19 Containment Pathway, through which people can report if they have symptoms or travel history. The information will go directly to the server at Swasthya Bhawan where officials will identify people at risk at take up measures accordingly. Launched three days ago, close to 200 individuals have already reported through this app.
