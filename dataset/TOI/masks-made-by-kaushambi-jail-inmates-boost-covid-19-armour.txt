Prayagraj: Doing their bit in the country’s fight against novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, inmates of Kaushambi district jail are busy making face masks out of cloth and have managed to produce 18,000 units since starting the initiative in March-end.

These masks have been distributed in nagar panchayats, chief development officer’s office, chief medical officer’s office, power distribution unit, district magistrate’s camp office, toll plazas, old age homes and hospitals.

Superintendent of Kaushambi district jail BS Mukund said that the face masks manufactured by these inmates have been distributed among other prisoners and prison staff as well. “A group of 10 inmates is still working overtime to make these face masks. While seven of the inmates cut the cloth and layer it with tissue, the other three sew the masks. They started making these masks in March-end and have manufactured over 18,000 masks till date. The first 2,000 pieces made were distributed among other prisoners and our own staff and rest were sent to other departments,” he added. Most policemen posted at various police stations of Kaushambi and Reserve Police Lines are wearing face masks made these inmates.

Talking about how the jail administration idea got the idea, Mukund said, “In our case, necessity was the mother of invention. While we were worried about how soon we could procure masks for our jail, some of the inmates suggested that they get together to make face masks inside the prison premises. The group of 10 inmates, who were taking vocational training, volunteered for the job,” the jail superintendent said.
