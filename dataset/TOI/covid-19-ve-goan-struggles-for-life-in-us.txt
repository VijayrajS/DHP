QUEPEM: The condition of the seafarer from Salcete who is suffering from Covid-19 and is admitted in a hospital in United States has worsened, according to family sources. The seafarer’s family got in touch with the Broward Health Medical Center, Miami, Florida on Tuesday and were shocked to learn of the condition.

“The last time my brother spoke to me was on April 2. We are very worried. All our relatives and friends are praying to God to cure him and bring him back to us safely,” his sister told TOI on Tuesday.

The seafarer is understood to have contracted coronavirus while he was on board a cruise-liner and was admitted to a hospital in Miami on April 1. He has since needed to be put on a ventilator.

The 42-year-old is among the 14 Indian seafarers from the same cruise-liner who tested positive and are now admitted to various hospitals in Miami.

Doctors from the Broward health center have informed the family that the seafarer is not responding and is now unable to speak. 

The seafarer was found to be Covid-19 positive a fortnight ago and kept in isolation at the ship's hospital. He was shifted to an onshore hospital on March 27 after his condition worsened.

He had embarked on the voyage in January on the ‘Oasis of the Sea’ cruise-liner, operated by Royal Caribbean Lines (RCL), .
