However, police are doubting this to be the case, as there has been no inmate who is suspected of being afflicted with the virus so far. Moreover, new inmates are being kept apart from those already in jail.”The ACP added that the police suspect the accused had escaped as they were recently lodged in Chakki. “Moreover, they had earlier too escaped from jail,” he said. The police were also trying to trace the other accused.Suraj was arrested by the police on Monday evening from Dholewal.
