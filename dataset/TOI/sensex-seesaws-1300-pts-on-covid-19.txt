2020-03-03
MUMBAI: The stock market witnessed extreme volatility on Monday with the sensex swinging nearly 1,300 points intraday before closing 153 points lower at close of trade. The rupee too came under pressure, closing 55 paise lower at 72.73 after two new cases of coronavirus came to light in India during market hours.


The sensex rallied 786 points at first as most of the Asian markets opened in the green on anticipation of a coordinated easing by central banks worldwide. However, as more cases of the virus got reported globally, European markets opened weak.


 

Closing down for the seventh consecutive session, the sensex ended at 38,144, dragged down by bank stocks, metals and FMCG. Top losers were SBI, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, ONGC and IndusInd bank. The broader Nifty of the NSE also shed more than 400 points from its day’s high and closed lower by 69 points, or 0.62%, at 11,133.

In the forex market, the rupee reversed its initial gains to settle sharply down at 72.73 against the dollar on fears of foreign funds exiting the market. While foreign institutional investors were net sellers of stocks worth Rs 1,354 crore, Indian institutional investors bought Rs 1,138 crore worth equities.

European stock markets too closed weak. Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.2%, while the CAC 40 in Paris declined 1.2%. Germany’s DAX did worse than its counterparts, falling 1.3% to 11,735. Tuesday’s opening will be influenced by the Asian markets. The US markets traded in the green with the Dow Jones index up 2.5% in early trade.

According to a report by Sanctum Wealth Management, the response to Covid-19 will naturally be a key determinant of the pace of growth recovery. “If an economy as large as China — 16% of global GDP — is at a near standstill for over a month, global growth is bound to be impacted although the extent of the disruption is hard to estimate,” the report said. Initial revisions have shaved 10-30 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) off global GDP growth for 2020, but one should expect more revisions to the number as more data flows, the report added.
