2020-04-12
Chandigarh: In its fight to contain the spread of coronavirus, the Punjab government has so far identified 647 vulnerable areas, including villages and residential colonies, in 16 districts across the state and sealed them as a precautionary measure.

The restrictions have been lifted in some areas after improvement in the situation there. Of the 647 areas as on April 10, as many as 599 locations in Ludhiana have been sealed, highest in the state. The district known as industrial hub of the state has recorded 10 positive cases and two deaths. Nawanshahr, second worst-hit district of the state with 19 positive cases, has 15 hot spots, followed by Ropar and Jalandhar where 12 areas each have been sealed.

In Mohali, district with highest number of positive cases with figure of 50, eight spots have been sealed, including Jawaharpur in Dera Bassi, which has accounted for 34 cases. This is the highest number of cases reported from one area in the state.

People residing in hot spots are not allowed to move out of their home for a fixed period of time. Till the time restrictions are in place, the local administration delivers all essential items, including food and medicine, at their doorstep. Medical teams screen the entire population residing in these areas and those showing symptoms of carrying the virus are tested. People tested positive are shifted to isolation wards. Disinfectants are sprayed in the sealed coronavirus hotspots.

Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, spokesperson of Punjab health department, said the list of hot spots was dynamic and changed daily. “New affected areas are included in the list, while areas from where no new cases are reported for a fixed period of time are removed from the list,” said Dr Bhaskar.

GEO FENCING

The Punjab government has done geo fencing of all the hot spots for keeping a track of movement of individuals through their mobile phone’s cell tower location. The teams keeping a watch get an alert the moment a person steps out of the house. Geo-fencing is accurate by up to 300metre. Dr Bhaskar said they daily get report of people who moved out of the sealed areas. The information is shared with respective deputy commissioners who issue warning to erring individuals. There are other states in the country which are using the same technology to track movement.

MASS TESTING

The Punjab government is going to increase testing in the hot spots and has urged the central government to speed up the supply of rapid testing kits. The state government has ordered 10 lakh such kits from Indian Council of Medical Research, while raising inquiry for another 10,000 in the open market. Capt Amarinder Singh has already issued directions to the health department to start community testing for severe acute respiratory illness in hotspots for Covid-19 cases.
