Coronavirus scare: Streets deserted, face masks fly off the shelves in Visakhapatnam
2020-03-20
VISAKHAPATNAM: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to hoarding of masks and respirators across the city despite health officials requesting citizens to not purchase them, or at least not hoard. Citizens on the other hand have been feeling a financial pinch as masks are being sold at higher prices to exploit the rising demand.


P Ramadevi, a resident of Gajuwaka said that the boom in demand for masks has made sellers jack-up prices. She said that she had visited 14 shops to purchase masks for her son who is slated to go back to Australia. 

Meanwhile, a railway official of the Waltair division of East Coast Railway (ECoR) said that having failed to procure masks for the open market, the department made 20,000 masks which were distributed to their staff on Thursday. 

Ravi Kumar, Vizianagaram zone executive director of AP public transport department said that the department has ordered masks in bulk to distribute among staff, particularly the 23,000 conductors. 

Meanwhile, Dr PV Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College (AMC) said that healthy people do not need to wear masks and health experts have not come up with such a suggestion. Dr Sudhakar said that only those suffering from fever, cold or cough should wear masks and those using masks should not touch the masks with their hands.

The city, on Thursday, wore a deserted look with educational institutions, malls, theatres, temples and parks closed down.

Visakhapatnam MP MVV Satyanarayana said, “The state government is taking all possible steps like provisioning thermal scanners in crowded areas. Social distancing is essential to check the spread of the virus.”
