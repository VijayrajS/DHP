Covid-19: Competitive exam coaching in Ahmedabad goes online
2020-03-18
AHMEDABAD: After the state health department announced shutdown of educational institutions, coaching classes and even cinema halls and swimming pools, students taking competitive exams and their parents were left concerned over their studies. However, a number of coaching classes across Ahmedabad have begun taking mock tests online and making study modules available online.


“We have made video lectures available and the syllabus is on track. Even the mock tests we conduct have been taken on the online platform and WhatsApp groups have been created for students to discuss any difficulties they face or even to monitor their syllabus,” said Tushar Parekh, vice-president of a city-based coaching centre for National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)

“Students are also free to call up teachers as all the classes have been suspended,” he added.

Some of the centres are even conducting live lectures. “After shutting classes, we have begun with telecasting all the lectures live which students can access with user IDs and password. We also upload the solutions online and if there is any confusion among students, they can always approach the faculty over the phone,” said the manager of another coaching class.

Rakesh Bothra, owner of a city-based coaching centre, said, “We have strictly shut the classes and asked students not to come in the interest of public health. The preparations and modules will be conducted online with virtual classes running. The batches for class 11 will begin after April, based on situation.”
