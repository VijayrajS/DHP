Lockdown heroes: Serving hot meals to starving stomachs
2020-04-18
HYDERABAD: Looking at homeless people going without food during lockdown, a man decided to put his learning to use to help the needy. T Vinay Kumar, a diploma holder in hotel management, has been cooking and serving it warm and hot to the homeless in different areas of the city, including Nampally, Bowenpally, Manikonda and other places. 

Vinay begins cooking near NMDC, Masab Tank, around 2 pm and completes the cooking within a few hours. At around 7pm, he puts the food in his car and drives around serving the hot meal to those who he finds hungry on the road.

“I am moved to tears when children come running for food,” Vinay told TOI. After his graduation, Vinay did a two-year diploma course in hotel management but ventured into a different area of working. He worked as a manager in a bank in Dubai for a few years and returned to India to set up his own recruitment agency. 

The lockdown brought back the cooking skills in him, which he learnt 15 years ago, as he saw people starving on the roads. A couple of volunteers joined him in the task of cutting vegetables. Another place he has noticed is the Gandhi Hospital area where many homeless people are found on the roads starving and waiting for food. A number of migrant labourers at Nampally, Khairatabad, Panjagutta, Ameerpet and Balkampet are being provided food by Vinay. 

Though he wants to serve hot meals to starving stomachs, some needy families have requested him for provisions, which he gives. “Since some are not sure where their next meal would come from, they request for food packets so they can have it the next morning. We are meeting that need too,” the 34-year-old, who stays in Old Bowenpally said.
