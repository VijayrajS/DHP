Farmers reeling under lockdown now demand crop loan write-off
2020-04-08
Trichy: Despite the state government taking various measures to safeguard the livelihood of the farming community following the outbreak of Covid-19, they have been unable to market their produce. Hence, farmers who raised banana, pulses and flowers have appealed to the state and Union governments to write off the crop loan availed from both cooperative and nationalized banks immediately.

The worst affected are those who raised summer paddy, pulses, vegetables, flowers and banana which were ready for harvest. “As they could not transport their produce to their regular market, they were forced to sell them to traders. Taking advantage of the situation, the traders were buying in hundreds of rupees and earning in thousands”, state organizer of the farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress Puliyur A Nagarajan said.

Farmers who have cultivated maize, groundnut in Perambalur and some parts of Trichy could not harvest them due to non-availability of labourers, he added. Writing off crop loans is the only step that the government should take to protect the livelihood of farmers, he further stated. According to the secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan,the state government was doing many things to ease the business of farmers. However, for the farmers who were not tech-savvy it was not easy to book a truck online.

Unlike others, vegetable and flower farmers cannot remain indoors as they have to dispose of their perishable produce. Now, they are unable to do it because of the lockdown, he added. “Government should have procured banana, vegetables and flower and sold them through Uzhavar Santhai to avert the loss incurred by farmers”, he opined. In these circumstances, the Centre should at least announce Rs 3,000 as MSP for paddy.
