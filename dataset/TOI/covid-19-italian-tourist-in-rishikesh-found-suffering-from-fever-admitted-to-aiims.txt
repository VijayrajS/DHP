Dehradun: The owner of a guest house in Rishikesh on Sunday informed police about an Italian woman tourist who had not come out of her room since Holi. Soon after, a police team along with health department officials reached the hotel and checked on the 34-year-old woman, who was found to be suffering from throat infection and fever. The woman was admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh by police officials where she is being checked for coronavirus infection.

“The guest house owner called us after noticing that the woman hadn’t stepped out of her room since Holi. She had been taking pills on her own for the past few days as she didn’t want to see any health provider,” said Kanhaiya Lal Singh, a local intelligence unit (LIU) official.

Health officials told TOI that the woman was suffering from flu-like symptoms since her arrival in India but the infection became severe after she played Holi. They fear that if the woman is tested coronavirus-positive, then all those with whom she had played Holi would be at risk.

“She told us that she had been suffering from sore throat and fever since her first day in India. But she never visited a medical facility. Her condition worsened after Holi and on Sunday, she complained of breathing issues as well. She has now been admitted in AIIMS Rishikesh,” said Dr Rajeev Kumar, in-charge of Government Allopathy Centre, Rishikesh.

Meanwhile, the guest house owner told TOI that the woman had been staying in his facility since February 29. She had come to India on a one-month visa to learn yoga in Rishikesh.
