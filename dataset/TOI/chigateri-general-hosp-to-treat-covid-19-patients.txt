Chigateri General Hosp to treat Covid-19 patients
2020-05-11
Davanagere: The Chigateri General Hospital (CG hospital) in Davanagere has been converted into a full-fledged Covid-19 hospital, due to a rise in patients, said deputy commissioner Mahantesh Bilagi, at a press conference on Sunday. The total Covid-19 cases rose to 68, including a patient that tested positive in Davanagere on Sunday, said the DC. We have kept the 40-bed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and gynaecology ward attached to the CG Hospital main building insulated, by putting a strong barrier with separate entries, from the Covid-19 hospital, as many rural women and children visit these units, the DC said. “We have designated Bapuji hospital as a general hospital for medical care, apart from Covid-19 cases. People can get treated under government schemes in private nursing homes and hospitals in Davangere city,” the DC said. “All local lodges, including Rathan lodge, Abhiman lodge and Trishul lodge were cleaned up and disinfected on Sunday, to quarantine patients suspected to have Covid-19,” the DC said.
