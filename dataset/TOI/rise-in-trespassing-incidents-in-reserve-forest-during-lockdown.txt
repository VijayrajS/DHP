2020-04-03
Trichy: The forest department in Trichy region has recorded a rise in incidents of trespassing in reserve forest areas in the last few days. In most cases it was to collect firewood, but there have been attempts to poach as well.“As the lockdown has been testing the patience of people sitting idle at home, those living in villages close to forest areas have been venturing into the forest to kill time,” said forest officials. Such attempts have been found mostly in Thuvarankurichi and Manapparai forest ranges within Trichy. Except for Patchamalai, there aren’t much dense or evergreen forest in Trichy division. The increase in the mercury level over the last few weeks has made the availability of dry wood in abundance. “We have come across incidents of people living close to forest venturing into it for firewood. Such attempts have been taken seriously and even penalty has been imposed in a few incidents apart from letting them off with warnings,” said Trichy district forest officer D Sujatha. The forest department has also been working like the other departments as part of essential services. She said forest staffers are conducting awareness drives in villages about forest fires.
