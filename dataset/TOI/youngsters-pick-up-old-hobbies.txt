Youngsters in Patna pick up old hobbies amid lockdown
2020-03-26
PATNA: With fewer options left for socializing due to the closure of educational institutions and work from home facilities owing to Covid-19, people are spending more time with their families under the same roof.

Aprajita Singh (21), who is pursuing BBA in a Pune-based college, told this newspaper on Wednesday, “Covid-19 outbreak has given me a chance to fill the void between me and my family. After getting enrolled into my three-year course, this is the first time I am spending so much time with my parents. Even during holidays and semester breaks, I mostly did assignments and met old friends.”

Sharing similar views, software engineer Anand Gautam (25) said, “I am spending time with my parents. My mother is also giving me cooking lessons.”

The 21-day lockdown has given many people a chance to pursue their hobbies.

Sketching and making crafts have always been the favourite pastime of Notre Dame Academy student Hansika. “I hardly get time for these due to school and coaching classes. With too much time on my hands, I have made 15 sketches in the last 10 days,” she said and added, “I have even started watching online videos to learn different styles of painting.”

Psychiatrists in the city also encourage people to use the lockdown period to do something constructive.

Clinical psychologist Dr Binda Singh said, “People should talk less about Covid-19. By doing so, they will get positive vibes and feel good.”
