2020-04-05
DMK chief M K Stalin on Saturday advised people to read books, speak to senior citizens in the homes and maintain social distancing norms within families till April 14 to remain healthy. 


In a nine-minute video released by DMK, Stalin said it would be boring for people, who have led an active life, to remain confined to their homes. But there was no other alternative to prevent spread of the virus attack, he said. 

"It is my practice to meet people daily, but after the lockdown started, I am not able to meet anyone. That is why I am communicating to you through this video," he said.
