Dehradun: A leopard entered the premises of Haridwar’s Mela Hospital, which has been earmarked for Covid-19 patients, on Saturday morning According to hospital staff present on the spot, the big cat caught hold of a monkey and devoured it.

Staff members alleged that leopards have been spotted in the area with increasing frequency. “Barely a month ago, a dog was taken away and devoured by a leopard. We have repeatedly urged the forest department to take action but nothing concrete has been done so far. Fortunately, all staffers were indoors when the leopard was strolling on the terrace,” said Rajendra Kumar, whose daughter first spotted the leopard at around 6:50 am.

Disturbed at such instances, the hospital staff has handed over a memorandum to the forest department and also threatened to sit on a protest if the department takes no action in this regard.

“It is a matter of grave concern for us as the staffers have to look after coronavirus patients and also deal with wild animals foraying into the area,” said Dinesh Lakhera, general secretary, Fourth Class State Employees Union, Health and Family Welfare Services, Uttarakhand. 

Notably, Mela Hospital area is close to Rajaji Tiger Reserve which is why the wild animals find it easy to prey in this surroundings. Also, less human movement due to the lockdown has pushed wild animals to enter into the city from different and new routes, according to forest officials.

The newly-appointed director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve Amit Verma told TOI, “We have always actively responded to all the rescue calls in that area. As per our team on the ground, a wall needs to be erected to prevent animals from entering into human habitation.”
