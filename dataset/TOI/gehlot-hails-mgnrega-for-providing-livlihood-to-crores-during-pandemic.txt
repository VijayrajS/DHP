JAIPUR: Highlighting the importance of MGNREGA, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that in the era of Covid-19 pandemic, UPA government’s ambitious scheme has established its importance. During a video conference with his cabinet ministers along with sarpanchs, gram sewaks, patwaris, BLOs, ANM, Asha Sahyoginis and gram panchayats on Saturday, he said, “The manner in which this scheme has extended support to the crores of Indians in the rural areas shows the success of this scheme. At a time when people have lost their source of livelihood, this scheme has come to their rescue.” 

He demanded that the Central government should increase the working days under MGNREGA from 100 to 200 and also reduce the number of hours keeping in mind the intense heat.

While interacting with the CM, gram sewaks demanded uninterrupted supply of electricity in the locust-affected areas. They contended that while carrying out anti-locust operations in the affected areas they require water to mix chemicals in tankers. Gehlot assured them of proper supply of power to pump water in these areas.

Health minister Raghu Sharma informed that soon the state’s Covid testing capacity will jump from 17,500 to 25,000. “The state is adding two testing machines from US, each with a testing capacity of 4,500 per day. Soon, testing will start in 10 districts which are witnessing a spike in the number of cases due to migrants,” said Sharma.
