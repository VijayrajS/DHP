MUMBAI: A day after Cooper Hospital issued a circular asking third- and fourth-year medical students to return to campus for Covid-19 duty, colleges attached to KEM and Nair Hospitals too released similar instructions to their students. However, both the colleges have made the decision voluntary. Students volunteering for Covid-19 duty have been promised an incentive of Rs 30,000 per month and also have been told the duty period will be deducted from their bond service.


A circular issued by Nair Hospital (TN Medical College) requested students from second, third minor and major students (meaning ones from third and fourth year) to “join as Covid warriors.” “These medical students will be trained to do various jobs either in the community, in war room or in jumbo care facilities for Covid patients in Mumbai,” read the circular. It further added that their efforts will be appreciated with a certificate that will enhance their bio-data. Food and accommodation will be taken care of by the college, added the circular. At KEM, (GS Medical College), third-year minor students, the ones living in Mumbai or currently in hostel, will be given more of counselling and other ground-level work.
