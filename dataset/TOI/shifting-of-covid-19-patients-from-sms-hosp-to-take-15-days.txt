Shifting of Covid-19 patients from SMS Hosp to take 15 days
2020-05-12
Jaipur: Sawai Man Singh (SMS) medical college will take important decision on shifting of Covid-19 patients from SMS hospital in a meeting on Tuesday. SMS hospital was converted into dedicated Covid-19 treatment hospital ever since Covid-19 patients started reaching the hospital in increased numbers in last week of March and first week of April. Since the first case was reported on March 3, the hospital has provided treatment to more than 600 Covid-19 patients.

As the state government has decided to normalise the situation at SMS hospital to cater to patients suffering from other diseases, the SMS medical college was directed to free SMS hospital from Covid-19 patients.

“It will take at least two more weeks to shift the Covid-19 patients to other place and to develop the facility for treatment at that place,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS medical college.

In Tuesday’s meeting, decisions will be taken on shifting of medicine unit (team of doctors), nursing staff and other facilities to RUHS hospital, where it is likely the patients will be shifted.

The state government has realized that the patients suffering from other ailments apart from Covid-19 were reluctant to go to SMS hospital. The government has decided to disinfect the hospital and to create fearless atmosphere for other patients suffering from other diseases. Over the past two months, the number of registration at out-patient department has decreased significantly.

Jaipuria Hospital, which was one of the Covid-19 treatment hospitals, has also shifted the Covid-19 patients to RUHS hospital to start the OPD just like it was doing before Covid-19 outbreak.
