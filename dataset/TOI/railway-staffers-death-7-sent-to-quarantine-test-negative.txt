2020-05-01
AGRA: Day after a 59-year-old fourth grade railway employee allegedly committed suicide inside quarantine facility of a private hospital after waiting for his Covid-19 report for eight days, the district administration in collaboration with railway, shifted the remaining seven staff to railway quarantine facility.

Interestingly, just a few hours after the reported suicide of railway employee, district administration pushed the test samples of all eight employees on priority and claimed that all eight were found negative.

On Thursday, divisional railway manager of Prayagraj Amitabh Kumar said, “Since the quarantine centre and isolation facility are prerogative of state authorities, we had made special request to district administration to shift the seven railway employees to our quarantine facility, as they were disturbed after the death of their colleague - to which the district administration agreed.”

Also, he added that no medical reason was found behind the railway employee’s suicide, but "still we are not sure what triggered him to take the extreme step. The civil police is investigating. His body has been handed over to the family".
