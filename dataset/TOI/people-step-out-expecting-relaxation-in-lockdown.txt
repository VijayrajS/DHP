However, police officers said that the cops rushed to the areas concerned and took charge of the situation as soon as they received information about the violations.Residents of Trimurti Chowk, Pawan Nagar and Sawata Nagar said that while most people had stayed inside their homes for close to a month, on Monday, a large number of citizens were seen moving around on the streets freely. These areas are in the Ambad police stationâ€™s jurisdiction.The locals said that some people were maintaining social distance or wearing masks in the city markets.Kumar Chaudhary, senior PI of the Ambad police station, said there was a misconception among people that the lockdown had been relaxed and that is why they ventured out. Some also stepped out to purchase grocery items and vegetables.He said that since vegetable vendors and grocery stores have been instructed to operate only between 10 am and 4 pm, people rushed to the markets early to avoid stepping out in the afternoon heat.Chaudhary added that on getting information, police personnel rushed to the areas concerned. However, the patrolling teams had already instructed people lingering on the streets for no reason to return home.Other parts of the city, like Jail Road, Nashik Road, Panchavati areas etc. also witnessed a similar rush to the markets.Senior police officials said that the police personnel were making all efforts to ensure that people did not come out of their houses for unnecessary reasons. They added that it was also the responsibility of the citizens to adhere to the lockdown rules.The police, meanwhile, have been spreading awareness. Those now following the orders are being booked. More than 1,700 people have been booked under section 188 of the IPC for disobeying the police orders so far.
