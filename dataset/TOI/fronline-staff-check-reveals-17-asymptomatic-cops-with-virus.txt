2020-06-14
CHANDIGARH: As many as 17 Punjab police personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 in a random sampling carried out of 7,165 posted in various police stations and on other frontline jobs.

Out of the 17 positive cases, 14 belonged to the district police; two (including a cook) were from state armed police/Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) and one from Punjab home guards. Sangrur has reported the maximum number of positive cases. All the 17 infected were posted in isolation, either in civil hospitals or in the Covid care centres established by the Punjab health department.

Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said while 1,868 of the 7,165 samples collected till June 12 had tested negative, results for 5,280 were pending. He added that the sampling process was started on June 1 and efforts were being made to test a maximum number of police personnel posted in police stations and other high risk areas on a daily basis depending upon the spare sampling and the testing capacity available with the health department.

Punjab DGP had ordered a special RT-PCR Covid testing drive amid apprehensions of a spike in cases in the wake of relaxation of the curfew in the state. Around 48,000 Punjab police men and women were on continuous frontline duty for almost three months during the statewide lockdown. 

 A Covid positive ASI with co-morbidities has been reported to be in critical condition in Amritsar, said the DGP, adding he was not part of the random sampling exercise.
