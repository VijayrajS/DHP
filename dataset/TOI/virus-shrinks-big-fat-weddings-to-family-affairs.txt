Mangaluru: Virus shrinks big, fat weddings to family affairs
2020-05-02
MANGALURU: The virus has certainly hit big, fat Indian weddings this year and couples-to-be are now just hoping there’s a let-up for a simple ceremony — with masks in the ensemble and socially-distanced family photos. In Dakshina Kannada alone, more than 100 families are scrambling to put plan B in operation for weddings after May 3, dialling priests, local politicians and authorities to figure out quick ceremonies, permissions needed and suitable venues. 

Bharat (all names changed), for instance, is to marry on May 24. The 29-year-old businessman got engaged to a girl from a neighbouring district in February, in a modest ceremony at her residence. The families had decided on a temple wedding in the morning, followed by a lavish reception for 2,000-odd guests. “We are expecting some relaxation in the lockdown after May 3 and hope the temple wedding can go on as planned. If not, we will hold a small ceremony at home. The reception, of course, stands cancelled. We have approached the district minister for permission. He has put our request on hold as he feels it’s too early to decide,” Bharat said.
