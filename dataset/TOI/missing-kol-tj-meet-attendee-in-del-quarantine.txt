2020-04-09
Kolkata: West Bengal’s hunt for a Nizamuddin Markaz attendee from Kolkata has ended at a quarantine centre in New Delhi.

According to sources in police, the Kolkata resident reportedly left his home near Park Street for the religious congregation in Delhi along with seven others, but never returned. 

Based on the Centre’s report to the state, this person’s name figures on a list of 71 people who are believed to have attended the Tablighi Jamaat event. While the others have been traced over the past few days, this person was “missing” until now. Cops here contacted Delhi police and the person was finally tracked down at a quarantine centre in the national capital.

Police have dismissed as “speculative” some reports that suggested that six persons from Bengal who went to the markaz are still missing. “Everyone who participated in that event in Delhi and has Kolkata links is accounted for,” said a senior officer.

Cops have traced one person to Beniapukur and one to Belgachhia whose links with Tablighi Jamaat are being looked into. “So far, we have not linked them to the congregation,” said a source.

Altogether, 225 attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat meet in Delhi and their contacts have been placed under quarantine in Bengal, a senior health department official had said last Friday.
