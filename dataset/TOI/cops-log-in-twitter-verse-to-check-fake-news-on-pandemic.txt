Cops log in Twitter-verse to check fake news on pandemic
2020-04-28
PRAYAGRAJ: Panic ensued in the city after a fake post about a policeman and a driver posted at Karma police outpost testing positive for Covid-19 went viral on social media on Sunday. The post had claimed that the entire staff of the outpost had been made to undergo thermal screening. It was only after Prayagraj police quashed the news on its Twitter handle that many in the city heaved a sigh of relief. 


Sunday’s incident is one of the many instances in the recent past when city police have taken to Twitter to bust myths and fake news related to the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.

On April 25, police used its official Twitter handle to dispel rumours about three more Covid-19 patients being reported in Naini. 

A five-member team of police’s social media cell has been keeping an eye on rumourmongering and fake messages being circulated on various social media platforms ever since the lockdown was enforced on March 23. 

SSP (Prayagraj) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “We have been keeping a strict watch on social media platforms and those trying to spread rumours have been booked under appropriate sections of the Indian Penal Code.” 

The SSP said that police were duly replying to queries posted by Prayagraj residents on its Twitter handle.

Police cybercell has so far questioned over 30 people for allegedly spreading rumours on social media during the lockdown. A few social media groups are being closely watched round the clock, said sources. 

Police also arrested 20 persons and registered 47 FIRs in connection. Over 200 people have also been issued warnings against sharing fake news. Police sources said that most of the fake news were mostly about the spread of Covid-19 and rumours about a new containment zone.
