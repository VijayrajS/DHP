2020-02-04
Meerut: Days after a youth allegedly killed a fruit bat perched on a tree near his house in Shivlok Colony here, believing that it is responsible for spreading the dreaded coronavirus, the forest division has taken up the task of launching a campaign to make people, especially schoolchildren, aware that there is no link between this nocturnal mammal. The viral infection that has taken a toll of 360 people in China, the country of the deadly virus originated. 

The reason for killing is being attributed to social media reports that the coronavirus permeated humans through the bat soup which is widely consumed in China.

The fruit bat, also known as Indian Flying Fox, is one of the largest species of bats found in South Asia. It mainly lives on ripe fruits and is not a carnivorus. The fruit bat is a part of the megabat family. All megabat species are listed as “threatened” by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Some species are listed as “critically endangered”, “endangered”, and “vulnerable”.

Following the killing of the bat, Meerut divisional forest officer Aditi Sharma said, “Although the killing of the bat is an isolated incident, we have to prevent the escalation, particularly in the backdrop of conflicting media reports. It is still to be proved that a bat is responsible for the spread of coronavirus. There is no authenticity in social media reports. So, we will educate masses, especially schoolchildren, not to fall in the trap.”

The coronavirus scare is escalating in the country after three people tested positive in Kerala. The virus has spread to two dozen countries and WHO has also declared the crisis a global health emergency. Soon after the outbreak of the deadly viral disease, reports began emerging connecting it to bat soup, which is quite common in China so much so that a video of a woman consuming the soup also went viral.
