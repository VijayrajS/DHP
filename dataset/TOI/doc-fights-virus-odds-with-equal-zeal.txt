2020-04-02
Surat: A 50-year-old senior doctor at the New Civil Hospital (NCH) and part of the team that is working to develop Covid-19 hospital in record time despite being allegedly manhandled by the cops during duty. The in-charge assistant resident medical officer (RMO) of NCH is, however, resiliently working on for Covid-19. 

"I think it is an opportunity for a doctor to work at this time of crisis. I am round-the-clock and supporting my colleagues who are giving their all in this situation," said Dr Onkar Chaudhary, who was reportedly hit and abused by few a policemen and a private person on March 24 when he was driving his car near Gujarat Gas circle.

The man in civvies stopped Chaudhary and asked him to show his identity card. Chaudhary had already put up a notice on his car about his profession and involvement with the duites in fighting the spread of Covid-19. But even amid this, the man allegedly abused Chaudhary and later a few other cops too joined in the insult and reportedly punched Chaudhary in the back even after checking his ID card.

"It was a shocking, but the incident did not deter me. I am continuing my duties after reporting the issue to senior police officials and my department," Chaudhary told TOI.

"Sometimes one has to work in challenging situation and that is the actual role of a doctor," he added.
