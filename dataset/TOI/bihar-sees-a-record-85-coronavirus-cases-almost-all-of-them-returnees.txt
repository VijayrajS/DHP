PATNA: The state recorded the largest single-day spike with 85 fresh Covid-19 positive cases and sixth death due to coronavirus on Sunday. This took the tally of coronavirus cases in Bihar to 696.


The total number of active cases in state now stands at 336 while 354 have recovered. Principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said almost all new cases are those who had returned to Bihar by special trains from Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and other states this week. “Their samples were collected from the quarantine centres where they have been kept for 21 days. The health department teams collected the samples randomly as it is not possible to test all the people coming from other states,” he said.

A 60-year-old man from Patna district died on Sunday before his test report came. He was suffering from last-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs, a health department official said. “His result came negative,” PMCH superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said.

Nine fresh cases were reported from Patna district, taking its tally to 61. State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ragini Mishra, said eight of them had come from outside the state last week. “Only a 56-year-old woman from Alamganj, who is a cancer patient, has no travel history. We are tracing her infection trail and collecting samples from family members,” she said.

Meanwhile, according to an IANS report, cases have surged once again in Telangana with 33 more people testing positive on Sunday, taking the state’s tally to 1,196. Officials said out of 33 new cases, 26 were reported from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Seven migrants also tested positive.
