JAISALMER: Due to corona pandemic, bereaved families are finding it difficult to immerse the ashes of their loved ones in the Ganges. The urns containing ashes are lying in crematorium and also in the houses of many people. At the Barmer crematorium, the capacity of locker to keep ashes is full. Only 72 urns can be kept at the locker, which was full before lockdown. After lockdown till April 30, around 90 people have been cremated and 44 families have taken their urns and now we have 46 excess urns. In such a situation, the excess 46 urns are to be kept in separate boxes. 


According to the Hindu ritual, the family members take the ashes to Haridwar on the third day but due to lockdown people are not able to go and urns are being kept at the crematorium. The ashes will be immersed in holy river after lockdown ends. Similarly, in Jaisalmer city, more than a dozen urns are kept at home.

In case of death government permission has to be taken from the administration to take body to the crematorium and only 20 people can attend the condolence meeting maintaining social distance.
