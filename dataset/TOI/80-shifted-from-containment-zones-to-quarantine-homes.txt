Bhubaneswar: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has so far moved 80 people from the city’s three containment zones to government quarantine facility here. Bhubaneswar currently has 31 active coronavirus cases. Suryanagar, Bomikhal and Kapilaprasad-Jadupur are its three containment zones.

Officials of the BMC said the people who had come in contact with Covid-19 patients, or were likely to come in contact with them if allowed to stay on in the containment zones, were the ones who had been moved to a government quarantine facility. Also, people who are suspected to have come in contact with the positive person but did not have space in their houses for proper quarantine had also been moved. “In such circumstances, many people don’t agree to come to government quarantine. We have to counsel them,” said a BMC officer. The BMC has been supplying food and other essential items on a daily basis to the facilities. According to the guidelines, if a person shows symptoms of Covid-19 during the quarantine period, he or she will be tested. If the test returns positive for the novel coronavirus, he or she will be shifted to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. So far, no one has had to be moved from government quarantine to hospital. The BMC, however, is facing a tough task to maintain the quarantine facilities. People in the localities where they are located are fearful. 

“The persons to be quarantined are brought from containment zones and other areas in an ambulance,” the officer added. At the government quarantine, each person gets his or her own room. No room is occupied by two persons. Hotels that had offered paid quarantine are now finding themselves without any customers. Initially, 27 people had opted for paid quarantine in the eight hotels designated for the purpose by the BMC. With most having completed their stay, the hotels now have only four persons in quarantine.
