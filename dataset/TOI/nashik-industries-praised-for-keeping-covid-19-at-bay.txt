Nashik: The Nashik district administration has appreciated the industrial units for adhering to the social distancing norms after they were given permissions to start production activities in their units. 

Over 600 companies with more than 60,000 employees were permitted to resume work in various places and different sectors. 

District collector Suraj Mandhare said as there have been no cases of Covid-19 from the industrial parts, he gave go-ahead to private firms. “The industries have been working smoothly and appear to be observing all the safety measures told to follow. If things remain the same way, we will have the economic activities gearing up. We hope the things continue and improve,” he said. 

Mandhare, however, expressed his concern over the rising cases after things started opening up. “It appears that after stores started opening, some people are lacking the gravity of the situation. This is going to affect the society and not the individual, hence every single person has to be vigilant against the contagion one hundred percent of times,” he added. 

He warned that if the same carelessness is continued, harsh decisions have to be taken. “The administration and the health agencies are well prepared to ensure they respond to each and every call of Covid-19 at any given time. From the start, we have kept vigil on district check posts and the health checkups. Given the current situation, if people fail to keep the spread under check, they will invite trouble,” the collector said. 

He thanked the health agencies, police, and other department officials for doing their job efficiently.
