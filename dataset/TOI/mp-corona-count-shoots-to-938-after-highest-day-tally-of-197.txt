2020-04-16
INDORE/BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh recorded its highest ever daily Covid-19 tally on Wednesday when a whopping 197 samples test positive, 153 of them from Indore.


MP’s corona count rocketed to 938, the fifth highest in the country. The day’s count was the second highest among states, behind only Maharashtra that saw a jump of 232.

 

“We had issued a list of 117 positive patients this morning. It was updated by afternoon as we received reports of 36 more samples as positive,” CMHO Dr Praveen Jadia said. The state bulletin recorded Indore’s day’s tally as 133, but the total matched -- 544.

Reports of 500 of the 1,147 samples sent to Delhi are awaited and Indore’s count could rise further, Jadia said, adding: “We have already kept most of the people, whose sample reports have come positive, in quarantine facilities.”

One of the latest cases is a police station in-charge. “We have started tracing his primary contacts for screening and are taking other efforts to control spread of the disease through them,” the CMHO said.

Due to lack of coordination between the health department and MGM Medical College, a complete bulletin could not be released.
