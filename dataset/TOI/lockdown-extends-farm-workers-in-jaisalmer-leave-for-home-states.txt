2020-04-16
Jaisalmer: Disappointed with Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s announcement about extension of lockdown period till May 3, many labourers who had come to Indira Gandhi Canal area in Jaisalmer for harvesting crops in January, have started to leave for their home states.

These farm workers can be seen walking along the railway tracks towards their destinations. 

At many places, the railway station masters are stopping them and persuading them to go back. At some places, these people have stopped, but a large number is still walking towards their houses.

District collector Namit Mehta and SP Kiran Kung had visited many places in canal areas on Monday and directed to stop the labourers and arrange food and shelter for them.

The district administration and police teams have started making efforts to stop them at various check-posts and road routes, but the labourers are not ready to listen to them and continue walking even leaving their belongings behind.

On Tuesday, dozens of labourer groups from Sodhakor village were going towards Pokhran along the railway tracks. 

Lathi railway station master reached the spot and persuaded them to go to the Government Senior Secondary School.

Collector Mehta said that around 300 labourers have left Mohangarh, Nachna and other areas who were stopped. Many others were stopped near Ramdeora. They were persuaded and shifted to schools. The state government has been apprised about the problem of labourers leaving the place. He said that better arrangements of shelter and food for these labourers have been made.

SP Kung said that many labourers from the canal areas are leaving for their homes and police are trying to stop them and persuading them, but the labourers are not listening. Patrolling has been also increased in the area.
