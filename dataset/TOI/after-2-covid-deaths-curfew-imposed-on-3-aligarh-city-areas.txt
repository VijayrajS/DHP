Agra: Aligarh district administration has imposed a week-long curfew in three major areas of the city from Wednesday after two patients from these localities succumbed to coronavirus on Tuesday. 

The toll of Covid-related deaths in the district has gone up to five now.

According to an administrative official, the curfew was imposed in Sasni Gate, Delhi Gate and Kotwali areas as a precautionary measure to prevent possible community transmission in the area. A few positive cases, with no apparent contact with infected patients, have been discovered in these areas.

The decision to impose the curfew was taken after the death of two patients, including a woman who was undergoing treatment at Delhi’s hospital. Another deceased, who was a real estate businessman, breathed his last at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Tuesday morning. He was admitted to hospital a day earlier with complaint of breathlessness along with high fever. He was put on a ventilator on Monday night but could not survive.

According to health department, the deceased had organized a religious ritual at his residence two days ago after the death of his mother. Several local residents, including politicians, had participated in it. The administration is preparing a list of the people who attended in order to isolate them. 

The businessman’s body will be cremated as per Covid guidelines, said a health official.

Talking with TOI, district magistrate CB Singh, said, “We have decided to impose a complete lockdown in these areas as a large number of cases have been reported from there.”

Around 200 samples were collected after the death of the two patients and all have been asked to quarantine themselves at home till their report comes. Till now, 60 patients have tested positive for coronavirus in the district.
