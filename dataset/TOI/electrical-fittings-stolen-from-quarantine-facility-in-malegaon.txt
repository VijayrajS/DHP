Nashik: A building in Malegaon, at Mhada Colony in Mhalde village, which had been acquired to set up a Covid-19 quarantine facility, was recently broken into and ceiling fans, bulbs and other electrical fittings worth nearly Rs 30,000 were stolen from there.

Sources in the Pawar Wadi police station said that the theft took place between 11 pm on May 13 and 7 am on May 14. The building did not have any Covid-19 patients at the time.

With many patients getting discharged, several quarantine facilities have also become vacant. Taking advantage of the empty building in Mhalde village, some unidentified burglar made away with 18 ceiling fans from different rooms. They also stole 60 LED bulbs and other electrical articles.
