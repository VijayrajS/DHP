Kochi: Ernakulam rural police have released a list of restrooms arranged at petrol pumps in the district for people on their way to quarantine from other states and countries. Police said they are putting out the list of these facilities so that those who are on their way to quarantine could use them and stay away from the ones used by public.

Facilities have been arranged at fuel pumps at Arikupurath, Arakkunnam, Arayankavu, Pezhakkappilly, Chengamanadu, Arakkapady and Vengola, among other locations.

The rural police have released the phone numbers of these outlets as well as their geolocation links on its Facebook page.

“The facilities are arranged across the state keeping in mind those who are on their way home or institutional quarantine. If they use the facilities used by the general population, it would affect containment strategy. That is why such restrooms have been arranged,” said Ernakulam rural SP K Karthick.

He added that the names and locations of the district are being publicised so that anyone coming from the affected areas can use them. “A list has been given to drivers of KSRTC buses that carry passengers returning from other states or countries. The KSRTC staff can also contact the police through a helpline number and seek assistance from police vehicles escorting them who will guide them to the nearest restrooms,” said the SP. He added that those who are in special cabs or private vehicles on their way to quarantine can also make use of the facilities.
