Meet the creator of mural at Tambaram station that salutes COVID-19 warriors
2020-05-23
The 100ftX50ft mural at the Tambaram railway station is hard to miss if you are passing by. A tribute to the frontline workers fighting the pandemic, the mural covers the west entrance wall of the railway station and is created by Chennai ponnu Varshini Ramakrishnan, who calls herself a design strategist. 

“People have been telling me that it has come out well, but I am yet to see it in person. I have only seen photographs of the completed work. I am waiting for the lockdown to be lifted so I can go there,” she says matter-of-factly.




So, how did she manage to do it without going to the site? “The entire work was done on my laptop. It’s a vinyl decal, not a painting. Once I completed the sketches, they were printed and pasted on the wall. This is my first mural artwork and I’m excited,” she says. 




Her mural not only features doctors, nurses, policemen and sanitary workers, but also newspaper delivery boys, water can delivery men and vegetable vendors. “All of them have been continuously working through the lockdown. I didn’t want to miss any of them. Thankfully, the people from the railways, Nalandaway Foundation and Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India, with whom I collaborated for this, thought so, too,” she says.





Colours of positivityThe mural also depicts things and incidents that people relate with the pandemic, like the corona helmet, trains coaches converted into isolation wards, people washing hands etc. I used colours that depict things we associate with positivity — like rainbows, multi-coloured temple gopurams, among others.
