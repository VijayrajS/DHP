PUNE: The Pune Zilla Parishad has established 50 Covid care centres across 13 tehsils in the district.

The ZP has also set up 17 dedicated centres, which are linked to Covid care centres in each tehsil. 

Thousands of people have returned from red zones to their villages in the district in the last two weeks. Hence, cases are on the rise in rural areas. Over 600 positive cases, including 125 active, have been reported from all tehsils till date. 

Additional chief executive officer Bharat Shendge told TOI, "We have converted colleges and hostels into Covid care centres. A team of doctors from the health department inspected these facilities before declaring them as care centres. They are connected to dedicated centres to ensure that patients get treatment in time during emergency. At present, 32 centres are functioning at full capacity and the remaining 18 have been kept on standby." 

Naval Kishore Ram, district collector, said, "Our endeavour is to collect swab samples from people who have returned to the villages from Mumbai and Pune."

Tehsils like Khed, Ambegaon and Daund did not have a single case two weeks ago, but have now reported active cases. "We have established more centres ther," Ram added. 

The ZP is in the process of establishing 24 additional dedicated centres in the district.
