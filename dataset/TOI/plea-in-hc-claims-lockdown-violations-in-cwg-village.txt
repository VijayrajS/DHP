Plea in Delhi high court claims lockdown violations in CWG Village
2020-04-24
NEW DELHI: A resident of upscale Commonwealth Games Village (CWG) flats has moved Delhi high court complaining that locals are violating the lockdown norms. He has claimed that the residents are regularly going out for walk in the park, not maintaining social distancing and also not wearing mandatory masks. The high court agreed to examine the plea next week.


The application was filed in a pending petition relating to RWA elections and the high court had earlier appointed a retired district judge as the nodal officer who was permitted to act to the limited extent of making payment of essential service charges.

In the latest plea, the resident has sought direction to permit the nodal officer to close the access gate from CWG village to the adjacent DDA park and to take all measure to ensure strict compliance of lockdown directives.

He says due to severe violations by certain residents of the village, an e-circular was issued by the finance management services agency, which is managing the operations and maintenance of the colony, directing the residents to stop visiting DDA parks and walks in the area, but it did not yield any results.

The plea said since complete grocery shops are not available within the village, residents have to go to nearby markets at Mayur Vihar, Pandav Nagar and Ganesh Nagar for buying essential items.

“Many of the areas in proximity to these places have been declared corona hotspots. In such circumstances, the village residents visiting public places like parks in large numbers and mingling with each other is a serious threat to the safety and security of all residents,” it alleged.
