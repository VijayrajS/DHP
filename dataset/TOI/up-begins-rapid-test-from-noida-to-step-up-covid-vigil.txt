UP begins rapid test from Noida to step up Covid-19 vigil
2020-04-20
LUCKNOW: UP government on Sunday launched antibody-based rapid testing for coronavirus from Gautam Budh Nagar which is home to 95 Covid-19 cases. The district accounts for about 9% cases in UP and 11.3% cases in top 10 districts.

Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said, “The purpose is to undertake better Covid surveillance in the district which has third largest burden of cases in the state.”

Giving information that rapid kits have been provided by the Centre, Prasad said: “ICMR-approved rapid kits can help in screening coronavirus cases in 30 minutes. The outcomes from Noida will be used to develop a template for surveillance in other affected districts.”

Officials, however, clarified that lab-based RT PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test would continue to be the confirmatory test.

Health officials said the kits were the need of the hour. “Cluster containment plan – under which hotspots have been made — is already in action. Aggressive surveillance and testing is a part of strategy and kits will naturally be needed,” a health officer said. Experts said the use of rapid kits for purely surveillance purpose was a good move as the outcomes gathered from rapid kits came with the challenge of diagnostic accuracy.

“There is a notable risk of getting false positive or negative cases with rapid kits. Limiting its use for surveillance purpose appears to be a good way to overcome the barrier,” said a veteran microbiologist at KGMU.
