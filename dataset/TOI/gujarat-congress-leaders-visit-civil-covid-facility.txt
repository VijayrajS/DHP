Gujarat Congress leaders visit Civil Covid facility
2020-05-27
GANDHINAGAR: A delegation of Congress leaders visited the Asarwa Civil Hospital on Tuesday to study the condition of its Covid-19 treatment facilities, even as the high court slammed the government over the condition of the hospital’s treatment facilities.


GPCC president Amit Chavda, who along with leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani and few MLAs visited the hospital, criticized the government for not conducting adequate tests, because of which people were being admitted to hospitals in a critical stage. The delegation had to wait for about an hour, as M M Prabhakar, the officer on special duty for 1,200-bed Covid facility, could not make himself available. Chavda asked if the official was acting at the behest of state health minister Nitin Patel by not meeting them.

Other doctors refused to share any information about the treatment for Covid-19 patients or speak about the controversial Dhaman-1 ventilators, which were developed by Rajkot-based firm Jyoti CNC and supplied to government hospitals, he said.

“However, they agreed that it was not a ventilator, but was just a machine that supplies oxygen to patients,” he said. Chavda further claimed that doctors had attributed the high mortality rate at the hospital to low testing rates, which had led to delayed diagnosis and admission. 

Dhanani accused the government of wrongdoing over Dhaman-1 ventilators and said the equipment had received approvals within 24 hours and it was supplied in large numbers to government hospitals even when it was not effective on critical Covid-19 patients, as stated by experts. He alleged that an Ahmedabad-based firm had got the job of upgrading these ventilators with an additional cost of Rs 2.91 lakh per unit without a proper tendering process.

Meanwhile, state BJP spokesperson Prashant Vala hit back at the Congress, saying it was making baseless allegations.
