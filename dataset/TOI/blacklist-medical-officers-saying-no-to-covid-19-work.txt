2020-04-25
Kolhapur: District collector Daulat Desai issued an order on Friday stating that all the newly appointed medical officers, who were refusing work related to Covid-19 management, would be blacklisted and not be able to apply for government service in future. 

Desai said that it had come to the fore that many individuals, who were applying and getting selected for Covid-19 management work, were refusing to join on one or the other context. 

When TOI contacted him, the district collector said that there were atleast four medical officers in different parts of the district, who were selected in the latest appointments. However, they refused to join work stating reasons like they lived far from the city or that they were not interested in the role any more. 

Desai added that after the order for blacklisting those who were refusing Covid-19 management duties were issued on Friday evening, at least three of them agreed to join the workforce from Saturday.

E-pass facility for government employees

With the lockdown in place, a few government employees who had travelled to their hometown have got stuck there. Such employees can apply for e-pass at kolhapur.gov.in website. The respective taluka’s tehsildar will send an e-pass on the employee’s mobile number.

Meanwhile, an online payment facility has been made available for the district disaster fund on kolhapur.gov.in website.
