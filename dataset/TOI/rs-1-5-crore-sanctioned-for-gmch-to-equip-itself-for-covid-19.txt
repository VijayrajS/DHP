Aurangabad: During his visit to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Wednesday, MLA Pradeep Jaiswal reviewed the preparedness and infrastructure of the state-run hospital for Covid-19 management. 

The hospital will receive Rs 1.5 crore for necessary upgradation and equipment for managing coronavirus from the district planning committee funds.

To ensure that the district is well-equipped to handle any emergencies that arise from coronavirus outbreak, the district administration has allocated funds to strengthen the health machinery in district.

District collector Uday Chaudhari said that a sum of Rs 1.5 crore has been approved for GMCH Aurangabad. Funds of Rs 2.5 crore have also been approved for the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to purchase medical equipment and make adequate arrangements for treatment of suspected coronavirus patients, he said. The AMC has sought Rs 4.5 crore from the district administration for the purpose. 

The district administration said that looking at the timely utilization of the amount, more funds can be released to the civic body for coronavirus prevention and control.

Incidentally, the GMCH is the only tertiary care state-run hospital in the district. Apart from Aurangabad district, it caters to patients from across Marathwada and nearby districts. In the view of Covid-19 threat, the GMCH has converted its cardiovascular thoracic surgery building into coronavirus treatment ward where 22 isolated beds and ventilator support have been arranged. The hospital, however, have been asked to increase its coronavirus management beds to 100.

However, the state-run hospital runs short of medicines and crucial medical equipment. Therefore, it has sought financial assistance from the state government to increase its capacity.
