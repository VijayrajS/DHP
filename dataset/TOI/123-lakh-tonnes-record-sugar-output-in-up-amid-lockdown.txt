123 lakh tonnes: Record sugar output in UP amid lockdown
2020-05-23
LUCKNOW: While most industries faced a Corona-induced lockdown, UP’s sugar mills went full throttle to produce 123 lakh tonnes of sugar in this crushing season, recording their highest ever output, which is also a record production by any state in a season. In UP, the sugarcane crushing season is from October to May.

Records available with the sugar department till May 21 show that the output so far is at least six lakh tonnes more than 117 lakh tonnes of sugar produced in the corresponding period of the last season. UP’s previous record was registered in the 2017-18 season with an output of 120.45 lakh tonnes of sugar. The output is all set to increase further as 39 of the total 119 sugar mills are still running as nearly 10 more days are left in this crushing season. In contrast, only 16 mills were operating after the third week of May last year.

Significantly, while UP jacked up its production despite the lockdown, the national production of sugar in this season fell by nearly 62 lakh tonnes - from 326 lakh tonnes in the previous season to 264 lakh tonnes. UP accounts for 47% of the total national output so far.

According to Indian Sugar Mills Association, about 40% of the factories in central UP are still operating, while in west UP about 70% of the factories are still running. Principal secretary, cane development, Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that despite the lockdown, the state government ensured that the mills kept operating to crush canes brought in by farmers.

In the current crushing season, the state government paid farmers nearly Rs 19,000 crore, which is 56% of the total dues.
