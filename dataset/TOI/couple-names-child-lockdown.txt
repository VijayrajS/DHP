BOKARO: A Giridih-based couple, who had a newborn boy on Saturday, has named the child as ‘Lockdown’. The 30-year-old mother, Anuradha, delivered her first baby at a private clinic in Chaitadih.


Anuradha, a resident of Sihodih, said she thought the name as appropriate in times of lockdown and her husband and his family, too, agreed when she proposed the name for the child. “Neither grandparents have objected to the name. In fact, they have started calling the child as Lockdown. My husband, Pinku Verma, too, finds the name attractive,” Anuradha told local media.

Verma said the name of the child will help them remember about the lockdown in future. “Amid the negativity, the birth of our child is a pleasant news and hence, we chose this name. It’s brought smiles in times of worry and fears over the coronavirus,” he said.
