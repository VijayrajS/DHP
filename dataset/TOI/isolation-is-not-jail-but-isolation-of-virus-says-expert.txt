PANAJI: Some states have reported non-cooperation by persons suspected of Covid-19 to the extent that a few of them fled from the isolation facility much to the distress of health authorities, but so far Goa has not seen any such incident.

All 16 suspects in isolation at GMC complied with health authorities. Most of them have been discharged after completing the requisite isolation period, GMC doctors said on Sunday. 

 
 
“Their cooperation made the task easier. Isolation ward is not jail, but a facility created to isolate the virus,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said. 

The suspects as well as those under home quarantine, he said, have been extremely cooperative even when one of the suspect’s identity was disclosed by the media. “The suspect received a lot of calls after his name was disclosed, but he cooperated,” he said, adding that “public cooperation” is essential in eliminating chances of Covid-19 spreading. 

The suspects, Betodkar said, are not immediately discharged from the hospital even if they test negative for Covid-19. Doctors treating the patient decide if the person should continue to be in isolation or can be quarantined at home. 

“If a patient continues to be symptomatic, he or she will not be discharged immediately,” he said. 

No Covid-19 case has been detected in Goa yet, but the probability can’t be ruled out, specially when other states have reported cases. 

The state epidemiologist said that even if a Covid-19 positive case is detected in Goa it wouldn’t be a problem to control the virus from spreading, provided people help.
