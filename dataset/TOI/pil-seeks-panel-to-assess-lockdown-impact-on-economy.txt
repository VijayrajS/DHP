2020-04-29
The Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC on Tuesday fixed May 4 for hearing of a PIL, seeking constitution of a commission to assess the lockdown’s impact and losses on the economy. A bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice KS Pawar passed the order on the PIL, which also sought direction from the court to the Centre and state governments to quantify losses, not only to the exchequer, but of the public as well. The petitioner’s lawyer was not present during the hearing, which took place via video conferencing. However, the Centre’s lawyer S B Pandey said, he had not received a complete copy of the PIL. At this, the bench directed the petitioner to serve the PIL copy to the central government counsel and fixed a next date.
