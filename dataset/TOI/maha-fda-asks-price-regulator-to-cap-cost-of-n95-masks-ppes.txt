Maharashtra FDA asks price regulator to cap cost of N95 masks & PPEs
2020-05-15
MUMBAI: Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has urged drug National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), the drug price regulator, to ensure availability of N95 masks and PPE kits at a reasonable rate and plug overcharging of these items. 

With an alarming rise in Covid cases, which crossed 27,000 in the state on Thursday, the demand for N95 masks and PPE kits have increased. Prices of N95 masks have increased by nearly three to four times, while PPEs, some sub-standard, are being sold at different prices. Industry experts say false and fake certification is rampant, and fly-by-night manufacturers have surfaced in the absence of clear product specifications and monitoring by the government.

Pre-covid N95 masks were priced at Rs 45 per piece, while now it costs between Rs 200 and Rs 1,000 per piece. 

In a communication to the NPPA, Maharashtra FDA commissioner Arun Unhale said that the authority had asked for prices of hand sanitizers, surgical masks (2 and 3 ply) and N95 masks to be fixed on March 20. Thereafter, the ministry of consumer affairs had regulated the prices on March 21, but prices of N95 masks were not capped. In the absence of a price cap, doctors, patients, paramedical staff and health workers in private hospitals are forced to pay higher prices, the letter, a copy of which is available with TOI, says. 

Further, professionals involved in diagnostic laboratories are also at a risk of contracting the virus, with Jaipur-based Practicing Pathologists Society raising the issue with NPPA. It has come across numerous instances where vendors of N95 masks are charging exorbitant amounts, the letter adds.
