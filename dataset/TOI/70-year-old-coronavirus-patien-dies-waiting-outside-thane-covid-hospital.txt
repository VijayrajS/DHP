THANE: A 70-year-old coronavirus patient died outside a dedicated Covid hospital late on Thursday allegedly without getting medical attention. The incident came a day after another elderly Covid patient from the same area died outside his home. Experts say the incidents expose inadequacies in the infrastructure set up to combat Covid. 

When Thursday's victim was taken to the hospital, the authorities there started discussing whether to put him in ICU or admit him in the general ward; while a delay ensued in taking a decision, the elderly patient was lying on a stretcher outside the hospital building, gasping for breath, said corporator Narayan Pawar, who was assisting the family.

Pawar said the patient got his infection confirmed on Thursday morning, following which his panicked family called the Thane civic helpline, seeking an ambulance to shift him to a hospital in Panchpakhadi. But they got no response. Pawar claimed he intervened and obtained a general ward bed by evening, but at the hospital, after the discussion among the authorities, the family was ultimately told the man was critical and needed ICU. Then they were told that all beds in the hospital were occupied. Also, the authorities were allegedly clueless about any nearby Covid treatment facility.
