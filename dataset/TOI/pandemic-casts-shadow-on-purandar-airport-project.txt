Pandemic casts shadow on Purandar airport project
2020-06-03
Pune: Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC) officials fear that the proposed airport project at Purandar might be delayed by another year in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. 

“The pandemic, followed by rounds of lockdown, has taken a toll on the state’s exchequer. The state government has told all the departments to prepare with a list of the projects that were either on the anvil or recently announced. The government said it was not currently possible to undertake these projects, including the airport at Purandar, in this financial year,” a senior MADC official said. 

“The government also said that no new projects will be announced. It said work on certain projects, like that of the airport, can wait,” the official told TOI. 

Then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced the Purandar airport project in 2016. It was said that the airport would be ready for operations within five years. “Of what we have got to know, the government at present doesn’t have the funds for the Purandar airport, or any new infrastructure project. It was expected that the government would provide funds for the airport this year. But in the current scenario, it looks impossible. One doesn’t see complete revival before 2022,” another MADC official said.
