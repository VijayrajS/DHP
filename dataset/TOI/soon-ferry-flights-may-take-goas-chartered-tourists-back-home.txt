Coronavirus: Soon, ferry flights may take Goa’s chartered tourists back home
2020-03-13
PANAJI: The unprecedented decision to revoke all non-official visas and put India on lockdown from Friday onwards has led to all international charters from Russia and the UK being cancelled. 

But with over 1,000 international tourists still in Goa, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has begun discussions with international charter operators to facilitate the return of British and Russians to the home countries.

AAI officials at Goa airport are also in touch with the ministry of civil aviation. Russia and the UK have yet to announce sweeping travel restrictions.

“We have asked charter operators what they are doing to take the tourists back, and whether they will operate ferry flights. Planes for this purpose will come in empty,” a senior AAI official said.

Officials at Dabolim airport said around 50-60 charter flights booked till April-end have been cancelled due to the Covid-19 scare.

Tourists already in India can continue to remain in Goa till their visas expire. However, with many countries announcing a clampdown on international travel, many will be keen to return. Global flight restrictions have presented a double whammy for some tourists who find their holiday plans disrupted.

“I was going to India on Friday. But, because of coronavirus, India suspended my visa. Gutted,” said Bristol resident Darren Bell. For each arrival slot at Goa airport, charter operators pay Rs 1 lakh as security to AAI.
