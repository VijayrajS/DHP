2020-04-08
Bhopal: In a huge loss to betel leaf growers during the lockdown, standing crops have started withering and drying in Chhatarpur district, famous for the Mahoba variety of desi paan, that is popular across the country and abroad. The variety gets its name from Mahoba district of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh where a Paan research Institute also helps the farmers grow the leaves. The paan baraj, or the betel leaf fields, are spread over 1,500 hectares of land in Chattarpur.During the times of corona lockdown, the farmers have not been able to sell the leaves in the mandis of Chhatarpur from where it is transported to distant places like Mumbai, Delhi, Lucknow and Saharanpur. The paan grown here is also famous in Pakistan, said Jitu Chourasia, a paan farmer.He said that farmers have been plucking the dry and damaged leaves and disposing them in water bodies. Had there been no lockdown, Chourasia said that 5 to 6 quintals of betel leaves would have been sold every day.On an average, one farmer is incurring a loss of Rs 10,000 every day, said Maharaj Chourasia, another farmer. He said, “Crops were damaged because of the extreme winters last year. We thought we would compensate the loss in the summer crops. But as luck would have it, the coronavirus spread has shattered the hopes of farmers.”Chourasia said like wheat or pulses, betel leaves are not on the government’s priority list, so there was no question of compensation. Old-timers in Chhatarpur say the number of betel farmers has been dwindling rapidly over the last few years. A crispy flavour and its delectable aftertaste makes the Mahoba paan a favourite with connoisseurs in several states of northern India and abroad, they said.
