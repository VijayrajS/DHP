2020-06-05
LUCKNOW: The first phase of ‘unlock’ is scheduled to start from June 8 and Uttar Pradesh government has started preparations to enforce strict social distancing guidelines as more activities are permitted. 

Religious places, malls, restaurants, hotels and other hospitality industries will be permitted to open up from June 8.

Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi said chief minister Yogi Adityanath has started holding reviews to chart out social distancing and safety protocols to be enforced once these places are allowed to function. 

“The chief minister has said that we should wait for the central government guidelines on the opening of these places. Once they are released, the departments concerned should study the guidelines closely and then prepare protocols for safety and security,” Awasthi said.

As markets have already opened up in the state, the CM has directed the police to ensure patrolling in public places, especially crowded markets. The CM has said that there should be zero tolerance towards people flouting rules under the Epidemics Act and the police should strictly enforce rules about covering one’s face in public places, maintaining social distancing among other norms.

“The CM has asked the police to issue challans in case of violations, and also hand over two masks worth Rs 10 each to a person who is caught without face covering,” Awasthi said.

Following central guidelines so far, UP has allowed all industrial activity and permitted markets to open, unless they are located in containment zones. Strict guidelines have been set on thermal scanning, face covers, hand sanitizers and social distancing. 

Under Unlock-II, on which a decision will be taken by the Centre in July, schools, colleges and coaching centres will start functioning, while in the third phase, a decision will be taken on international flights, Metro rail services, gyms and cinemas.
