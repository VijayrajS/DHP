DHARWAD: A 33-year-old man who returned to Dharwad from Australia, and had tested positive for Covid-19, was discharged from the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi on Sunday after the doctors confirmed that he had recovered fully.


Dharwad deputy commissioner Deepa Cholan on Sunday confirmed the development to TOI. The infected man had returned from Perth in Australia on March 12, travelling by air via Dubai, Muscat and Goa. He was admitted to a private hospital in Dharwad on March 17 after he took ill. He was subsequently referred to KIMS, from whence samples of his blood and throat swab were sent for examination to a laboratory in Shivamogga. 

“He was being treated at KIMS, and the doctors sent his samples for examination again on March 31 and on Friday when they found that he was recovering. The results of the tests were found to be negative on both occasions, and consequently, he was discharged on Sunday,” Deepa added. 

The patient was the 21st to test positive for Covid-19 in Karnataka. Health department personnel managed to trace his primary contacts, all of whom were examined for the infection. None of them tested positive for the infection.
