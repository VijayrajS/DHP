PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday there are approximately 3.5 lakh migrant workers in Goa and data is being collected to make necessary arrangement for those who want to return to their respective states.


He said the government will provide free quarantine facility for Goans returning from other states.

“We are collecting the data of those who want to go back. We will submit the data to Centre to make necessary arrangement for special trains for those people,” Sawant told TOI.

He said those who have vehicles and want to return to their native state will be allowed to do so.

Even buses would be made available to migrants who want to travel to Maharashtra and Karnataka, but on the request of the respective state.

He said there are around 60,000 migrants staying in government camps and around 3 lakh in hotels.

Sawant said the Centre’s decision to start special trains will benefit migrants, students and tourists who want to go back to their respective states.

The chief minister said if a situation arises wherein the migrants are from Himachal Pradesh and a Delhi-bound train heading from Kerala via Goa is available, then a request would be made to the Centre to accommodate these workers so that they can go back their villages.

A senior government officer said that the bus fare has to be borne by the state that wants to take back their people. 

Sawant also said the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue lockdown till May 17 was taken in the interest of the people. He said Goa will follow Centre’s guidelines on Covid-19 for districts in green zone.
