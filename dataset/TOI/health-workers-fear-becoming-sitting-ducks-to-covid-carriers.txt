Madurai: After two health workers from the Katchaikatti primary health centre (PHC) in Madurai district, tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, frontline health workers have expressed concern as many patients are asymptomatic.The two workers were found to have handled three migrants from Maharashtra who had later tested positive. However, they had no symptoms.“We are not sure who we may have been exposed to. Apart from doctors, all other health workers, including those making door-to-door visits, are given only three-layered masks and the responsibility is with individuals to stay safe. Since many Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic, we fear for our safety and none of us are also tested unless we show symptoms,” said a PHC health worker on condition of anonymity.“It is not possible to provide health workers with personal protective equipment (PPEs). They are given masks, gloves and sanitisers. We urge them to practice social distancing. This is what is followed even in containment areas,” said a senior health official. Madurai district collector said that as per protocol, there is no need for periodical testing of frontline workers. “Testing is based on symptoms and contact history with a positive case, even for those working in quarantine facilities. We are trying our best to keep them safe. The workers are given training on preventive measures such as disinfecting with hand washing, and usage of PPEs,” the collector told TOI. He added that they are also provided with multivitamins, zinc tablets, kabasura kudineer and homoeopathy tablets to enhance their immunity.
