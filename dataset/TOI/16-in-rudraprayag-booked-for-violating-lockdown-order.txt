DEHRADUN: Sixteen people from Rudraprayag were booked on Monday for violating the lockdown order imposed by the state government to contain the spread of Covid-19.


The district authorities of Rudraprayag booked them under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for “unnecessarily roaming in market areas”.

The officials added that when these people were confronted, they started arguing.

“These 16 people were booked for roaming around in markets areas of Rudraprayag, Tilwada and Agastyamuni. When there is a complete lockdown, it is expected that the people abide by it and come out of the house only if there is some urgent need,” district magistrate Rudraprayag Mangesh Ghildiyal told TOI.
