Panaji: Goa’s active Covid-19 tally dropped to 39 on Tuesday after nine patients were cured and placed in facility quarantine. The number of patients cured of the novel coronavirus in Goa thus rose to 28. Tuesday was also the first time in more than ten days that the state didn’t see a single new case, with 536 of the 565 samples testing negative, and 29 results awaited.

The nine patients who were discharged on Tuesday will remain in facility quarantine for seven days, followed by another seven days in home quarantine.

As per the protocol followed by the state, a patient is tested twice, and only if both reports are negative is the patient declared recovered and discharged.

Tuesday also saw ten suspects admitted to isolation wards, and 647 persons placed in facility quarantine. In total, Goa has seen 67 cases of the novel coronavirus, of which 39 are active and being treated at the Covid hospital in Margao. 

Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday issued a notification specifying the standard operating procedure (SOP) for persons travelling by road, rail and air. While the SOP, issued on Sunday, was applicable for air and rail travellers from Monday, it was enforced for road travellers on Tuesday.
