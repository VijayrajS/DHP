2020-04-02
Kochi: The Covid-19 fear and lockdown have resulted in a decline in the number of cases and seizures under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (Cotpa) in Ernakulam excise division. Compared to February, the quantity of seized ganja and banned chewable tobacco products has reduced significantly in March. Around 3.27kg of ganja and 44kg of chewable tobacco were seized in March compared to 20.6kg of ganja and 907kg of chewable tobacco in February.

Excise officers said that the heavy patrolling and shutdown of traffic have led to decline in the inflow of contraband into the district. The suspension of passenger train services, which was a major mode of transportation of ganja and banned tobacco products, has completely curbed the inflow of these items from other states. But the officers said that they are expecting a rise in the seizure of illicit liquor and arrack in the coming days due to the shortage of alcohol amid the lockdown.

“The number of cases reported and seizures made were as usual till mid-March. But after the Covid-19 fear gripped the state, there was a decline. Moreover, after the lockdown started on March 25, the number of cases reported had declined significantly. The strict vigil at check posts, shutdown of railways and stringent travel restrictions have reduced drug trafficking. But cases of illicit liquor and arrack seizures are likely to rise in the coming days, especially in rural areas, where brewing is more possible,” said an excise officer.

At the same time, they warned of possible narcotic withdrawal syndrome cases in the coming days in addition to alcohol withdrawal syndrome. “The unavailability of narcotic drugs, especially the synthetic ones like LDS, MDMA and heroin, could lead to withdrawal cases. So far no cases have been reported. The department is closely monitoring the situation,” said the officer.
