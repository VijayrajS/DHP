Ludhiana: Admin yet to zero in on system to track quarantined
2020-04-04
LUDHIANA: Even as the Ludhiana district administration has home quarantined 5,172 persons so far, it has no system to keep a track of them.


As a result, the administration has requested residents to complain to it against those flouting home quarantine orders. On Friday, a Dehlon man lodged a complaint with the police that a couple of their area, who had recently returned from Dubai, goes for a walk in the locality even as they had been home quarantined from March 23 to April 8. “The administration has also pasted a notice outside their house,” he added. 

Regional Transport Office secretary Damanjit Singh Mann, who is also keeping a check on home quarantined people, said, “As many as 5,172 people have been home quarantined in the district till now. These people have been stamped and a poster pasted outside their houses, so that their area residents can identify them. Other than this, there is no system to keep an eye on them.”

“Ideally, those who have been home quarantined should follow the orders as it is for the safety of everyone. The administration has provided helpline numbers and asked their neighbours to complain if they break quarantine. On receiving such complaints, cops visit those areas to ensure compliance. The administration might consider tracking the cellphones of the quarantined,” Mann added. 

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “The police will register cases against those ignoring home quarantine under sections 188 (disobedience to orders duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC. Residents can lodge complaint against them.”

On its official Facebook page, Ludhiana Police on Friday asked residents to inform them about quarantine violators.
