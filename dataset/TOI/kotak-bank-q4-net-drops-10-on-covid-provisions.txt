2020-05-14
Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a net profit of Rs 1,267 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 — a drop of 10% from the Rs 1,408 crore recorded in the same period in the previous year, owing to additional provisions made towards Covid-19.

Addressing newspersons, Kotak Bank vice-chairman and CEO Uday Kotak said there was uncertainty because of the Covid-19 crisis as a cure had not been found and a vaccine would be 18 months away. Kotak said that exiting the lockdown would be a challenge. “It is easy to get into the lockdown, but getting out is difficult. It is like getting out of a ‘chakravyuh’.”

Kotak said that the bank’s provisions exceeded its gross non-performing assets. As a measure of caution, the bank made provisions for all loans that had not repaid on time and availed moratorium. On a consolidated basis, the bank reported a decline in net profit at Rs 1,952 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2020 from Rs 2,038 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year. Total income declined to Rs 12,085 crore during the latest quarter, down from Rs 13,823 crore.
