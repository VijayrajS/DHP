2020-03-18
Tamil Nadu Poultry Farmers’ Federation and Tamil Nadu Poultry Farmers’ Marketing Society have jointly announced a cash reward of Rs 1 crore to anyone who could prove that coronavirus (Covid-19) was spreading through chicken meat. 

The announcement was made at the poultry farmers’ meeting that was held in Namakkal town on Tuesday to take a few important decisions to save the industry after chicken meat price plunged to Rs 10 a kg from Rs 80, following rumours associated with Covid-19. 

They also said nearly 15 crore eggs have been stagnating in the poultry farms across the district. 

Addressing the media, ‘Vangili’ Subramaniam, vice-president, poultry farmers’ marketing society, said there wasn’t any proof to show that Covid-19 could spread through chicken meat. 

He said the poultry farmers were facing a loss of nearly Rs 8 crore a day and that broiler chicken trade worth Rs 15 crore was affected in the state. “The industry has faced a loss of nearly Rs 500 crore in the past two weeks.”

The poultry farmers have decided to meet chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami once again. “We will urge the government to advertise in print and electronic media for a month that chicken meat and egg won’t trigger Covid-19 outbreak. This is the only solution to save the industry,” Subramaniam said.
