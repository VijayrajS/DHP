108 ambulances step up to allay fears amid lockdown
2020-04-07
Vijayawada: The number of people availing themselves of 108 ambulance services in the state has increased in the past month following fears surrounding Covid-19. In March, these ambulances ferried over 3,600 persons with Covid-19-related health complaints to various hospitals. 

The 108 ambulances also served nearly 9,610 pregnancy-related emergencies, besides plying 850 people with cardiac-related problems to hospitals last month.

The emergency service is continuing to receive phone calls from persons fearing they have been infected with Covid-19 and requesting an ambulance to get themselves tested at a nearby hospital. 

An official in the health department said the response time in rural areas is around 20 minutes and 17 minutes in urban areas. 

“People with even a mild cough have been calling up for an ambulance under an emergency Covid-19 pretext. This is primarily not only due to the Covid-19 fears, but also due to the restrictions in the lockdown period. This may continue even in April. We hardly get 1,500 emergency calls a month other than for the regular diseases and medical conditions. But this time, the ambulances attended more than 3,600 suspected Covid-19 cases. Persons at the 108 call centres had to counsel hundreds of callers on the symptomatology of Covid to quell their fears,” said the official.

Pilots and other personnel in the 108 ambulances have been provided with personal protective equipment (PPE). The state government recently launched 108 bikes in tribal pockets to transfer tribal patients to nearby hospitals or main ambulances. 

These feeder ambulances have been working under the jurisdiction of various integrated tribal developmental agencies, including Paderu, Rampachodavaram, Seethampeta and Parvathipuram.
