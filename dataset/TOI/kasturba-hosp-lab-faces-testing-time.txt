Kasturba hosp lab faces testing time
2020-03-19
Testing for Covid-19 can be testing, as officials of the high-tech Kasturba Hospital’s molecular laboratory found out on Tuesday night. They managed to successfully turn around the situation though.

Kits for one of the three processes that make up the entire Covid-19 test were exhausted at Kasturba lab. This kit helps extract RNA from the patient’s swab sample; Covid-19 is an RNA virus. BMC procures these extractor kits from a French company, Biomerieux. But the kits were diverted to Italy, which is facing a severe outbreak, said sources. Quick thinking by senior doctors, who worked through the night to get kits from another manufacturer, ensured they reached the lab early on Wednesday. “We have also asked for more kits in keeping with the WHO’s directive to test and test more,” said a medical education department official. — Malathy Iyer & Clara Lewis
