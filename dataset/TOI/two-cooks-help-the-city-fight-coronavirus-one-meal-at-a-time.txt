Two cooks help Pune fight coronavirus, one meal at a time
2020-04-18
PUNE: Whether it is the kitchen at the Inspection Bungalow serving food to resident doctors of Sassoon General Hospital or the centralized kitchen at College of Engineering Pune serving three meals a day to around 550 homeless people in the city, the staff at these kitchens are working for over 10 hours a day to make sure people do not go hungry during the lockdown.

While the kitchen at the bungalow is run by the government-appointed cook Anthoni Dominic Rofel, the one at College of Engineering Pune is run by caterer Ambalal Mali, who hails from Rajasthan. 

41-year-old Mali wakes up every morning at 4am at his Bibvewadi house and reaches the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-run kitchen at CoEP an hour later. “One group of workers gets busy preparing the breakfast, which includes sabudana khichdi, pohe or Upeet, the other group is busy chopping, grating and grinding vegetables for the afternoon meal. By 6.30am, the breakfast is ready to be taken to various shelter homes,” said Ambalal, who would otherwise have been catering at weddings in the city.

For Anthoni Rofel (55), the day starts at 6am and ends at 10.30pm. “We serve 40 resident doctors of Sassoon Hospital, who are posted at the Covid-19 ward and hygiene is the topmost priority here. We wipe tables and chairs, where the doctors sit, multiple times. We have a buffet system so we do not directly come in contact with the doctors,” Rofel said.

While Rofel serves fewer number of people than Mali, since the doctors walk in at different times, the staff stays on till the kitchen closes at 10.30pm. “I have four daughters at home and they are worried about my health. I tell them that it is the job for which the government appointed me and I cannot back out of it in the time of need,” Rofel said.
