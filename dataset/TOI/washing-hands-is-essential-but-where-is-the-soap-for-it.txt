Coronavirus scare: Washing hands is essential, but where is the soap for it?
2020-02-05
CHENNAI: The messages stand out on posters at airports, hospitals and public places and blare out of health department press conferences – “washing hands with soap and running water can prevent transmission of novel coronavirus”. 

 
 
Toilets in general ward at the premier Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where eight Chinese passengers were kept in isolation, did not have soap for patients, though they had hand sanitizers at several places. The situation is the same in all government hospitals and offices. On Monday, health minister C Vijayabaskar said the health department has asked the education department to ensure school and college students practice hand hygiene and promote the practice at their homes.

Most city schools – private or public – do not provide soaps and running water in the toilets. “My daughter doesn’t use the washroom in school or consume water because there is no soap. She carries a hand sanitizer but the school does not permit her to use it as the teacher feels the scent from it distracts other students,” said Radhika R, a parent. Many eateries, public offices, bus stops and railway stations don’t stock up soap solutions in restrooms. 

Infectious disease experts say hand hygiene practices are a concern across the globe. “We are probably among the worse,” said P Kuganantham, former city health officer. “We should use this opportunity to change it. If we make hand hygiene a practice now, we will be able to prevent many ailments,” he said.
