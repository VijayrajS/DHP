PUNE: A 29-year-old man from the city, who had travelled to China recently, was quarantined at the PMC-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on Tuesday evening after he complained of minor influenza-like symptoms, including cold and fever.


His throat swab samples would be sent to the National Institute of Virology laboratory for testing on Wednesday to rule out a coronavirus infection. 


 
Earlier on Tuesday, the throat swab samples of a 51-year-old man — also quarantined at Naidu hospital — tested negative. The test results of the other man in quarantine are awaited. Both men had complained of similar symptoms.

The 51-year-old had returned recently from Shanghai, while the other man, a 30-year-old, had travelled to parts of Wuhan. 

“The 51-year-old tested negative for the novel coronavirus infection, when his throat swab samples were analysed at NIV’s laboratory,” public health expert Ramchandra Hankare, who is also the head of PMC’s health department, said. 

“He will remain isolated for a few more days only as a precautionary measure. We will retest his throat swab samples after two to three days,” Hankare said.

Three others from Pimpri Chinchwad, who travelled to China recently, have been under surveillance for 28 days. “The three travellers in Pimpri Chinchwad are showing no symptoms and so, they have not been isolated. Their samples have also not been sent for testing to NIV’s laboratory. We will only keep track of their health status over the telephone,” a state health official said.
