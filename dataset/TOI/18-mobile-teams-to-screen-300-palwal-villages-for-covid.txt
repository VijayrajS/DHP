Haryana: 18 mobile teams to screen 300 Palwal villages for Covid-19
2020-04-15
GURUGRAM: In a massive combing exercise to check Palwal residents for Covid-19 symptoms, the health department has formed 18 mobile teams that will visit 300 villages over the next 15 days to collect travel and contact data, and medically screen every resident. Each team will have a doctor, a nurse, an auxiliary nurse midwife worker and a paramedic who will travel in vans to designated villages.

The district has reported a total of 29 cases so far. Out of this, 28 were related to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held in Delhi last month. Officials of the health department say that since majority of the cases were people who are residents of other states or countries, and were only discovered in Palwal, this kind of exercise will help identify any person who has not come forward despite being in the contact chain.

“We are launching this drive in order to ensure that Palwal turns into a Covid-free district at the earliest. The teams will note down travel and health history of each resident, and will collect data from the entire district to isolate the infected from the healthy,” said civil surgeon Dr Brahmdeep Sandhu.

The department revealed 10 mobile teams will scan the Hatin block which has reported the highest number of cases, and two will inspect the urban areas of the district.

The department has five ambulances to take any suspected case to the hospital where they will be isolated and tested. The teams will also conduct awareness drives about sanitation and precautionary measures.
