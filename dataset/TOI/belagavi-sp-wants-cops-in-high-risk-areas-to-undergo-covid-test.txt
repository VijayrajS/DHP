2020-05-29
BELAGAVI: In the wake of five constables from Hassan deployed for duty on the Maharashtra checkpost testing positive for novel coronavirus, Belagavi superintendent of police said that cops in the district would have to undergo tests for Covid-19 sooner than later. 

SP Laxman Nimbargi said that nearly 2,800 policemen deployed on Covid-19 duty would be tested for the novel coronavirus. Nimbargi said that he had written to Belagavi deputy commissioner SB Bommanahalli requesting mass testing for all cops. 

In his letter to the DC, the SP has indicated that Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai was thinking along the same lines to prevent the possibility of an outbreak among the entire force. 

Nimbargi told TOI that he was awaiting a detailed report on the travel history of the five cops from Hassan who had been conformed infected. “The constables are discharging duties in high-risk areas such as Koganoli, Telasanga and Khanapur where there are tens of thousands of migrant workers who have returned to the state. “Moreover, police from Belagavi have also been deployed to neighbouring districts such as Haveri, Gadag, etc. They are at the risk of contracting the infection and it would be ideal to have all of them tested for Covid-19,” Nimbargi added. 

Belagavi district health officer Shashikant Muniyal said that the SP’s letter had been received at his office, and they were ready and prepared to work in containment zones. “However, the guidelines over testing having changed, it will be difficult to test all police personnel,” he added.
