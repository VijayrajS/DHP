Rajasthan health department declares Covid-19 an epidemic
2020-03-13
JAIPUR: The health department declared coronavirus an epidemic in the state and issued the Rajasthan Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations (REDCR), 2020, on Thursday.

The notification has been issued two days after an 85-year-old citizen, who returned from Dubai, was allegedly refused treatment by three private hospitals on March 8. He later tested positive for Covid-19 on March 10 at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital.

A private family doctor of the patient too failed to report the case to health authorities. He had gone to the doctor’s clinic for treatment on March 2 and March 8, increasing the risk of infecting others in the city.

Taking it as a major lapse, the health department has declared Covid-19 an epidemic and made it mandatory for each doctor in the state to report such cases immediately to health authorities. “It is mandatory for government and private hospitals and registered private medical practitioners, including Ayush practitioners, to notify such persons to concerned district surveillance units along with duly filled self-declaration forms about those patients in their knowledge having a travel history of Covid-19 affected countries,” the REDCR says.
