Now, sanitisation tunnel in Valpoi to fight coronavirus
2020-04-10
VALPOI: Everyone wants to do their bit to defeat Covid-19. A Valpoi-based businessman has prepared a portable sanitisation tunnel that he believes can aid in the fight against the virus.

Made up of plastic net and pipe, the tunnel has micro sprinklers on top which sprays sanitiser liquid on all those who pass through. 

“You have to walk through the tunnel and the sanitiser liquid will sprinkle on the individual. Once that happens, whatever virus and bacteria is present on the body will be killed,” said Prasad Khadilkar, who built the tunnel.

Khadilkar struck upon the idea from agricultural farms where similar tunnels are used. His son Parag, a local panch, said such tunnels can be prepared in two days.

They have six in stock. One tunnel has already been donated to the Community Health Centre while another will be handed over to the Valpoi police station on Friday. “This sanitisation tunnel is portable and can be set up at entry, exit points of hospitals, offices, schools police stations and other places,” Khadilkar told TOI.
