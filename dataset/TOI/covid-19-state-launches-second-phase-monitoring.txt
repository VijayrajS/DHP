2020-03-04
Thiruvananthapuram: In the wake of more cases of Covid-19 being reported in the country and in more countries across the world, health minister K K Shailaja has said that the health department will launch the second phase of monitoring process in the state.

“Even though we have successfully controlled the cases in the first phase, our job is not fully over. Since the cases are being reported in more countries, the surveillance has to be strengthened here. Hence, it has been decided to operate the health desks in the airports round the clock,” said the health minister.

The isolation of those who had direct contacts with the positive patients and also those who are having symptoms of fever, sore throat and cold will continue. All the isolation wards set up in the government hospitals will continue. 

Since a few cases have been reported in other parts of the country, the Union health ministry has asked all the states to be more cautious. In a video conference the Union health secretary had with the secretaries of all the states, Kerala was showered with praise for the excellent surveillance it did when the first case was reported, she said.
