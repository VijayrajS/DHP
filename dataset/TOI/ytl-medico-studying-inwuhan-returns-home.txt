YAVATMAL: A girl from Maregaon tehsil in the district studying in a medical college in Wuhan in China has returned home hale and hearty.


The girl Snehal Chatki, a resident of Chichmandal village, is a second-year MBBS student in a private medical college in Wuhan province, the epicentre of novel coronavirus (Covid 19) outbreak.

Snehal along with others was allowed to leave the college campus in Wuhan on February 2. After they reached New Delhi, all the returnees were screened and shifted to Manesar-based ITBT camp where they were kept under observation. The returnees underwent some medical tests and after the results came negative for coronavirus infection, Snehal was allowed to go home.

Snehal’s father Moreshwar expressed his gratitude towards the government of India for extending all help to the students in returning home from the Covid-19-hit Wuhan.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra government has issued a red alert to all district administrations and accordingly Yavatmal collector M Devendra Singh has directed all private, government hospitals and the district health officer to take necessary precautions in the wake of coronavirus infection cases being reported in India. He has also sought cooperation of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in tackling the virus threat.

District civil surgeon Dr Tarang Tushar Ware said he is in touch with Chatki family and is monitoring Snehal’s health on a daily basis. An isolation ward has been set up at the GMCH to keep suspected Covid -19-infected persons, said dean Dr Milind Kamble.
