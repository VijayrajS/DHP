MLA hostel workers scared, expect quarantined flyers to keep rooms clean
2020-03-21
NAGPUR: Around 15 women, with their faces covered with masks, sat on a pavement in front of the MLA Hostel block where the quarantined flyers have been housed. They were waiting for permission to enter the block for cleaning work.


They are contractual workers deployed to clean the MLA Hostel buildings and rooms. As each of them slowly opened up on being questioned, they asked was it really necessary for them to go into the rooms. “Initially, they asked us to go just like that, but when we insisted for safety kits, they were finally provided,” said one of the women.

“Even with the protective gear, we are still scared of going inside. The rooms are not too big and can be cleaned up by the occupants themselves. However, they also leave the empty food packets just like that,” said one of them not wishing to be named.

“The empty food packets are left in the corridor. The occupants can put it in the dustbin. Instead they order us to clean it when we ask them to dispose it on their own,” said a worker. Other officials managing facility also agreed that at least the room can be cleaned by the occupants.

The workers said they are given Rs6,000 a month and have been promised extra for providing services to the quarantined flyers. Their supervisor quickly said that it was Rs7,000 while the contractor, Vicky Jain, claimed they are paid Rs12,000.

Jain said when he saw that doctors are going inside with protective gear, he insisted that his workers too should get the facility, which was provided. “My team used to earlier work in the Mayo Hospital and only the trained staff goes inside the rooms,” he said. 

“Once they come out of the room, facilities of washing their person and preventive gear has also been arranged. We ensure that the workers are safe,” he said.
