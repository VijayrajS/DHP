HARIDWAR: As many as 39 people, including several BJP functionaries and the councilor of Haridwar Municipal Corporation, were home quarantined as they all participated in a ration distribution event which was attended by a man who has now tested Covid-19 positive.

Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar told TOI, “After contract tracing, around 39 people were home quarantined by the health department. Other locals who participated in the event have also been asked to remain under isolation for the next 14 days. I have asked the health department to monitor all those who have been quarantined and take samples of people who display symptoms.”

The official added that the local administration has urged all social and religious outfits to take proper precaution and follow social distancing rules while distributing ration or other essentials.

The development has brought to the fore the risk associated with events where ration is distributed or Corona Warriors are felicitated as social distancing norms are hardly followed by participants during these ceremonies. In many such events, functionaries of political parties have also been seen taking selfies with health workers posted in hospitals dedicated for Covid-19 cases.
