2020-04-09
PANAJI: The state government has created ‘paid’ quarantine centres by tying up with some private hotels.


Speaking to mediapersons, Sawant said, “We already have government quarantine centres in place. However, if someone is interested in staying at a private quarantine centre, the government has created the facility. We have tied up with some hotels.”

Sawant said if people come to the state after the lockdown is lifted, the government will not allow them to stay at home. If they don’t want to stay at government quarantine centres, they can opt for private quarantined centres by paying the necessary fees, the chief minister said. 

“If somebody feels that the facilities at the government quarantine centres are not good enough, they can choose to stay at the paid quarantine centres,” Sawant said.
