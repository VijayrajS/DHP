Villagers in Goa fall back on local farm produce amid lockdown
2020-03-31
PANAJI/QUEPEM: With lack of essential commodities and poor access to groceries in the face of the ongoing nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid-19, villagers are turning to locally produced food for survival.


Most villagers continue to fetch items like onions, tomatoes and potatoes from grocery stores. Since vegetables like ladies’ fingers, cabbage and brinjal easily grow in Goa, their distribution is making small farmers unsung heroes for hungry Goans.

In some far-flung villages, small farmers move house to house selling their personal produce while those closer to towns are taking orders via WhatsApp, sources said.

“This lockdown hardly affects villagers as they are the main suppliers of agricultural produce,” John Fernandes, a lawyer from Ambaulim and an organic farmer, said. 

As most villagers in the Quepem taluka are agriculturists, they have enough food grains to last them for over a year. They also use raw mango as a pickle and use raw jackfruit in dishes. 

In Aldona, vegetables like cluster beans, brinjal, spinach and ivy gourd are available. “This is all freshly picked produce procured directly from the farmers. They’re even priced within the normal range,” said villager Nirmala Fernandes.

After state horticulture outlets downed shutters, Taleigao-based Vito Gomes had about 1,000kg of brinjals from his farm. These were distributed among buyers. 

A resident of Dona Paula said he and his neighbours have been able to source sweet potatoes and brinjals from a neighbour.

Nestor Rangel, who has an organic farm in St Estevam, has about 4,000kg of brown rice. He is awaiting his travel and distribution permit to start selling from his farm. “For now, I’m selling the rice from my home in St Cruz to whoever can travel till here. The prices have not been hiked. I don’t take cash and insist on an online transaction to ensure minimal interaction,” he said.
