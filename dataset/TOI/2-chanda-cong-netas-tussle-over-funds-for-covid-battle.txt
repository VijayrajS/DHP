2 Chanda Cong netas tussle over funds for Covid battle
2020-05-16
Chandrapur: Two Congress stalwarts — disaster management, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar and former MP Naresh Puglia — are at loggerheads over issuance of funds for the district to combat the novel coronavirus (Covid-19).

Wadettiwar, who is also district guardian minister, had recently claimed to have made provision of over Rs38 crore, highest for any district in Vidarbha, to curb the Covid-19 spread in Chandrapur.

He claimed that the funds have been roped in through disaster management, mining royalty fund and district planning and development committee. A sum of over Rs24 crore has been distributed among health agencies to strengthen facilities to fight the coronavirus pandemic so far, he had said.

Former MP Puglia has, however, termed the minister’s claims as eyewash and charged that so far only Rs2.50 crore grant has been received in the district to tackle the pandemic.

“If the administration had such a large fund at its disposal as claimed by the minister, then what was the need for the district collector to plead with divisional commissioner for additional funds of Rs4 crore,” said Puglia.

He also charged Wadettiwar with deceiving people and has dashed off a letter to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat urging him to intervene and make sure necessary grant is released for Chandrapur through mining royalty and other funds. 

Rebuffing Puglia’s charge, Wadettiwar camp said the minister’s claims are substantiated by documentary evidence.
