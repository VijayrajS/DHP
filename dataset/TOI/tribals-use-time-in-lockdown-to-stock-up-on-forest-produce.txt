2020-04-20
AMRABAD: While the lockdown has adversely impacted jobs and businesses of many, the tribals have found a way out to keep themselves engaged even during this period of distress.

The tribal population of Amrabad in Nallamala forest is utilising the excess time to collect forest produce such as Mahua (ippa) flowers, Tendu (beedi), Madipi ginjalu (seeds of Sal tree), Nannari root etc. They plan is to sell these popular products once the lockdown ends in May.

Speaking to TOI, Chigurla Mallikarjun, a resident of Sarlapally hamlet said, “Even though we cannot go out of the forest until the lockdown is lifted, the tribal communities here are keeping themselves busy by collecting Mahua, Nannari and other forest produce every day. These products can be sold either to the Gramina Co-operative Corporation (GCC) or in the open market once normalcy returns”. 

Another resident of the tribal community, Chenchu Lingaiah, said they are not affected much by the lockdown. “Even otherwise we do not have much to do after the lockdown. Every year during this period we usually collect minor forest produce. Even now we are are doing the same, collecting Mahua, Nannari and other products,” Lingaiah said. 

When asked about social distancing, Lingaiah said, “Each hamlet is located at a distance of two kilometers from each other, so people cannot comein contact with each other. Also, there are no weekly gatherings.”
