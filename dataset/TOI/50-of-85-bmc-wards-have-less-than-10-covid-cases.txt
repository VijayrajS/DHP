Bhopal: As many as 50 of the 85 Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) wards have reported less than 10 Covid-19 cases. The state capital has reported over 1,300 cases since the beginning of the outbreak. 

This effectively means that only 15% of cases have been reported from 60% of the BMC wards. “There has been a lot of proactive measures which have been taken at the ward and zonal level which lead to checking the spread of infection. Containment zones are working and we expect more support from the people to contain Covid-19,” said a BMC commissioner, B Vijay Datta. “Hand washing practice is the best solution,” he added.

According to the report of ward-wise infection in the state capital, five new wards have been highlighted where a new spread is being indicated. Itwara, Jumerati-Lakherapura, Barkedi (Jehangirbad), Barkheda (BHEL), Chandbadh and Bagh Dilkhusha have reported 70% of the Covid-19 cases in the last two weeks.

The trend also reflects an increase in the number of cases in the last two weeks. It indicates that containment efforts are in the right direction and reinforces the fact that scaling up of testing and social distancing should continue, said an official.

Among children, both boys and girls are equally affected. In ages between 20 and 70 years, males are more affected than females. This indicates more mobility in males than females.

As anticipated, spread of cases will more likely to happen in adjacent areas. Containment activities, including perimeter control, need to be enhanced in similar fashion, the civic chief added.

Most of the deaths took place in those above the age of 50 years and was significantly more in those above 70 years of age. Intensive surveillance of the elderly is vital. Also, as suggested in MHA, GoI guidelines, it should be ensured that those above 65 years of age must stay indoors unless there is some medical emergency.
