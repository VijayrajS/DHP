Sambalpur: While people are preferring at stay home to keep themselves safe, a nine-month pregnant sub-inspector is doing her duty. 

Director general of police (DGP) Abhaya, who visited Sambalpur on April 30, lauded sub-inspector Teresa Xess for her dedication in his twitter handle.

Teresa is posted at the Town police station in Sambalur city. Though senior officers asked her to stay home on leave, she denied. “I saw everybody doing their bit for humanity during this period of crisis. Hence, I decided not to take leave. I am absolutely fine and I am able to do my work properly. Moreover, it is also giving me satisfaction that I am a part of the combat against the invisible enemy,” she said.

Considering Teresa’s willingness to perform duty and her health condition, the district police have not assigned her any outdoor duty. “The other police personnel are going outside to enforce lockdown and perform other duties nowadays, and at this time, I am doing my duty at the police station,” said Teresa. 

Teresa said, “I am happy as the DGP spoke to me when he came to Sambalpur. He spoke to me like the head of the family. It was encouraging and morale booster for me. The DGP inquired about my health condition,” she said.
