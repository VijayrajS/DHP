Govt mulls providing option of free or paid quarantine
2020-03-19
Ahmedabad: Health department officials in Gujarat on Wednesday hinted that those returning from abroad can get a choice of quarantine, the AMC-designated quarantine facilities for free, or checking into a hotel for 14 days.According to directives of the central government, all persons returning from abroad, especially those from countries with a COVID-19 outbreak and those showing symptoms such as cough/cold, fever or respiratory illness, will be quarantined. This will also apply to those older than 60 years and having other health conditions such as asthma, blood pressure or diabetes.“We are creating quarantine facilities in Ahmedabad in association with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The quarantine there will be free including meals and basic amenities. However, for those wanting to pay for better facilities, we are in talks with a few hotels to provide an entire floor for the purpose. These persons will get a discounted tariff. We are still working out the finer details,” said a senior state health department official.AMC officials said that the two quarantine facilities in question are the new Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana housing units in Nikol and Gujarat Sports Club near Sardar Patel Stadium. AMC teams were seen shifting medical equipment and beds to both locations.While the transition for the club house was smooth, with the identification of various zones and utilities, the 100-bed facility did not go down well with Nikol residents, who protested citing the health hazards.“We are yet to get a satisfactory answer from the AMC on what measures they taken to ensure the safety of residents and what type of patients will be kept here,” says Jitendra Vyas, a resident of Jivanashray Society in Nikol. The AMC will add three more such centres, including the sports complex in eastern Ahmedabad, if needed, senior AMC officials said.
