HYDERABAD: The number of containment clusters in the city might increase depending upon the number of coronavirus cases. The restrictions in the existing clusters will continue for 14 days. 

“As of now we have marked 12 areas in the city. Some test results are yet to come out. Areas will be covered based on the reports. People need not panic, the activities are being taken up for benefit of people,” said chief secretary Somesh Kumar while inspecting one of the clusters. “Roughly 12 to 15 areas have been identified and number can go up,” said city police commissioner Anjani Kumar. 

Containments behind Khairtabad and the area around Mallepally Badi Masjid, Nampally were inspected by line department. One containment zone has been marked for a population of around 4,000 to 7,000 people. Roads and buildings department have provided barricading at entry and exit points in these clusters. GHMC and line departments have been entrusted with the task of ensuring essential supplies reach the households in the clusters. Verification revealed people in some clusters were using bylanes to escape the barricading. 

Only some parts of clusters were barricaded and activity will continue on Friday too. 

The sports complexes and GHMC community halls in these areas are being used by multi-disciplinary teams to roll out the day’s action plan. 

Officials went around the localities in vehicles and made announcements asking people to stay indoors. Door-to-door surveys to check people for coronavirus symptoms have begun in these areas.
