AGRA: Health department teams, as a precautionary measure against Covid-19, sanitized two convent schools in Agra. Both the schools, St Peter’s College and St Felix Nursery School, remained closed on Wednesday. Chief medical officer (VCMO) Mukesh Kumar Vats conducted an inspection at these schools to ensure proper sanitization.

According to sources, children of several shoe exporters, who recently visited Italy and other foreign countries, are studying in these schools. Health department is monitoring the health of half a dozen students and their family members.

Principal of St Peter’s College Father Andrew Correia said, “School was closed on Wednesday as a preventive measure. Under the supervision of health department officials, sanitization of the entire school premises was done. There is nothing to worry about. We are making the best possible arrangements for the well being of our students. The school will function as usual from Thursday onwards.”

“I have issued orders to place an advisory in all classrooms to avoid coronavirus infection. We have also planned to update parents on the dos and dont’s to prevent the spread of this deadly disease,” he added. 

Talking to TOI, CMO Vats said, “St Peter’s college and its junior wing St Felix have been sanitized by mopping of sodium hypochlorite. Parents need not panic. They should send their children to school without any fear. We have asked school authorities to guide students about the coronavirus infection.”
