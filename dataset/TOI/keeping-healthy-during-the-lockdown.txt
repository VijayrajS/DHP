Keeping healthy during the lockdown
2020-04-15
Ahmedabad: With increasing restrictions during the ongoing lockdown on movement of people, even those who are out for a morning walk, keeping up with regular workout is a challenge for many. Those who are accustomed to morning walks, especially diabetics – who have been asked by medical practitioners to walk daily, are often in a fix on how to maintain their daily schedule intact.

Physiotherapy experts say that staying active and practising simple exercises and yoga will help maintain a regular workout routine while indoors. 

“The idea is to exercise all your muscles and stay active. Suryanamaskar is one of the best forms of exercises that keeps you fit. That apart, if you are well-versed with yoga postures, you can practise some at home,” said Dr Hiral Bhatt, who is a senior physiotherapist at a city-based private hospital.

“It is a misconception that walking is the only form of exercise. There are various other forms of exercises that one can do to improve core strength, or simply remaining active helps a lot. However, due care and caution must be observed if you have any ailments and it is best to consult your doctor before opting for something new,” Dr Maharshi Bhatt, senior orthopaedic & joint replacement surgeon.
