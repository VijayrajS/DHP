On Saturday, the report concluded that the constable was positive for coronavirus. Immediately, the officials started identifying his primary contacts and directed his wife and two children to go to state-run quarantine. Similarly, a sub-inspector and five constables were also sent to quarantine since the constable was in touch with them while performing duties. 

Police suspect the constable might have got infected while performing duties at a check post.
