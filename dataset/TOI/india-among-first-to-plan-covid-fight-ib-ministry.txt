NEW DELHI: In its 92-page e-booklet highlighting its key achievements, the ministry of information and broadcasting has said India is among the first few countries to have put in place a “comprehensive action plan” to contain the spread of coronavirus.


Listing the achievements of the Modi government in its second term in office, the e-book titled ‘‘One Year of Modi 2.0 — Towards A Self-Reliant India’‘, says: “Even as social distancing and change of lifestyles became a new normal, India under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi is one of the first countries to put up a concerted, comprehensive action plan to stop the spread of the virus and limit the number of infections.”

The e-book says India made every effort to turn the crisis into an opportunity. “It went into a mode of selfreliance and sprung into action to become ‘‘Aatmanirbhar’‘. International organisations like the WHO have praised the efforts by the Indian government to fight the pandemic, it said, adding that India is among the few countries to announce a complete lockdown when the number of cases were less than 500.

“When the Corona crisis started, there was not a single PPE kit made in India. The N-95 masks were produced in small quantities in India. Today we are in a position to produce 2 lakh PPE and 2 lakh N-95 masks daily,” the book’s introduction says.

It also boasts of the government’s flagship Make in India as a success story citing Swadeshi Swab Sticks. “As the global supply chains suffered and in order to scale up the testing capabilities in the country, India geared up to produce high quality, low cost testing swabs...This was achieved under the ‘Make in India’ initiative in record seven days,” the e-book said
