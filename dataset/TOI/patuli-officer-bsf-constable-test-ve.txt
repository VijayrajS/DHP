KOLKATA: A BSF constable posted at the CPC canteen tested positive on Sunday. Six of his colleagues, however, have now recovered and have been released from hospital. An officer at Patuli police station also tested positive. His wife, who is in Kolkata Police as well, had earlier been detected with Covid, but is now free of it. The Maniktala barracks of Kolkata Police have now been added to the list of containment zones. Additionally, at least two men from the Howrah police barracks have reported Covid-like symptoms. 

With 42 CISF personnel testing positive earlier, the state has so far reported 95 positive cases among cops and central security forces.

Police sources said since cases were still spiking, a standard SOP has been initiated as a containment policy. 

“At least 34 officers of Jorabagan traffic guard were tested after the the place was turned into a containment zone. But certain officers, like those from special branch, do not stay at one spot. They work across the city. We have asked the seniors to monitor the health of each of our personnel. Anyone complaining of any Covid-like symptom is being tested. At the police stations, we are arranging for random tests,” said a joint CP at Lalbazar.
