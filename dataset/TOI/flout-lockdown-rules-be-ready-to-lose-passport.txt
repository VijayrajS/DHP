2020-04-04
VADODARA: Planning a foreign trip later this year? Then, beware before venturing out during lockdown.

Vadodara police have decided to press for revoking the passports of those flouting lockdown rules. Police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut said beginning Friday (April 3), city police will make a list of all those arrested for violating public notification and find out who all possess passports. “Once identified, we will write to the passport office and ministry of home affairs to cancel their passports,” he said.

Gahlaut added that those who don’t have passports also won’t be spared. “There would be many who want to apply for passport. We will mention the police complaint and arrest on record during police clearance for passports.”

The decision about this drastic step was taken as people are still seen sauntering on the roads and other public areas without any reason. Many are giving ridiculous excuses for moving out of their homes.

On Friday, 35 people were booked for violating the lockdown orders and police will start the process to check who among them are passport holders.

“With the help of CCTVs and drone cameras, we are capturing images of people who are moving outdoors. When they are tracked down and questioned, many of them are found to be moving out in public areas without any valid reason. People are not taking lockdown seriously,” Gahlaut said.

“The move to restrict their overseas travel is aimed at curbing unnecessary commuting by citizens,” Gahlaut told TOI.

People from those from well-to-do families were also found moving around in cars for no reason, compelling the cops to step up their drive to detain vehicles of offenders over last few days.

Sources in the police department said the advisory to cancel passports has been given to all police stations across the state.
