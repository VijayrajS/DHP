PUNE: The Pune municipal areas added the latest 1,000 Covid-19 cases in just six days, the least so far, taking the total patient tally above 4,000.

It took over 45 days for the first 1,000 cases to emerge in the PMC limits, while the second 1,000 cases were added in 11 days and the third 1,000 in just nine days.



Data from the PMC’s health department shows that positive cases have been on the rise in the municipal limits since the last three weeks, which has mostly been attributed to increased sample collection of suspected patients. Health officials said the rise was also due to rigorous surveillance and contact tracing. 

PMC data shows that the daily case burden was around 100 at the beginning of the month and it surged beyond 150 in the last few days. 

On May 21, positive cases in the municipal limits reached 4,154, with highest single-day addition of 222 cases. In the last one week, the daily case load was more than 200 on two days, while it was above 150 on other two days. The daily average of new positive cases during the last six days has been around 174. 

“The focus of the administration was more on tracing high- and low-risk contacts and getting them tested. The first contacts of positive cases are crucial to decide the line of action. Our teams are doing it rigorously for the last few days. We have also told them to pay attention to the citizens aged above 60 with co-morbidities like diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney-related ailments and respiratory problems,” a civic official said. 

The PMC has introduced over 10 mobile medical vans to collect swab samples of the residents of the containment areas. The teams attached to the vans are also checking body temperature and blood oxygen of vulnerable groups.
