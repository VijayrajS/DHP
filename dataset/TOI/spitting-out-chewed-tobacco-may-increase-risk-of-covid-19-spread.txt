VISAKHAPATNAM: Apart from the well-known harms of tobacco consumption, doctors and health experts now say that tobacco consumption could lead to the spread of Covid-19. Since the virus spreads through saliva, among other droplets, people spitting out chewed tobacco on the road could prove dangerous.

Further, smokers are more at risk of getting very sick if they get Covid-19 since their lungs and respiratory systems have suffered long-term damage. This May 31, on World No-Tobacco Day, health experts opine that spitting of tobacco in public places should stop immediately and heavy fines should be imposed on those violating the rule.

Dr KS Phaneendra Kumar, consultant pulmonologist at Kims Icon Hospital, said, “Smokers are more prone to develop serious Covid-19-related complications. Besides causing cancer, smoking hampers blood circulation and lung function, increase carbon monoxide levels in blood, escalate risk of heart disease, hypertension and stroke.” “When a smoker with any of these comorbidities gets infected by the novel coronavirus, the risk to life of these patients goes up,” he added. Dr Kumar informed that in India, nearly 120 million adult males are active tobacco addicts. Of these, nearly 70 per cent consume smokeless tobacco.

Dr Murali Krishna Voonna, chief surgical oncologist and MD of Mahatma Gandhi Cancer Hospital and Research Institute said, “Tobacco users are prone to spitting after consuming chewing tobacco . The spit contains saliva and the novel coronavirus can spread easily through saliva.”
