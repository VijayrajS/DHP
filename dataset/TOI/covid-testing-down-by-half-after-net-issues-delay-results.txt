2020-05-22
KOLKATA: Covid sample testing dropped by nearly half on Thursday as disrupted internet connections delayed result generation. On Thursday, 4,242 samples were tested. 




“Covid result generation has been massively affected due to the snapping of internet connection. And the results that were already generated before the cyclone are yet to be sent across to the hospitals,” said an official at NRS Medical College and Hospital.

Laboratories that had generated Covid reports prior to the cyclone could not send the results across to the hospitals either. Transporting samples from hospitals to the laboratories has also been affected as major thoroughfares remained out of bounds for traffic. 

Hospitals have also been hit by manpower issues, specially Group-D employees. 

“We already had a Group-D manpower crisis. Now, even maintaining cleanliness in the wards is a challenge,” said an official at Medical College and Hospital. Kolkata. 

At SSKM Hospital, the area around the main block remained flooded till Thursday afternoon. The roof of the main MBBS hostel had also come down. However, no one was injured.
