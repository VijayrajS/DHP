New Delhi: A doctor returning from his duty at a corona screening centre in south Delhi was killed after a car hit the bicycle he was riding on Monday evening.

A senior corporation official told TOI that Dr JP Yadav was returning home from Munirka polyclinic on his son’s bicycle as he could not get his car repaired because of the ongoing lockdown.

The deceased doctor’s wife is a radiologist in a private hospital and he is survived by a son and a daughter. “After increase in corona cases in the capital, the clinic has been turned into a Covid-19 screening centre. Dr Yadav was heading this centre,” said a senior doctor.

“On Monday, he was returning home after distributing personal protective equipment kits at the clinic,” Dr Yadav’s colleague added.

When Dr Yadav was returning home in Greater Kailash around 3 pm, a car hit him from behind near Merauli’s Aurobindo Road at PTS Chowk. “A PCR van took the doctor to Max hospital where he was declared dead,” his colleague said.

A senior police officer said that it is a case of hit-and- run as of now and efforts are being made to track down the car driver.
