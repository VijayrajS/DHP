HYDERABAD: Even as most corporate offices are encouraging people to work from home, employees of pharma companies and hospitals rue that they do not have such facilities.

While hospitals are taking extra precaution with sanitisation and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), most medical representatives are still doing rounds of multiple hospitals and clinics each day and in the process endangering many lives.

“Several pharma executives are still working because firms have not given any holiday to them. They are the ones who visit several hospitals everyday and this is dangerous to their health,” tweeted Shaik Naseer Ahmed, a medical business associate from the city. 

Apart from the possibility of contracting the virus, medical representatives also run a risk of spreading it to healthcare staff as they go around 10-12 hospitals each day. “I have been to atleast 10 hospitals each day in the last one month and this is the case with most medical representatives as firms want to make the most of the current crisis. Since a variety of drugs are available for most health issues and patients have to be given symptomatic treatment only, managements insist that we are aggressive in our approach,” said another executive from a pharma company.
