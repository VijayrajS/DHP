2020-03-11
PUNE: The Southern Command has established two isolation wards for screening and providing emergency medical care to suspected coronavirus patients. 


The facilities have been created at the Military Hospital Khadki and Military Hospital-Cardio Thoracic Centre. “The move has been taken after issuing a series of directives from the Army headquarters a few days ago in the wake of rising cases of coronavirus in the country. The isolation wards will be utilized for screening of symptomatic cases to prevent transmission. The hospitals will work in tandem with local medical authorities and the designated Indian Council of Medical Research laboratories,” a senior Army officer, who did not wish to be named, told TOI on Tuesday. 

Moreover, regular health education and counselling activities are being carried out at all military stations.“We have told our personnel to utilize the shopping complex facilities within the stations and cantonments as precautionary measures. They have been told to avoid crowded areas like shopping malls and movie halls,” the officer said.
