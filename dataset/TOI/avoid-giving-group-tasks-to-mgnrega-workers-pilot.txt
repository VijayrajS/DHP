The collectors have been directed to publish the “do’s and don’ts” in bullet points on the backside of the receipts issued to the workers on submission of Form 6 (for demanding work under MGNREGA). 

“The mates should create awareness among workers about the precautionary measures regarding coronavirus. Every work site should have a medical kit, soaps for handwashing, sufficient drinking water,” read the advisory. 

Pilot also said in the order to ensure prevention of the spread of coronavirus infection, the collectors must educate the workers about necessary precautions like washing their hands frequently, covering their face while coughing and sneezing. 

The advisory also directed that they should keep distance from people suffering from cold and cough at work site, wash hands with soap frequently and not to touch their nose, eyes and mouth repeatedly. 

It also stated one should seek medical advice if the worker is suffering from cold, cough, running nose and fever.
