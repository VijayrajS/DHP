“We are holding cargo ships that have come to JNPT from Covid-19-affected countries away from the inner anchorage while the crew on ships from other countries are being dissuaded from landing, except for Indian officers, provided they do not have high body temperature or show any other symptoms,” said an JNPT official.

According to port officials, their medical teams will allow the Iranian ship to berth only if data of the cargo on it, body temperatures of the crew and declarations submitted by its authorities are found to match the standards laid down by the central health ministry.

It may be mentioned that thermal scanners have been put up at the embarkation and disembarkation points, besides health staff have been deployed to cross-verify and certify these.

“If we find anyone infected with the virus, we have ambulances and other setup in place to take patients to Kasturba Hospital at Chinchpokli,” an official added.

For disembarkation, health officers have to certify the crew as per health department procedures, said an MbPT official, adding ships importing oil at Jawahar Dweep and other cargo ships were being allowed to operate but only after checks by medical teams. Sources said unlike at airports, no steps are being taken to check surveyors, agents, clients and barge personnel who enter vessels without checking health of crew.
