HYDERABAD/LUCKNOW: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday suggested that the nationwide lockdown should be extended for a couple of weeks to contain the spread of coronavirus.

He has sent his suggestion to PM Narendra Modi even as Uttar Pradesh hinted that the lockdown could be extended. “In the past few days, the number of cases in UP has gone up because of Tablighi Jamaat attendees, who are more than half the total cases in the state. It would be premature to presume at this point that lockdown will be lifted on April 14,” said UP’s additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi.

KCR suggested the curbs should be lifted after June 3. “To the best of my knowledge and experience, a lockdown is the only weapon to contain the spread of coronavirus cases in the country. It should continue for the next one or two weeks to deal with the situation,” he told reporters. Referring to a report by Boston Consulting Group, he said for countries like India, lockdown was the only mantra to deal with the pandemic.
