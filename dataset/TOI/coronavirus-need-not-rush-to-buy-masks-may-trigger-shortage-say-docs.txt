Coronavirus: Need not rush to buy masks, may trigger shortage, say doctors
2020-02-04
PANAJI: The demand for face masks in view of the coronavirus outbreak in China has increased, but they are mostly bought by tourists rather than locals. The specialised N- 95 masks are not available.

Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, state epidemiologist, said people don’t need to use specialised masks. They can do with a three-layered mask if necessary. It costs relatively less and is a one-time use mask that should be replaced after six hours of use, he said.

Kedar Jirage, proprietor and chief pharmacist at Jeevan Rekha medical stores in Panaji, said they sell about 30 to 35 masks a day. “They are bought by mostly travelers,” he said. He said his pharmacy had received an order for supply of 100-150 masks, but they could not fulfill it. The person who placed the order, he said, wanted to send them to China. 

Raj Vaidya, chief pharmacist at Panaji’s Hindu Pharmacy, said they too have sold more masks since the new disease surfaced. 

Betodkar, however, warned people not to buy masks unnecessarily, particularly the specialised kind, to avoid the shortage of masks.

 “Correct disposal of masks is very important,” he said, further adding that specialised masks are for use by doctors and health workers who are exposed to the infection. Goa has two cases of suspected Coronavirus isolated at Goa Medical College ,and hospital, while 14 persons are under observation. The blood and nasal swab samples of one patient was sent for testing at Pune's National Institute of Virology (NIV). The report of the other patient, a foreigner is awaited.
