Coronavirus outbreak: Sensex loses 581 pts, ends at 39-mth low
2020-03-20
MUMBAI: Thursday was another day of volatile trades on Dalal Street with the sensex see-sawing over 2,600 points, but again closing deep in the red. Banking & financials, along with Reliance, weighed on the benchmark index as, globally, the coronavirus case count rose and more economists saw a bigger chance of an economic recession over the next few quarters. 


The day’s session was also impacted down by the weakness of the rupee that breached the psychologically important 75-to-the-dollar mark as foreign funds continued to sell.

The sensex opened deep in the red and slipped below the 27k mark to a 40-month low in early trade. But then, it rallied nearly 10%, or 2,657 points, to an intra-day high at 29,371. But in late selling, the sensex gave up all gains to close 581 points, or 2%, lower at 28,288 — a 39-month closing low. 

On the NSE, the Nifty closed 205 points or 2.4% off at 8,263. India VIX, the volatility index that is also considered to be a measure of fear among market players, jumped 12.5% to 72 — its highest level in over a decade.

According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, Indian markets continued to slide southward as the number of coronavirus cases in India as well as globally rose. Although several governments, central banks and regulators have announced steps to support the economy and the businesses, these have not been too successful. 

“With rising cases of coronavirus, volatility is likely to continue in coming days and any bounce could be sold into. In such times, traders should refrain taking long positions as all the global markets are in a strong bear grip,” he said.

End of the session data on the BSE showed that foreign investors were net sellers at Rs 4,623 crore on Thursday, taking the total outflow for the month from stocks alone to over Rs 55,000 crore, or about $7.5 billion. So far in the month, over 1,200 of the BSE stocks have hit the 52-week low level, including sensex heavyweights like RIL, TCS, ITC, HDFC Bank and HDFC.

Market players said that for D-Street investors, Friday could bring some respite since, in early trades on Wall Street, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 indices were holding on to their previous closing levels and showing a steady trend.
