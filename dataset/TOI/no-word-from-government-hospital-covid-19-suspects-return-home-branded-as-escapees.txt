Meerut: A government hospital in Meerut witnessed a series of dramatic events beginning Tuesday night when its authorities claimed that nine persons who were to be quarantined have fled. The suspense ended on Wednesday afternoon when police traced most of them and slammed the hospital for mismanagement.Police found one of them in the hospital, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College (LLRM), and another had reached Subharti medical college to be quarantined. Six others had returned to their homes after waiting for hours for a word from the hospital, or an ambulance to take them to quarantine facility. All the nine persons, who tested negative, were to be shifted to Subharti Medical College.Meerut SP (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said, “We got to know about the incident at 12:30AM on Wednesday, despite the fact that the nine persons had gone missing at around 9pm, a day earlier. There was a delay in informing us about the matter. Even then, when we reached LLRM Medical College and launched a man-hunt, one was found at the hospital, one was at Subharti Medical College and six others had returned home only because no communication was made by the hospital about what to do next.” Police said that one person is yet to be traced.The patients said that as no ambulance arrived for hours they were not left with no option but to return home.Meanwhile, the hospital authorities had a different version to offer.“The nine persons were suspects and had tested negative. They were discharged and had to be sent to the quarantine facility at Subharti Medical College. May be the ambulance got delayed… while some boarded it, others returned home in the presence of guards and policemen who did not stop them for fear of getting infected by touching them. However, it is a matter of investigation. All of them have returned so there is not much to worry about,” said Dr RC Gupta, principal, LLRM Medical College.
