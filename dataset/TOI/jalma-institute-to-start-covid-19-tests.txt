AGRA: After Agra’s SN Medical College (SNMC), now the Japanese Leprosy Mission for Asia (Jalma) institute in the city is going to start testing suspects for Covid-19. The national institute for leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases is a wing of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Following an increase in the number of novel coronavirus cases, the state government had proposed the ICMR to start the Covid-19 testing facility at the centre. Other than this, the state government has also asked the SNMC administration to increase the sample testing capacity to at least 100 per day.

District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “The Jalma institute will start Covid-19 testing facility on Tuesday. A team of doctors from the institute have completed the required training to run the testing facility. Soon, we will be able to get 300 samples tested in Agra in a day. The microbiology lab at SNMC will be testing 100 samples. The Jalma institute will be testing 200 samples”.

Jalma institute director Shripad A. Patil said, “Following orders from ICMR, a team of doctors have completed the training at the national institute of biologicals (Noida) and national institute of malaria research in Delhi to conduct testing of novel coronavirus samples. We have ordered a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) machine from Germany. The machine will be delivered on Sunday. The testing of Covid-19 will be done at the biological safety level 3 lab in the institute. The operations will start on Tuesday.”
