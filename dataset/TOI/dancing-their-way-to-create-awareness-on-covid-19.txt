Coimbatore: Students of a city college have come up with a classical dance performance to create awareness on safety measures to keep the novel coronavirus away.Members of Natiyanjali, a dance team under the fine arts club of Hindusthan College of Arts and Science in the city, have ideated, performed and produced the dance video, which they have shared on YouTube and other social media platforms.Vanitha Praveenkumar, an assistant professor at the college’s department of computer technology, said they have been discussing ways to use bharatanatyam to spread an awareness message since the lockdown. She is also the coordinator of the college’s fine arts club.“We saw many Covid-19 awareness events that were held across the country and decided to record a bharatanatyam performance to create awareness. The team members discussed and came up with the idea of representing the safety measures that were advised by the state through the dance,” she said.The dance, performed by eight students of the Natiyanjali team, uses mudras and gestures to convey the importance of wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining physical distancing. In the background is a Telugu song which speaks of the huge impact of the disease, which the humanity would hopefully defeat and emerge victorious. “We listened to a bunch of songs on the theme and chose this one as it was suitable for our performance,” Vanitha said.The team members, who are at their houses now, recorded their portions, which were later edited into the video. As the members were trained Bharatanatyam dancers, they choreographed and executed the performance themselves.The team comprised choreographer G Sona, Sree Lakshmi, T Poorani, Priya Darsini, J Celin Joys, H Gayathri, B C Nagaveni and B Priyanka, all students of the college.
