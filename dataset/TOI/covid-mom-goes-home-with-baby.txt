On May 1, she gave birth to a baby boy. “Thankfully, the baby also tested negative for the infection, said senior gynaecologist of hospital, Dr Nehal Patel.

“Since the mother was infected, we were not bringing the baby close to her. . We were elated when she tested negative and was discharged from the hospital,” Dr Patel added.

Talking to TOI, Jatin said, “She had no symptoms of the virus. But she may have got infected from the hospital where she is working as nurse. I am relieved that she has recovered and our child will get proper nourishment of mother’s milk.”
