JAIPUR: Four persons including a 39-year-old Chinese woman have tested negative for novel coronavirus (nCoV). All the four were quarantined at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital. 

Following the virus scare, the state government has introduced a facility for nCoV diagnostic testing at the SMS Hospital. The facility is helping doctors in getting test reports in a day. 

Earlier, the health department had to send samples of suspected nCoV cases to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. All the six persons who had been quarantined at the hospital have tested negative for the disease. 

The health department has sought help from collectors to identify people who had travelled to China and returned recently. A similar letter has also been sent to the DGP to seek police help to identify Chinese tourists staying in hotels.

Arrangements have been made at Alwar's ESIC Medical College for keeping nearly 300 Indian citizens airlifted from China's Wuhan city, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. 

The batch of passengers has not yet arrived and is likely to arrive on Monday, said Ravi Sharma, a state health department official coordinating with the Centre.
