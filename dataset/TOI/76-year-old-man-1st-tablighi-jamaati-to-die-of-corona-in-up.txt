BAREILLY: A 76-year-old Tamil Nadu man, Mohammad Nuh, became the first Tablighi Jamaati to die due to Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday night. This was the second Covid-19 death within 24 hours in Moradabad and 12th in UP. Mohammad Nuh was shifted from the neighbouring Sambhal district to a Moradabad facility where he was undergoing treatment.


According to sources in the administration, Nuh had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi in mid-March. After participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz, Nuh went to Sambhal, where he and 10 other Jamaatis were found in Saraitareen locality under the jurisdiction of Hayatnagar police station. Of the 11 jamaatis found in Sambhal, eight have been tested positive for Covid-19.

After his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to a facility in Moradabad on April 9 where he breathed his last late on Tuesday night. His test report, which had arrived on Monday, confirmed he was Covid-19 positive.

This was the second such death since the first coronavirus casualty took place on Monday night, when a 49-year-old resident of Nawabpura locality succumbed to the virus. 

Meanwhile, 17 people (15 of them are Tablighi Jamaatis) have tested positive for Covid-19 in the district so far. 

Yamuna Prasad, superintendent of police of Sambal district, said that 11 Tablighi Jamaatis -- all hailing from Tamil Nadu -- had arrived on March 31 and were staying at Saraitareen locality. “All of them were taken to a quarantine centre and their samples were sent for testing at Aligarh and Lucknow labs. Eight of them tested positive for the virus. On Tuesday, one of them, Mohammad Nuh, was shifted to Moradabad after his health condition deteriorated. He died during treatment later in the day,” said Prasad. 

Chief medical officer of Moradabad said, “Bodies of Covid-19 infected persons are being disposed of according to the guidelines issued by the government.”
