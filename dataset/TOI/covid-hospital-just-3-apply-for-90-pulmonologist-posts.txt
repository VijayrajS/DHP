2020-04-09
Ahmedabad: At the time of this novel coronavirus pandemic, Civil Hospital authorities received just received three applications for the 90 vacancies for pulmonologist vacancies at its new Covid-19 hospital. Similarly, only 20 doctors applied for 165 posts of medical officers and just 150 applied for 700 posts of staff nurse, said a source in the Asarwa Civil Hospital where the new Covid-19 hospital has been set up. Hospital authorities through the district collector had on April 1 invited applications for 90 posts of pulmonologists offering a monthly salary of Rs 1.20 lakh, five posts of anaesthetists at Rs 1.20 lakh per month, 165 posts of medical officers (MBBS) for Rs 60,000 a month and 700 staff nurse posts for a monthly salary of Rs 13,000.The recruitment procedure was held at the 1,200-bed Covid-19 hospital on the Civil Hospital campus which was set up on April 3.Many candidates for the paramedical posts said the hospital was offering to meagre a salary of Rs 13,000 and this was the reason for the low turnout. A city-based doctor said that Rs 1.20 lakh monthly salary for a pulmonologist on a three month contract is also an indecent proposal. Any doctor or paramedical worker working with Covid-19 patients will definitely need better remuneration, he said.Sources in the hospital said the poor response will force authorities to hold another recruitment drive.Superintendent of Civil Hospital, Dr Gunwant Rathod, said that the government would take decision on holding the recruitment drive again. Last month, when the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) held a recruitment drive for 354 doctors for urban health centres, only 94 doctors had applied.
