DYFI demands free Covid-19 test in private labs for poor
2020-05-25
MANGALURU: Democratic Youth Federation of India has urged the government to conduct Covid-19 testing free of cost for the poor in private labs too. The government should ensure that the introduction of more laboratories in private medical colleges should not lead to commercialisation of testing, said Muneer Katipalla, state president, DYFI.

“Private labs are charging Rs 3,800 for each test. They also insist on admission of patients and other tests, which increases the burden of the common man. At a time when Covid-19 is spreading fast in Karnataka, the government should make tests free for the poor in all laboratories. Many people may voluntarily want to get their swab tests done to make sure that they are safe. However, the present rate is not affordable to them,” Muneer told TOI. 

When contacted, district health officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy said private laboratories are bound to collect charges as per the price fixed by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). 

“At present, the price fixed by the NPPA for each test is Rs 2,250. The district administration also pays the same amount for each test conducted in the private lab when samples are sent from Wenlock Hospital. However, private labs may be charging more because they use their vacutainer tubes to collect swabs. We send throat swabs collected in vacutainers supplied by the government and only tests are conducted in private lab. The government also supplies PPE kits to all designated Covid-19 hospitals. When people go directly to private labs, they may be including the charges for vacutainers and PPEs,” Dr Bairy said.
