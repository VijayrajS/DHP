Goa: Private doctors must report Covid-19, H1N1 cases to govt
2020-03-18
PANAJI: The Goa government on Tuesday framed new rules mandating that doctors and hospitals must report all Covid-19 and H1N1 (swine flu) cases to the directorate of health services. The government identified them as notifiable diseases under the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985.


Last week, the government invoked the Epidemic Act, 1897, to better combat the Covid-19. A health official said that not all private practitioners notify cases treated by them, and so, it does not give them a correct picture of diseases.
