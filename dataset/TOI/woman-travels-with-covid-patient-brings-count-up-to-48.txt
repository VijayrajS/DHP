PANAJI: Goa’s tally of active Covid-19 cases touched 48 on Monday after a female traveller tested positive. Of the confirmed 67 cases, 19 patients have been cured.


“The visitor had travelled along with a positive person two days ago in a bus. They were together. We were keeping a watch on the person,” said health secretary Nila Mohanan at a regular press briefing.

She said out of 361 samples sent for testing, 238 tested negative while 122 reports were awaited. Two persons were admitted to the isolation ward, 183 interstate travellers were placed in home quarantine and 189 travellers under facility quarantine.

Regarding the state’s preparedness in handling the influx of people as neighbouring states have reported a large number of coronavirus cases, she said, “We have to handle the situation as it is. This is an evolving situation. Every day it is changing. As and when the situation presents, we will add up to that. We have to be prepared,” she said.

More than 400 seafarers are expected to arrive in the next two weeks. The health department is more than prepared to test them all. 

Mohanan said that of the 417 seafarers who arrived in Goa last week, only a group who came in last are yet to be tested. The rest have tested negative and are doing fine, she said. 

She said since the seafarers had already undergone quarantine onboard a vessel, they are not immediately tested for Covid-19 on arrival. “They are tested four or five days later,” Mohanan said.

As per the revised Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) guidelines applicable to Indians coming from abroad, she said they will have to undergo seven days of institutional quarantine and the next seven days in home quarantine. “The same protocol will be applied to seafarers as well,” she said replying to a query.

As per the old protocol, 14 days of institutional quarantine was mandatory for seafarers and other international travellers.
