SECUNDERABAD: Residents of Laxminagar in Picket heaved a sigh of relief as no more Covid-19 cases were identified in this area. Laxminagar, which falls under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB), got its first case on May 22, after a constable who lives in this area tested positive.


The cop, who works at the Bowenpally police station, was tested as part of a random health check-up. The area was immediately cordoned off and a door-to-door survey was conducted by the district medical and health department. 

Thankfully, none of the residents tested positive for Covid-19. Laxminagar, in fact, became the first containment in the SCB after officials declared this area as a hotspot.

“Four special teams comprising auxiliary nurse midwifes’(ANMs) were pressed into service to conduct the survey. Following instructions from the district medical & health office (DM&HO), we had selected 329 houses located within a radius of one kilometre from Laxminagar. In all we covered 1,475 families,” in-charge medical officer (working under DM&HO), Picket, Dr Mary Meena Kumari told STOI. 

Subsequently, the survey was also conducted at Krishna Reddy Nagar Colony. “We did quarantine stamping to three primary contacts and 28 secondary contacts at Laxminagar. Our special teams advised the residents and contacts to follow certain preventive measures. We are on a constant vigil to identify those having symptoms like fever, dry cough and breathlessness,” she said. 

Meanwhile, the SCB health and sanitation wing is sanitising the area, lifting garbage and keeping the roads clean. Essential commodities are being supplied to those families under quarantine in Laxminagar.
