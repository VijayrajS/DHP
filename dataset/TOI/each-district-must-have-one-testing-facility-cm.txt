VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy directed officials on Sunday to ramp up testing facilities for Covid-19. In a review meeting with chief secretary Nilam Sawhney, DGP D Gautam Sawang, special chief secretary Jawahar Reddy and other officials from health department, the CM asked them to complete testing of all attendees of the religious congregation in New Delhi and their primary contacts on a war-footing.


He said testing of secondary contacts should be taken up next, all the while continuing door-to-door survey to identify potential suspects and foreign returnees. The CM further directed them to conduct random testing in the Red Zones.

The officials explained to the CM that they have launched cluster-based random testing at Vizag to assess the spread of the virus. All the Red Zones in Visakhapatnam have been divided into eight clusters and 20 random samples from each cluster are being sent for tests, said the officials, adding that so far all the samples have tested negative. Jaganmohan Reddy told the officials to ensure that isolation wards are set-up in all hospitals, including the private hospitals, across the state and keep them on standby to utilise them whenever the need arises. 

He said the guidelines that have already been issued in this regard should be complied to by all hospitals and any patient who comes up with Covid-19-like symptoms should be treated in the isolation wards.

The chief minister also directed the officials to increase testing facilities so as to conduct rapid tests, adding that each district should have one testing laboratory at least. The officials explained that the testing facilities are now available at seven places and they are working on capacity enhancement at Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam laboratories.
