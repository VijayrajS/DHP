No impact of coronavirus on int’l fund raise: SBI MD
2020-02-28
Mumbai: The coronavirus pandemic that is taking its toll on global trade and travel is not impacting capital raising, said SBI managing director Dinesh Khara.

“The virus has had an impact on industries like auto and pharmaceutical, which are dependent on supply chains, but for SBI there is no impact,” said Khara, who is in charge of global banking and subsidiaries of the SBI group. He added the bank did not see any impact on international capital raising because of the virus.

According to Khara, even if travel is impacted and staff work from home, it is still possible to raise capital. A host of IPOs are expected to hit the market before the financial year ends but investment bankers are bullish about support despite global markets faltering. Economists expect policymakers to respond to the crisis by releasing funds that will bring down interest rates.

According to a Macquarie research report, “Unless Covid-19 is quickly contained, there will be a growing pressure on governments to become more aggressive. It will drive bond yields and curves ever lower, forcing further decline in rates and risk premiums, which will offset lower earnings per share. In that scenario, emerging market flows will continue turning negative but not at a pace indicative of a crash.” It adds that India is the only non-China emerging market that still benefits from foreign inflows. Other trade-dependent markets like South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia and Thailand are seeing outflows.

In India, the IPOs that are in the pipeline, besides SBI Card, include IRFC, Equitas, Antony Waste Management, Computer Age Management Systems, and Shriram Properties. Investment bankers say that while some of the roadshows are being replaced by conference calls, they are not seeing an impact on fund-raising yet.
