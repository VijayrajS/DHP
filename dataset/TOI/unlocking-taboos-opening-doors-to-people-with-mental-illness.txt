Unlocking taboos: Opening doors to people with mental illness

CHENNAI: Five years ago, G Kodhainayagi opened her doors to Rajathi, a client of Better Chances, a Chennai-based NGO promoting holistic wellbeing of people with mental health issues. 

The 40-year-old had been diagnosed with acute schizophrenia after her parents died within two months of each other, and her elder brother could no longer handle her psychotic episodes. 


Rajathi had quite a temper, didnâ€™t like being told what to do, and was spaced out a lot. But she also wore great makeup, loved gardening and watched the 9pm serial without a miss. Today, these are among the things that define her friendship with Kodhainayagi.
