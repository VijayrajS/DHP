‘Revert to open court hearing after lockdown’
2020-04-30
New Delhi: At a time when courts are turning to virtual hearings to keep the wheels of justice moving during the lockdown, the Bar Council of India (BCI) expressed reservations over it becoming the norm.The statutory body for advocates in the country cautioned that virtual hearings could never replace open court hearings and urged the Chief Justice of India to revert to the latter once the lockdown ended.“If such practice was encouraged and allowed to continue, there was not an iota of doubt that more than 95% of the advocates of the country would become brief less and work less and the practice of law would be confined to a limited group of lawyers and justice delivery would be badly affected,” BCI chairman Manan Mishra said in a letter addressed to CJI SA Bobde on Tuesday.Manan’s letter argued that resorting to technology and video conference hearings in times of a pandemic could be the “need of the hour” but termed as “impractical” the notion that it should be extended once the lockdown ended. The BCI also wanted the courts to explore ways in which physical hearings could be conducted in case the lockdown got extended, where social distancing could be maintained yet courts too functioned.The letter countered those advocating a greater say for virtual hearings in court proceedings and said many lawyers, retired judges “and even some sitting judges of the Supreme Court were oblivious to the ground realities of India. They were thinking on such a tangent and making such utopian plans, which was as if, they were planning upon implementing and executing such ideas for a fully developed nation like UK, USA, or in some other country other than India.”Pointing out that justice should be able to permeate the rural as well as urban areas, the BCI chairman argued that technology could at best help in justice delivery system but “to propose to have court proceedings being heard and decided only on video with judge and two party concerned all sitting at different places” could not be accepted.
