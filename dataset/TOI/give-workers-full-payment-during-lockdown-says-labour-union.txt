Give workers full payment during lockdown, says labour union
2020-04-19
Coimbatore: A labour union has sought payment of full wages for workers in industries during the lockdown period. They said some industries were giving full salary, while several were providing only half of the pay. 

In a letter to the chief minister and the minister for labour welfare, representatives of the Coimbatore District Mill Workers Union, under the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), pointed out that the Centre had directed industries not to terminate their employees during the lockdown period and to deem them ‘on duty’. 

However, several industrial units were paying their employees only half the salary, representatives of the union said. They sought the department of labour welfare to take necessary steps to direct the industries to give the full salary of March and April months to their workers.

Industrialists, meanwhile, said they were facing severe fund crunch and it was not viable for them to give workers full pay. They said they have been feeding their workers and giving them essentials during the lockdown. They said the state and the Centre should support them by releasing funds to pay their workers.
