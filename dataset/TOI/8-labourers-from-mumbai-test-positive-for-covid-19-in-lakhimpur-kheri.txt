Bareilly: Three migrant labourers who had returned from Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19 in Lakhimpur Kheri on Saturday, while five others had tested positive on Friday night. Now the tally in Kheri stands at 22, with 17 active cases.

Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agarwal told TOI, “All migrant labourers are being quarantined at home after thermal screening. Samples are being taken randomly for testing. The villages of the positive cases were sealed and patients were shifted to Covid-19 hospital in Behajam for treatment. Samples of the family members will be sent for testing. Meanwhile, villagers have been advised to stay at home and inform at the helpline number if they exhibit any symptoms.”

“Most of the new patients are asymptomatic. We are sending nearly 50 random samples every day for testing,” Agarwal added.

Over 4,000 labourers have returned to Lakhimpur Kheri district from Maharashtra by special trains. Several others are still returning home on foot or hitching rides in trucks or autos.
