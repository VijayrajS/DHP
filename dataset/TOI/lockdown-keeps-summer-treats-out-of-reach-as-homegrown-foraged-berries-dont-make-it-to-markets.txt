Lockdown keeps summer treats out of reach as homegrown, foraged berries don’t make it to markets
2020-04-27
Panaji: Tangy bimblim, hydrating water apples and the sour-sweet berries like jamun, boram, canttam and chunna. Many of these, grown by families for self consumption, are usually distributed among friends and neighbours, who, this year will be deprived of these treats.

“Our love apple tree fruits twice in the summer and sometimes we get so many fruits that even after distribution we are left with plenty to use in salads and juices,” Eva Baretto said. The crop was planted in their property by her grandmother in the seventies.

This time, lockdown restrictions and the fear of meeting people has led the owners of such trees to limit the produce to themselves. 

“I have fond memories of plucking kokum and jamun from my aunt’s tree in Bicholim while going on a hunt for canttam and chunna in the wilds of Valpoi with my cousins. While we outgrew these adventures as adults, the fruits were often sent to us by family members every summer,” a Merces resident said.

Even small-time vendors, who would go house-to-house to gather these fruits, have been unable to do so keeping the fruits out of the markets.

“Village hawkers would come over to our house to collect bimblim and then sell them in the Mapusa market along with other summer fruit they’ve collected from other neighbours. Even that trend may come to a complete stop this year owing to the lockdown,” a Parra-resident said. St Cruz-based Nestor Rangel, who has been growing some of these fruits as a hobby, came to the rescue of Panaji residents looking for water apples.

“Every single fruit we put up was sold. It is not possible to have a street sale so to avoid crowding, we move around from place to place selling the fruits in a vehicle. I’ve been growing these trees as a hobby, but now a lot of people are asking for saplings of the water apple,” he said.
