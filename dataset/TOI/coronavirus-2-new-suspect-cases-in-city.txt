HYDERABAD: Two new suspected cases of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reported at the state-run Gandhi hospital on Sunday. The nine other suspected cases, which were reported on Saturday, have tested negative for the dreaded virus. Both persons had recently returned from China.


With the latest set of reports, a total of 70 people so far have tested negative for the virus. These people, who were previously suspected to be infected, are still being monitored closely by state health authorities, and will remain in home isolation for 14 days. 

Apart from these 70, another 72 people have been kept in quarantine at home, and are being monitored. They have, however, not been tested for the virus so far, as they had not shown any symptoms such as fever, cough, cold or breathing problem, which are associated with the disease.

“All of the suspected cases continue to be under observation of the health department. Teams from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme are monitoring them each day and ensuring that they remain in quarantine till 28 days,” said Vijay Kumar, state nodal officer for Corona.
