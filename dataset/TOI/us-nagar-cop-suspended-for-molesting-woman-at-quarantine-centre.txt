Rudrapur: An Udham Singh Nagar police official was suspended on Sunday for allegedly molesting and misbehaving with a woman at a quarantine centre in Kichha town of the district. The accused constable Jagdish Kumar has also been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. 

Constable Jagdish was suspended after district’s senior superintendent of police Barinderjit Singh took cognisance of the crime.

Sources in the police department told TOI that a newly married couple, who returned to Rameshwarpur village from Delhi on Saturday, was quarantined at Pulbhatta’s Surajmal College. Reportedly, the accused constable Jagdish told them that men and women were to be kept separately. 

The victim woman told TOI, “The constable was in an inebriated state and while guiding me to my room, he not only misbehaved with me but also tore my clothes and tried to molest me. Somehow, I managed to escape.” 

A departmental inquiry has been ordered against the constable, who is on the loose.
