Pune: Students in the city preparing for competitive exams have been facing multiple challenges in the wake of the national lockdown. They want the district and municipal administration to facilitate transport for them to return home. Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “Our top priority is to provide basic facilities and health services to all sections of the society. It will be difficult for us to make transport arrangements.” Laxman Waghmare, an MPSC aspirant from Jalgaon district, said, “As per the previous schedule, the prelim exam was going to be on April 8. Had the government taken the decision to postpone it earlier, we would have gone to our villages,” he said. Some students said they do not have gas to cook food. “We used to have food at the mess. We don’t have a gas cylinder either,” Parikshet Saner, a student from Nashik, said. “Some have their own vehicles and are ready to travel to their native places. The administration should make passes for us so the police will not stop us,” Mauli Naiknavare from Pandharpur in Solapur district said. A senior district official said, “We cannot make alternative arrangements for them. Neither can we issue a pass , otherwise many people could have similar requests.” Most of these students live in Peth areas of the city, where limited shops are open. Some said they didn’t get grocery and food items in nearby shops. Santosh Rathod, another aspirant from Nanded district, said, “I get around Rs2,500 per month from home for my expenses and I paid the mess and room rent from that. Now, I don’t know how to survive with less than Rs500 in with me for the next three days.”
