2020-05-01
NEW DELHI: The total number of Covid cases since April 6 in India has grown from around 5,000 to close to 35,000, and deaths from about 130 to over a thousand.


The health ministry on Thursday placed the share of deaths on account of co-morbidities like diabetes, heart disorders and chronic kidney ailments at 78% -- compared to 86% in its April 6 briefing.

More patients were being cured of the infectious disease as compared to a fortnight ago — 25.2% on Thursday from 13.1% — the ministry said.

So far, 1,075 people have died of the disease, according to central government data, whereas 8,372 have been cured. The total case fatality rate stands at 3.2%, and 65% of deaths were of males and 35% females. The health ministry has recorded 33,610 confirmed Covid-19 cases, of which 24,162 were active cases till 5pm on Thursday. While a sizeable share of deaths was among people between 45 and 60 years of age, 14% deaths were reported among those less than 45 years. Those above 75 years accounted for 9.2% of total deaths. Though geriatric patients are at high risk, the percentage may reflect lesser number of patients in this age group.

While the government did not share the latest age profile analysis for positive cases, the data put out on April 6 showed that the infection rate was higher among younger people with almost 42% cases reported among 21-40 years old, while another 32.8% was in people 41-60 years of age.

However, the low case fatality among younger people was indicative that most of them were cured of the infection, whereas those above 60 and with co-morbidities were more vulnerable to infection even as the number of cases remained low among the elderly.
