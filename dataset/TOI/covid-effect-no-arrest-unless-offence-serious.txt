2020-05-21
Ahmedabad: To stay safe from Covid-19, and to reduce spread by avoiding unnecessary overcrowding in lock-ups, Bapunagar cops are not making arrests in cases where the offence calls for a punishment less than seven years. Instead, they are serving the accused a notice under Section 41(1)(d) to be present before a court on a given date, said inspector N K Vyas of Bapunagar police station.

Vyas said besides the safety of policemen, they have taken the step also for the safety of the accused where unknowingly Covid-negative and Covid-positive persons may have to spend time in close proximity in the lock-up.

“This can lead to the danger of getting infected by Covid-19. We are just handing notices to accused in any offence which is punishable with a sentence of less than seven years. In serious offences we make arrests and first send the person for Covid-19 test before taking him into custody,” added Vyas.

On Tuesday. Bapunagar police registered five cases of violation lockdown norms and notification and all were let off after registering the cases. “They have been given notices to remain present in the court on given dates. We have to work with care while dealing with the accused in such times,” Vyas said.

Out of the five cases, in one case Babu Maheriya, 32, of Shaherkotda was booked for violation of Section 144 and lockdown norms from near Chandabhai Chawl in Bapunagar. “He was booked under Section 188 of IPC, Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act and was handed a notice to appear in court on a particular date” said a police source.

In another case, a man named Bharat Solani was also let off after being booked and handed a notice. “In the other three cases of similar procedure was applied to keep the accused and the policemen both safe,” Vyas said.
