‘No AC booths, so no fear of virus to vote’
2020-03-16
Panaji: BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said the zilla panchayat voters need not worry about the coronavirus as all polling booths are non-AC.

“ZP elections will be held on March 22 as scheduled. Our voting booths are not air conditioned, but well-ventilated and people need not fear getting coronavirus. In fact, they should come in large numbers and exercise their franchise,” Tanavade told reporters on Sunday.

Earlier in the day, Andhra Pradesh state election commission postponed the civic body polls by six weeks due to coronavirus scare. The election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar said that the decision was arrived at after conducting a high-level meeting.

Leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat had accused the BJP-led Goa government of being unprepared to handle the coronavirus threat. 

Reacting to Kamat, Tanavade said if the leader of the opposition wanted any precautionary measures to check coronavirus, then he should call on the chief minister and bat for it instead of indulging in political rhetoric.

He lauded the government efforts to curb the spread of the virus. 

He urged the people to abide by the decision taken by the state.

On Saturday, Sawant had said that sanitisers would be made available for the voters at polling booths for ZP polls and the staff would be provided with masks.
