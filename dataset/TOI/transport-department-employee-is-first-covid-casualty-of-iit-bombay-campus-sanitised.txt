MUMBAI: IIT-B administration swung into action on Friday after the first Covid-19 death was reported on the campus. The victim, in his late 30s, worked in the transport department but stayed outside the campus till a few days back, the institute said. BMC sealed the staff quarters which housed 36 families on Friday. The permanent class III employee moved into the campus probably because he felt it was safer, said an official. 

"When he showed some symptoms the campus hospital directed him to Nair hospital. He passed away on Thursday evening," said director Subhasis Chaudhuri. 

IIT-B is sanitizing the campus and is trying to trace his contacts. The campus has around 10,000 residents.
