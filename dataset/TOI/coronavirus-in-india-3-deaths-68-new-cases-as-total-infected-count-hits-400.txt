2020-03-23
NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 infection claimed three more lives in the country on Sunday, taking the total toll from the disease to seven, even as states continued to report a high number of cases which have now touched 400. On Sunday, 68 new cases were reported by 14 states in all, the second highest for a single day after 77 cases reported on Saturday. 


Bihar became the 22nd state to be affected by Covid-19 in the country with three confirmed cases and one death reported on Sunday. The Bihar victim, Saif Ali, 38, had returned from Qatar recently. 

He was admitted to Patna’s AIIMS with chronic kidney problem on March 20 and given ventilator support. “Ali also had symptoms of Covid-19 so we sent his samples for testing and it came positive,” AIIMS-Patna director Dr PK Singh said. 

Before being referred at AIIMS, Ali was admitted to the emergency ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital on March 19, which has led to fears that he may have infected some of the hospital staff. One death each was reported from Maharasthra and Gujarat, respectively. The ICMR, in an update, confirmed 396 Covid-19 cases in the country. The health ministry said 23 persons have recovered from the disease and one has migrated.
