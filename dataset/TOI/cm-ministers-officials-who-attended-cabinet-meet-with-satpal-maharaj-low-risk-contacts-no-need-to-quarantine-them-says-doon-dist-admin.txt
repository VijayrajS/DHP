Dehradun: The Doon district administration as well as the state health department on Monday decided that chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and his cabinet colleagues — who had attended the cabinet meeting on May 29 along with tourism minister Satpal Maharaj — who was subsequently found Covid-19-positive — were not required to be quarantined as they were categorised as a ‘low-risk contact.’

Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava told TOI that a detailed report was prepared on the social distancing and security norms which were followed during the state cabinet held on May 29, on the basis of which the district administration and health department came to a final conclusion that none of the cabinet ministers or officials present during the cabinet meet were required to be quarantined.

“No minister or senior official came in direct contact with the tourism minister and hence they don’t have to get quarantined,” said the DM.

State urban development minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik who was present during the cabinet meet— the others included agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat and chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh among the prominent attendees —- said that the district administration had issued letters terming those present in the cabinet meet to be low-risk contacts who were not required to be quarantined as per guidelines issued by the central government on May 18. “However, as a precautionary measure, we have decided to be in self quarantine and continue working from home,” Kaushik said.
