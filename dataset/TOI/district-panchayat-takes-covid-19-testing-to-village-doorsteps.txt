2020-04-23
AHMEDABAD: To reduce the risk of spread of Covid-19 infection from the city to the outlying rural areas in Ahmedabad district, the district panchayat has launched a mobile van, which will collect samples from villages and bring them for testing to BJ Medical College. The novel facility, being introduced for the first time, will ensure that suspected patients do not have to travel from rural areas to the city, just for Covid-19 testing.

The sample collecting vehicles will travel to taluka headquarters, nagarpalika headquarters and villages. Samples of suspected patients will be collected by health teams at community health centres (CHCs) or primary health centres (PHCs). 

“The broad aim of introducing this system is to ensure that people from Ahmedabad district do not have to travel to Ahmedabad city for testing. It will go a long way in checking the spread of Covid-19 from the city to the district,” said district development officer Arun Mahesh Babu.

On Wednesday, the mobile van collected nasal and throat swabs of people living in and around Bopal area of the city.

The DDO added that massive surveillance activity has already been carried out for a population of 3.87 lakh people, 6,038 people vulnerable to Covid-19 have been identified. “These people need to be tested, and if the need be, isolated and treated,” Babu said.

As of Wednesday, there have been only 16 Covid-19 positive cases in Ahmedabad district, even as the number of cases in Ahmedabad city have crossed the 1,000 mark. The DDO said that there is a possibility that increased testing will reflect in an increase of Covid-19 positive cases in rural areas, but this will help in isolating affected persons who can be treated immediately.
