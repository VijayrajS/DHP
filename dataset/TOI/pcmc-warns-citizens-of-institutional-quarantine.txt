PCMC warns citizens of institutional quarantine
2020-03-24
Pimpri Chinchwad: The civic body has warned citizens that those who flout the 14-day home quarantine order will be institutionally quarantined for 28 days.

In a statement, mayor Usha “Mai” Dhore said 910 people have so far been home quarantined in the city. “All of them must stay at home for 14 days or, if needed, 28 days more. These people need to abide by these instructions or face legal action. The police will force such violators into institutional quarantine,” the mayor’s statement read. 

The statement said the civic body has issued notice to 10 people for violating quarantine norms “Those who break hospital quarantine will face a jail term of up to six months,” the civic body added. 

The warning assumes significance after a Pradhikaran resident flouted the home quarantine directive a few days ago and was sent, along with a family member, to the isolation ward at the new Bhosari hospital. Also, eight doctors who returned from Tashkent in Uzbekistan on Saturday were sent to home quarantine as they did not inform the civic authorities about their travel history. 

The mayor has appealed to people to pass information about such violators to the Sarathi helpline on 8888006666. 

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “The health of all 12 patients in PCMC isolation wards remain stable ... only one of them has mild symptoms.” 

On Monday, three people were admitted to the New Bhosari hospital and their test results were awaited. Out of 124 people whose throat swabs were sent to the National Institute of Virology, 109 samples have returned negative results.
