JAIPUR: In a new setback to the fight against Covid-19 pandemic, graveyard committees in Jaipur have refused to bury virus victims, fearing the spread of the disease in the community.


Families of three Muslims, who have so far died due to coronavirus in Jaipur, had to take the help of the administration to bury them at the Ghat Gate graveyard.

The administration and civil society groups have kept an earthmover on the standby at the Ghat Gate graveyard as gravediggers are not ready to dig graves for the deceased Covid-19 patients.
