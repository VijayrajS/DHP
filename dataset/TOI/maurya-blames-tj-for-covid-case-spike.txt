LUCKNOW: The BJP escalated attack on Tablighi Jamaat on Thursday with deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya terming the Delhi congregation as the biggest reason behind the rise in Covid-19 cases. 


“People of Tablighi Jamaat are responsible for the rise in number of coronavirus cases, which has put people in danger of getting infected,” he said.

The state government has been receiving complaints about misbehavior by people of Jamaat with doctors, nurses and paramedical staff, which is a cause of concern, he said.

Maurya said the government was forced to seal hotspots in 15 districts because of rise in cases. The government is screening all people in hotspots and sanitizing each house.

People need not panic as government is on high alert and ensuring that no one faces any problem, he said and appealed people to cooperate with district administration in the battle against coronavirus.
