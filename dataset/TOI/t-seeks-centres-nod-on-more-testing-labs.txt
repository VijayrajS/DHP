Telangana seeks Centre’s nod on more testing labs
2020-03-07
HYDERABAD: State health minister Etela Rajender sought the Centre’s permission to start an additional testing facility for Covid-19 in the city. The state pitched the labs at Institute of Preventive Medicine and Fever Hospital as during a video conference with Union minister for health Harsh Vardhan. 


Now, suspected cases are being tested at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) lab at Gandhi Medical College. The lab conducts tests locally and only positive samples are forwarded to National Institute of Virology in Pune for confirmatory test.

 “The Gandhi Medical College lab has been receiving at least 30-40 suspected cases per day. The lab also caters to Andhra Pradesh that sends 10-20 samples per day. The load of 60-70 samples per day is too much for the lab to handle. Each test takes nearly 8 hours and requires high levels of precision,” said a source. 

“As each suspected patient is kept in isolation, a delay in the arrival of results also means extended time in the isolation ward at the hospital. This is not advisable as it exposes patients to other possibly infected patients,” the source added. The Centre also assured that they would supply the 50,000 N95 masks that were requested by the state.
