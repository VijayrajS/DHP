Hyderabad: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao will decide after a key cabinet meeting on Monday its strategy to contain the spread of Covid-19 and take a call on relaxations, even as 42 more positive cases were reported in the state. 

The state cabinet will discuss fresh guidelines issued by the Centre on the lockdown, its implementation locally and guidelines for a proposed regulatory agriculture policy of the government. The chief minister had earlier extended the lockdown in the state up to May 29.

While all states have been authorised to decide and demarcate on the red, orange and green zones duly following the norms and guidelines laid down by the Centre, KCR was worried about the rising number of cases in Hyderabad.
