GUNTUR: Police are playing a crucial role in Covid fight by tracing source of virus infection. The aggressive approach in rounding up of primary and secondary contacts of positive patients is keeping the virus spread under check in many instances.

“Special teams consisting senior officers have been constituted to zero-in on not only the source of the virus but also the contacts of the suspected cases. Special teams are working overtime in tracing and tracking the virus spreaders,” said Guntur rural district Superintendent of Police (SP) Ch Vijaya Rao.

“Unless, we work in a scientific way, it is difficult to break the virus chain. Our men are working with speed to catch the final contact in all possible cases,” said Vijaya Rao.

Within minutes after getting the alert about the death of a cable network staffer in Narasaraopet due to Covid-19, the police rounded up nearly 300 people in Ramireddipeta, Varavakatta areas and sent them to quarantine. Their suspicion proved right when nine of them turned positive for Covid-19.

The police then identified a few people with Covid symptoms at a private hospital. “We identified a home guard residing near the first victim. Along with his wife, 14 people in the hospital where he got treatment for cold were rounded up and tested positive. It is said that nearly 26 people in their families were infected and another 22 in their neighbourhood, taking the tally of positive cases in Nararaopet to 48,” said Vijaya Rao.

Similarly, the police identified nearly 40 suspects in Nakirekallu. When the locals of Dachepalle initially resisted to move to the quarantine home, the SP deputed senior officials to the spot and prevailed upon them of the benefit of going under t quarantine. This helped contain the spread of the virus as another six people tested positive from the initial suspects.
