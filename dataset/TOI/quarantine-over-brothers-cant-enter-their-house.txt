UDUPI: Two siblings have not been allowed to enter their house even after completing 14 days of quarantine. They are spending time at a bus stop at Udupi. 

Vishwu Shetty Ambalapady, a social worker, said the duo had not got their second Covid-19 test report and as per the governments’ new guidelines they were sent home for home quarantine. However, their neighbours and relatives insisted that the duo get the second report. 

“The brothers came to Udupi from another district 14 days ago. Although they were advised home quarantine, they had to opt for institutional quarantine owing to objection from public. Though their swabs were taken, the report was not received, and doctors sent them home,” he added.
