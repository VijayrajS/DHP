KANPUR: A 33-year-old native of Meerut, who tested positive for COVID 19, allegedly created ruckus at Sarsaul CHC quarantine facility, before being shifted from Rama Medical college in Mandhana on Sunday. 


"Not only, he created ruckus, but he spit on a doctor and bolted the room from inside demanding better hospitality," said medical superintendent Dr SL Verma.

The matter escalated to such an extent that the cops had to intervene and explain him to follow protocol.

The man who had come to the city recently had attended Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi. "On Friday, he has been put under quarantine at Rama Medical college as a precautionary measure," said senior health official.

CHC medical superintendent further stated that one should understand that this is not a luxury retreat, but this is a quarantine facility.

Meanwhile, a man was booked for selling `gutkha' from his outlet in Gilish Bazar area under the limits of Kotwali police station on Sunday. "The incident came to light after some local posted a video of the shopkeeper selling gutkha from his outlet in Gilish bazar area. Police swung into action after coming across the video on social media and subsequently booked the owner of the outlet under section 188/271 of IPC and launched an investigation in this regard," said SP East Raj Kumar Agarwal.
