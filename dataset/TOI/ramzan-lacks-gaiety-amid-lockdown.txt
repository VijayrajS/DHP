2020-05-26
COIMBATORE: Muslims across the district conducted special prayers along with their family members at their houses on Monday to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr that marks the end of month-long fasting in the month of Ramzan. Some families were found praying on the terrace of their houses. 

Joint secretary of the Coimbatore District Sunnath Jamath Kolgai Kuttamaipu A Faizal said the prayers were conducted between 6:30am and 8am.

While imams conducted prayers at mosques, people prayed at their home. “”A special prayer was conducted to help us during the pandemic situation,” said M Abdul Hakkim, secretary of Jamaat e Islmai Hind. “At the mosque, we would just follow the instructions given by the Imam while praying. As it was not the situation this year, mosques had sent us a set of instructions that needed to be followed while praying either as text or videos at least a day ahead. Based on the instructions, a family member led the prayer and others followed.”

“We prepared biryani in large quantity and shared it with friends, relatives, frontline workers like police officers and health workers,” Hakkim said.
