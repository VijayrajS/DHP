Bengaluru: As demand for hand sanitisers reaches a new peak amid the spread of the coronavirus, FMCG major Dabur entered the segment over the weekend with ‘Dabur Sanitize’, two people aware of the matter said. TOI has seen the product images and its listing on Amazon India, which was sold out over the weekend. The company has confirmed the same.

Over the past two weeks, demand for hand sanitisers and masks have spiked multiple times as people rushed to buy them to protect them from the virus. Online platforms have now put limits on the number of units one can buy, with the government declaring them essential commodities to prevent hoarding.

Dabur Sanitize was supposed to be launched next month, but the coronavirus situation led to advancing the timelines, which now pits it against two existing large brands — Reckitt Benckiser’s Dettol and HUL’s Lifebuoy.

“Dabur Sanitize was launched over this weekend. It has initially been launched only on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, and was sold out within a day. We are now ramping up production and are also planning an offline launch in the coming days,” a Dabur spokesperson said.
