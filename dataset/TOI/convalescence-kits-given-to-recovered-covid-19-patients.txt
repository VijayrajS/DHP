TRICHY: The department of Indian medicine and homeopathy department, in Trichy on Monday, provided a convalescence kit comprising siddha medicines and taught few yoga exercises to the recently-recovered Covid-19 patients to help them gain physical and mental strength.

Dean of Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Dr K Vanitha gave away the kit containing a pack of 100 Amukkara tablets and a 250g pack of Nellikai Legiyam, to 14 patients, who were discharged from the hospital after their recovery from Covid-19 on Monday. Adults can take two tablets of Amukkara two times a day with milk after food, while around 5-10g of legiyam can be taken twice a day after food.

The kit was a part of the Arokiyam scheme launched by Tamil Nadu government to fight Covid-19 outbreak. Though the scheme had been announced already, the kit arrived only now. The hospital has already discharged 86 recovered Covid-19 patients so far, without the kits. District siddha medical officer (DSMO), Trichy Dr S Kamaraj said that Amukkara tablet will improve stamina while nellikai legiyam is rich in Vitamin C and will act as an immunity booster.

Assistant siddha medical officer Dr M Vathsala, who was also part of the government siddha practitioners' team for the programme spoke on the importance of recovered patients keeping immunized post discharge.

“The recovered patients may be under the impression that they may not require medication. Despite recovery, they should self-quarantine at their houses, using separate food plate, rest room etc, besides taking the Amukkara and nellikai legiyam and the doctor-prescribed medicines for at least one month,” Vathsala told TOI.
