Jaipur was granted ODF ++ status this year but it is yet to be announced by the central team in the final results. With the delay in results of 2019-20, Swachhta survey of 2021-22 has also been delayed. Last year, Jaipur ranked 41 across the country. The total number of points has been increased to 6,000 this year and the result are yet to be announced.Jaipur had difficulty in getting good citizen feedback that had put a dent in getting good ranking since the last two years. This year efforts were made by Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) to get feedbacks from citizens. Officials visited many educational institutions to motivate people to give feedback on the Swachhta app. It seems Jaipur city has to wait for a while till pandemic is over.
