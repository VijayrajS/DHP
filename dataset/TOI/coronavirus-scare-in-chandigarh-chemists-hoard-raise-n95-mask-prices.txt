Coronavirus scare in Chandigarh: Chemists hoard, raise N-95 mask prices
2020-03-05
CHANDIGARH: City-based chemists have started hoarding and increasing the rates of three-layered and N-95 masks four to five times, at a time when 29 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the country. 


Dr G Dewan, director, health services (DHS), UT, on Wednesday wrote to the deputy commissioner to regulate prices and prevent hoarding. The health workers and hospital staff usually wear these masks to prevent the transmission of viruses.

"We have written to the chemists' association not to hoard or sell in black markets any non-scheduled and scheduled drugs in context of the outbreak of coronavirus. This is under the drugs pricing regulation control Act," said the DHS. According to him, when it was brought to his notice that these masks are being hoarded, he requested the deputy commissioner to regulate masks and other personal protective equipment.

Amarjit Singh, president, Chemists' Association, Chandigarh, however, blamed residents for creating panic and hoarding the masks. "People are stocking these masks even for their relatives. There is no need to panic and stock these masks," he said. He said, "Since there is an increase in demand for masks and hand sanitisers, the rates of these items have been hiked." 

Sources said there is enough stock of masks, protective gowns and head coverings . "The UT health department has around 25,000 N95 masks for hospital staff and placed order for 500 more on Wednesday," said an official in the health department.

PGI has not recommended masks for use by general public. "Hoarding of masks can actually hurt the response by reducing the supply available for the health providers to have masks when caring for people exposed to the virus," said a doctor in a private hospital. He said, "We do not have N95 masks, while the three-layered mask, which otherwise costs Re 1 per piece has increased to Rs 50 per piece."
