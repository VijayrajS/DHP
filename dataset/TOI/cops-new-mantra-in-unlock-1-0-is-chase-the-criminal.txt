2020-06-09
Nagpur: City police have entered unlock 1.0 phase with their own ‘Operation Crackdown Phase-II’, spanning 10 days from June 5, with the motto ‘chase the criminal’.There was a spurt in murder cases in May-end, as the lockdown started relaxing, and cops were busy in the containment zones to stop community transmission of Covid-19. So, CP BK Upadhyay had launched the intense anti-criminal drive.With many cops now freed from the responsibility of feeding and sheltering migrant labourers, Addl CP, crime, Nilesh Bharne and DCP, crime, Gajanan Rajmane also went back to core policing. Rajmane had immediately set specific targets for all crime branch units across the city, with timely review of performance.Around 1,917 offenders had been checked till Sunday, anticipating that loosening of lockdown may give rise to increased criminal activities. Around 90 goons were slapped with preventive actions and several offences, including 25 under the Indian Arms Act, were registered.Addl CP Bharne said every day police are checking those released from jail, with criminal past records, staying in city violating externment orders, gangsters, goons, and anti-social elements.With six murders in the first week of June, including a dacoity, the rising criminal tendency is apparent, leaving cops no option but to start zeroing down on all goons, whether active or otherwise.CP Upadhyay is also issuing fresh reminders of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to logistics and financial companies dealing in cash. “We may act against logistics and financial companies if we find them violating SOPs like carrying cash on bikes,” he said.Bharne too said that though law and order is police responsibility, this does not gives citizens and others permission to flout prescribed norms.Most of the recent half-dozen murders were due to personal enmity. However, the murder of dreaded goon Balya Wanjari near Pardi raise question as he had been checked a day before by Pardi police.Bharne said any mission is not foolproof assurance of making the city ‘zero crime’, but police are more pro-active and effective in this period.CHECKING ACCOUNT235 persons with murder cases checked125 persons released from jail checked63 gangsters checked199 active criminals checked176 externed goons checked 25 cases of Arms Act registered
