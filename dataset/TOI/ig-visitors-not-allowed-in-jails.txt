PATNA: The state’s prison directorate has taken preventive measures against Coronavirus (Covid-19) in view of suspected cases reported from some districts in the last few days. 


Inspector general of prisons, Mithilesh Mishra, issued an order on Saturday regarding a ban on visitors to different jails. Besides, at least 100 prisoners lodged in the high security prison at Beur in Patna were shifted to the Bhagalpur central jail. Few others are likely to be transferred to the Phulwarisharif jail in Patna.

At present, approximately 4,400 prisoners are lodged in the Beur central jail. “This is part of the precautionary measures being taken by the jail administration against Covid-19. Like other government departments, we are equally concerned,” a senior officer posted at the prison directorate told this newspaper.

He added, “An awareness campaign has already been launched and the prisoners have been told to follow the advisory issued to them by the directorate. They have to keep their wards clean, maintain hygiene and report to the officials immediately if symptoms of Covid-19 are found.”

On Saturday, medical teams visited different wards of the Beur central jail, which accommodates the highest number of undertrial as well as convicted prisoners in the state.

Similar instructions have been issued to jail superintendents of other central, district and sub-divisional jails. However, no positive case of Covid-19 has been detected in any of the 58 jails across the state so far.
