HC permits abortion on Covid-positive teen
2020-05-08
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday directed a team of doctors at Civil Hospital to terminate the 24-week pregnancy of a 14-year-old rape survivor, who is also Covid-19 positive.

Justice V B Mayani in his order said, “Doctors shall take due care and caution for the health and best interest of the victim. Once the termination of pregnancy is performed and completed, the victims shall continue to take treatment for her good health for the period as per the opinion of the doctors.”

The court has sought a report from the doctor next week, and ordered them to take DNA samples of the foetus for further police investigation, because the victim’s brother-in-law is accused in this case.

The HC ordered the abortion after the survivor and her elder sister, who is a petitioner before the high court, gave written consent to advocate Hardik Dave, who was assigned the case by the legal aid committee. 

The HC had sought consent from the victim and her elder sister on the insistence of the doctors, because the victim was also tested Covid-19 positive, though she did not have any co-morbid condition. However, the doctors opined that besides the usual risk, what they could not make predictions about this case as the because of the victim’s Covid-19 position.

Before issuing directions, the HC took into consideration earlier orders passed by the high court as well as by the Supreme Court in cases in which the rape survivors’ age was 14 years and the pregnancy was beyond 23-24 weeks.
