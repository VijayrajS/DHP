VIJAYAWADA: The Union health ministry on Wednesday identified 11 of the 13 districts in Andhra Pradesh as ‘hotspot districts’ or red zones with “large outbreaks” of Covid-19.


These 11 districts are Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore, Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur and Chittoor. The only districts left out are Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. They have been classified as green zone districts.

According to the health ministry, the hotspot districts have been classified either based on the criteria of the number of cases or on the growth rate of cases.

The districts, which have not recorded any new cases in the last 28 days, are the green zone districts. When it comes to the criteria for shifting of the categories, a hotspot district will be declared as an orange zone district, if it did not record any new case in the last 14 days. And if the trend continues for the next 14 days in that particular district, it will be classified as a green zone district. The exercise of identification of hotspots will be done on a weekly basis.

The major focus of the containment strategy for the hotspot districts will be on geographic quarantine with a complete clampdown on the movement of people in the area where the cases are reported.

The containment operation would be deemed over when there is no case reported in 28 days since the day of last case tests negative.

Meanwhile, the state government identified 42 mandals as red zones and 47 mandals as orange zones, while 587 mandals fall in the green zone list. According to the state officials, they are exploring the option of door-delivering the essential commodities in the red zone areas apart from intensifying the containment measures in these areas. Guntur, Kurnool and Nellore account for more than 55 percent cases in the state.
