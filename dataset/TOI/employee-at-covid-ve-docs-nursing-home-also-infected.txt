Kolhapur: A woman working in the nursing home run by a doctor, who had earlier contracted Covid-19, also tested positive for the infection on Monday. The doctor, who had also been providing his service at the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation-run hospital and had come in contact with patients and staff there, had tested positive on Sunday.A containment zone has been marked around the Rankala Tower area and all the contacts are being traced. So far, 60 contacts have been traced. While 20 of the contacts are from the KMC-run hospital, 40 others are linked to the nursing home.A senior health official, requesting anonymity, said, “We are also tracing the patients the doctor had treated since he came in contact with his Solapur-returned maternal uncle, who had tested positive a few days ago. We had hired the doctor on an honorary basis to provide treatment to the patients admitted in our hospitals. He was also regularly attending to patients in his father’s.”The official said that a door-to-door survey has been initiated in the containment and buffer zones. The KMC has appealed to the residents to come forward and get themselves screened if they show Covid-19 symptoms. The doctor had got himself tested only after he started showing symptoms. “There may be many who have contracted the infection. However, they may not be showing symptoms. It is challenging for us to ensure that both low-risk and high-risk contacts are screened immediately,” said the official.The official said that swabs of only those showing symptoms will be sent for testing, while the rest of the contacts will either be put in home or institutional isolation for 14-days. These Covid-positive cases have been reported after one-and-half months in the city.
