Andhra Pradesh plans more sample collection centres for Covid-19
2020-04-12
VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government has notified 11 more Covid-19 sample collection centres after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved Truenat — a tuberculosis-testing machine — for conducting Covid-19 tests.

The state already has 26 such centres in Andhra Pradesh Vaidya Vidhana Parishad hospitals, with two to three centres in each district. 

All districts, except Srikakulam and Vizianagaram which have not reported any positive cases of Covid-19, will get new sample collection centres.

Sample data will be entered online by the hospital on the government portal before the sample is sent to a testing laboratory. Nodal officers at the centres will designate ENT specialists and other trained personnel and supporting staff for sample collection.

The state has 240 Truenat centres. Each machine can test about 15 to 20 samples a day. The time taken for testing each sample through a Truenat machine is about an hour compared to six hours through the existing method of RT-PCR testing. 

The state has also placed an order to procure three lakh rapid diagnostic testing kits. These kits will be used for community surveillance in containment clusters and quarantine centres.

There are at present seven testing laboratories in the state with a combined testing capacity of nearly 1,100 samples a day.
