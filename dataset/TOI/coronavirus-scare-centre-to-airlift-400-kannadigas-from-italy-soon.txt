Italy is currently in lockdown and India has also imposed stringent restrictions on entry of people from abroad, including Indian nationals.


Congress member Priyank Kharge raised the issue of people from Karnataka in Italy on Tuesday. Narayan said about 1,000 Indians including 400 from Karnataka, were stranded at Milan and Rome airports. “They were coming back to India from Italy, but their flights got cancelled. No airline is ready to fly them to India,” he said.

About 150 in the group of 400 are students. “Arrangements are being made with the help of the central government. The process of health check-up has been completed at Milan airport, and blood samples of those at Rome airport are being collected. Those who test positive will be isolated and others will be airlifted soon,” said Narayan.

Kharge said the process to bring back Indians should be fast-tracked. “Especially students, who don’t have sufficient money on hand,” Kharge said. Minister Anand Singh made a similar appeal, saying his daughter was among 90 students waiting to be flown back to India from Rome airport. “I spoke to her last night (Monday), but have been unable to contact her again,” he said.
