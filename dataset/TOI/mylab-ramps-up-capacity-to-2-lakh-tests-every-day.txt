Pune: Mylab ramps up capacity to 2 lakh Covid-19 tests every day
2020-05-08
PUNE: City-based Mylab Discovery Solutions on Thursday said it has scaled up its production capacity of Covid-19 testing kits to enable 2 lakh tests every day. 

A single Mylab kit can test 100 samples for coronavirus. The company is now ready to produce 20,000 test kits daily. 

The company said the increased capacity does not mean that the quality of the test would be compromised. “Our focus on quality is more than ever. Equipped with endogenous internal control for the housekeeping gene, our kits can detect samples which were not collected, transported or processed correctly and remove false negatives,” Hasmukh Rawal, managing director, Mylab Discovery Solutions, said. 

The two key tie-ups — with Pune-based Serum Institute of India’s CEO Adar Poonawalla and Biocon subsidiary Syngene — helped the company ramp up its manufacturing operations. Poonawalla’s multimillion-dollar investment in Mylab gave it the scale to go big, while the tie-up with Syngene helped the company to further localise the kits and reduce dependence on imports. “As production capacity increases to 2 lakh tests per day, we will now be able to meet India’s growing demand for testing completely,” Poonawalla said.

As per the Indian Council of Medical Research, India had tested about 13.5 lakh samples by May 7 (9 am). The testing capacity has now been ramped up to around 80,000 tests per day.
