2020-04-19
Agra: To stop the spread of novel coronavirus, the Agra district administration is planning to identify buffer zones where massive sample testing will be conducted within a radius of 5 km around places where multiple Covid-19 cases have surfaced so far. A special team of the health department has been constituted to conduct the tests. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Certain changes have been made in the coronavirus containment plan for the district. We will be expanding the areas of a few existing hotspots in the city from where multiple coronavirus cases have surfaced. These areas will be marked as buffer zone, and massive sampling will be done here. All the people suspected of Covid-19 infection will be shifted to a nearby institutional quarantine facility. The exercise is mainly aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus.” SN Medical College (SNMC) of Agra is emerging as a major coronavirus hotspot in the city. So far, eight cases of health staffers working in different departments at the government hospital has surfaced. Of these, three are junior doctors and five are supporting staff, including four ward boys. The health department is collecting samples of all the staffers of SNMC. On Saturday, five family members of a ward boy tested positive for Covid-19. Meanwhile, the state government has sent a two-member team, comprising senior doctors of King George Medical University (KGMU). The team has been tasked to find out the reasons behind the increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases in Agra and health staffers getting infected. So far, four patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 have died at SNMC. Chief medical officer Mukesh Kumar Vats said, “So far, 199 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Agra. A total of 21 patients have been cured of the infection and discharged from hospital. All the people who had come in contact with any Covid-19 patient are being identified and screened. The areas around their houses are being sanitized. We are doing massive sample testing to identify infected people and send them to institutional quarantine."
