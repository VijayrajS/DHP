Thrissur: The nationwide lockdown has created a shadow over Thrissur Pooram too. 

The preparation meeting of Thrissur Pooram which was scheduled on April 1 was again postponed in the wake of nationwide lockdown.

The outbreak of Covid-19 will affect the Pooram too, said officials. The Thiruvampadi and Paramekkavu devaswom officials are plannig to conduct the the fest only as a ritual.

Thiruvambady devaswom president P Chandrasekaran said, “In the present situation, there is less chance to conduct the pooram.” Paramekkavu devaswom secretary G Rajesh said, “Currently, we have stopped all pooram-based preparations. During pooram we need 65 sets of umbrellas for the Kudamattam ceremony.. However, we have stopped making it."

“The two -month-long pooram exhibition too has been cancelled," he said.

Cochin devaswom board president A B Mohanan said, “In the wake of nationwide lock-down, all the temple festivals under the devaswom board have been canalled with immediate effect. Earlier, we decided to conduct Peruvanam and Arattupuzha poorams as rituals. But now we decided to cancel them completely.” 

The cancellation of Pooram has also hit vendors in the town. “With the start of the Pooram season, we will usually get huge business. The pandemic has destroyed our hopes,” said Lathif, who runs a hotel in Thrissur.
