Small nursing homes also part of Covid infra: Delhi government
2020-06-14
NEW DELHI: With a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the city and a requirement of around 15,000 beds by the end of this month, the state government on Saturday declared all small nursing homes — with bed strength ranging between 10 and 49 — as Covid nursing homes.

The government also directed 117 private nursing homes, with bed strength of 50 or more, to reserve at least 20% of its beds for Covid-19 patients.

As per the order issued by Directorate General of Health Services, more than 70% Covid beds in the private sector are already occupied and it is projected that there would be a requirement of over 15,000 beds by June 30. This requirement is likely to further swell up to 33,000 by July 15.

All nursing homes with bed strength between 10 and 49 beds have been declared Covid nursing homes to avoid intermingling of Covid and non-Covid cases in small and medium multi-specialty nursing homes.

Delhi government, however, has exempted exclusive eye centres, ENT centres, dialysis centres, maternity homes and IVF centres from this direction.

The nursing homes have been directed to make their Covid beds functional within three days and non-compliance would be treated as violation, and action, as deemed fit by the government, would be initiated against the defaulter nursing homes.
