2020-04-27
Nagpur: Among the many firsts amid the Covid-19 lockdown will be the convocation of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (Deemed University), Wardha, which will be held on Monday on a virtual platform.

DMIMS management clarified that a traditional convocation ceremony will also be held whenever the government guidelines permit in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

Pro-chancellor Dr Ved Prakash Mishra took the initiative of holding a ‘notional’ convocation and streaming it on the institute’s website as well as YouTube. This will enable the university to fulfil the mandate of the University Grants Commission (UGC) of awarding degrees to the graduates within 180 days of passing the examination even in this challenging period and thus avoid inconvenience to the students who aspire for further studies or jobs.

The degrees and awards will be conferred to the students in absentia.

The video streaming will begin at 5pm on Monday and total of 791 degrees will be conferred. These include 336 from medicine faculty, 165 from dentistry, 98 from ayurveda, 163 from nursing, 19 from allied health sciences, eight from physiotherapy and two from the faculty of interdisciplinary sciences. These degrees include 502 undergraduate, 210 postgraduate, one DM, 68 fellowship, eight MPhil and two PhD awardees.
