Dehradun: Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Anil Raturi on Saturday made an appeal to the people, who are returning to Uttarakhand from other states, to strictly follow home quarantine norms. He warned that those who are found violating home quarantine norms will be booked under the Disaster Management Act. 

The DGP also urged residents to be vigilant and inform the police regarding any violation in quarantine norms. 

At present, more than 4,424 people have been put under home quarantine in the state. Among them, 24 people have been home quarantined in containment zones of Dehardun.

“We all are aware that not only the country but the entire world is battling Covid-19. In such times, best possible efforts are being made in Uttarakhand to keep the situation under control. To prevent the spread of the virus, we need everyone’s support,” said DGP Raturi in a video message.

He added, “Home quarantine is mandatory for people who are returning from other states. Therefore, we appeal to them to complete the quarantine period. This is for their safety and that of the society. A person may be booked under Disaster Management Act if he or she is found violating the stipulated norms.”

To recall, a few days earlier, Dehradun police had booked a man under relevant sections of IPC and the Disaster Management Act for violating home quarantine norms.

Meanwhile, the Doon district administration has released two landline numbers — 0135-2729250 and 0135-2722142 — for people to report any violation of home quarantine. 

Dehradun’s district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava told TOI, “We are monitoring people who have been put under home quarantine. The identity of the person who reports any home quarantine violation will be kept confidential.”
