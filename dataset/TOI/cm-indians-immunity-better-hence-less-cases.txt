LUCKNOW: Interacting with students brought from Kota recently, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said the government will set up good coaching centres so that students from UP do not have to go to other cities.


Around 11,500 students from UP had been stuck in Kota, a city famous for its coaching institutes where lakhs of students go each year to train for competitive exams. 

“Prepare for competitions from your homes now. See the courses that are available online. Our effort is to set up good educational centres to help students prepare for competitive examinations so that they need not go outside the state,” CM Yogi said.

Asking them to contact government if they need help, Yogi said India is doing much better than so called ‘developed’ nations due to the timely lockdown.

On relatively less cases and deaths in India compared to US and European nations, the CM said that immune system of Indians is stronger.

“Those who adopted new way of living, consuming fast food, are now realising the dangers. In UP, about 70-75% of the 1,900 cases are asymptomatic which means their immunity is strong. This illness has given us an opportunity to return to the Indian way of life,” he said.

The safe and secure return of Kota students to their homes is a success story, highlighting patience in the time of adversity, he said.
