2020-05-01
MALAPPURAM: It has been found that heedless of quarantine protocols, a Kayamkulam native travelled across the state, shuttling between the houses of his two wives, from Kayamkulam to Nilambur in Malappuram and then back again to Kayamkulam, beating all travel restrictions during the lockdown period. A case has been registered against the man by Kayamkulam police for violating quarantine rules.


Police officers in Nilambur said the man had attended Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin in March, and returned to his home in Kalavoor in Kayamkulam. After completing 14 days of quarantine in Kayamkulam, he went to the house of his second wife at Chokkad near Nilambur on April 20, violating the lockdown rules. After local residents informed the police about the personâ€™s arrival in Chokkad, health authorities directed him to be in home quarantine again for 14 days.

But violating the quarantine rule, he again returned to Kayamkulam on Monday. Sources said he travelled in goods and private vehicles and managed to reach Kayamkulam. On his return, he had a heated argument with his first wife (who did not know of the existence of the other woman) and he approached police with a complaint against his first wife.

It was after a detailed interrogation that the police came to know that he violated quarantine rules and they decided to register a case against him. He was told to stay put at an isolation centre and quarantine himself for a third time.
