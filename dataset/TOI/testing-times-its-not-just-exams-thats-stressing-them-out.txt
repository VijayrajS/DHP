Testing times: It’s not just exams that’s stressing them out
2020-03-03
NEW DELHI: Friends Tanu Thakur and Isha Jain, students of a government school in Yamuna Vihar, reached their exam centre right on time on Monday to write their physics paper for the Central Board of Secondary Education Class XII exams. Like them, many others too reached their designated exam centres in northeast Delhi after the schedule had been disrupted for a few days by the rioting.


For the two friends, both residents of Bhajanpura — as it was for most candidates from the district — preparing for the exams wasn’t easy, their life was turned topsy-turvy in the past week by the violence and arson and the resulting loss of homes, schools and learning material. Even after the clashes ended, there still was tension and uncertainty in the air, creating an atmosphere that wasn’t conducive to serious studying.

“We spent some very stressful days,” said Thakur, perhaps understating her problems. “There was so much noise around that it was very difficult for us to sit and study.”

It was amid heavy security at the 86 examination centre in northeast Delhi that the exams were held on Monday. To alleviate their anxieties, police stationed at one of the centres handed roses to the students. CBSE later said an attendance of 98.2% was recorded on the day — of the 2,888 candidates registered for classes XII and X in Northeast district, 2,837 candidates were present, while 51 were absent.

Parents, as nervous and uncertain as their wards, accompanied the candidates to the centres and waited there for the entire exam duration of three hours. Mustafabad student Shoiba Parveen was escorted to her exam centre at Yamuna Vihar B Block by her mother. Her father went with her brother, whose exam centre was at Karawal Nagar.

“The three days of rioting were very frightening. It was overwhelming to return to books after hearing of what was taking place outside the house. But it is about a year’s effort, so we tried to forget everything else and just study,” said Parveen. 

Some of the students had seen violence on February 24. One of them, a private school candidate, had gone that day to write his exam in the badly affected Chand Bagh. “Our exams got over at 1.30pm, but I reached home in Krishna Nagar only at 5.30pm. It was so frightening. The metro station was closed too,” he related.

At the Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School in Yamuna Vihar, Arif and Naghma of Tukhmirpur were waiting for their daughter. “Last Monday, when our daughter was leaving the school, there was stone-pelting going on in the streets and police were using teargas shells,” Arif, a daily wager, said. “Thankfully, our home isn’t far from her school, but if we had taken a wrong route that day, things would have turned out badly for us.”

Seeta, a parent from Bhajanpura, said the atmosphere had frayed the nerves of the students, already taut at the thought of exams. “But their teachers called to dispel their fears and to tell the kids to ignore the rumours and focus on studies,” she said.

A teacher, who was invigilating at one of the centres, confirmed, “We have been counselling the youngsters, giving them words of courage and motivating them.”
