PCB plans to set up three Covid-19 care centres
2020-05-11
PUNE: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has sought approval from the district collector on a proposal to set up three Covid-19 Care Centers of 100-bed capacity each. Two such centres will be set up in Modikhana and one in Ghorpadi. The centres will cater to positive, asymptomatic patients, who must be kept under observation.

“Anticipating the collector’s approval, we have started working on the proposed facilities at Mahadji Shinde High School and Babasaheb Ambedkar Industrial Training Institute in Modikhana and Ghorpadi High School. We will hire the services of para-medics from private hospitals for the facilities. The board has approved a proposal to the effect,” PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar told TOI. 

The PCB has recorded 68 Covid-19 positive cases, including three deaths, since the second week of March. It has since set up a 120-bed Covid-19 health care centre at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital. The three upcoming facilities would augment PCB’s health infrastructure to fight the contagion.

District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “We will provide all kind of assistance to the PCB. I have conducted a spot review of the affected areas and we feel the board is in need of the proposed Covid care centres in the cantonment.”

Meanwhile, CEO Kumar said, “Considering the density of population and violation of social distancing norms, we have started collecting samples of as many residents as possible to identify positive cases and trace their contacts.” 

The use of common public toilets, proximity to severely affected areas like Bhavani Peth, and concealment of health conditions are some factors causing a spike in cases in the cantonment, an analysis by the PCB revealed. Kumar said, “Most positive patients from New Modikhana and Bhimpura had come in contact with residents of Bhavani Peth.”
