2020-06-09
KOLKATA: The West Bengal government has enhanced the stipend for junior doctors in the state, bringing cheer among the frontline Covid warriors during this pandemic. Minister of state health for health and family welfare Chandrima Bhattacharya announced the hike for interns, house staff, post-graduate trainees and post-doctoral trainees on Monday. The doctors said this will encourage them to work harder during this tough time.


 

“We, as young doctors, are really happy with this stipend hike. It will definitely boost the morale of thousands of junior doctors like me working hard during this period of pandemic,” said Saurav Sarkar, an intern at SSKM Hospital.

“These junior doctors are our warriors and they are working very hard. The chief minister, despite this economic crisis, has enhanced their stipend in recognition and appreciation of the hard work these junior doctors are putting up,” Bhattacharya said. 

“Around 10,000 junior doctors will benefit from this hike and the stipend amount will keep increasing from time to time as and when DA is implemented,” she added.

Even though junior doctors from different medical colleges had raised several issues, including the insufficient number of personal protection equipment (PPE) and masks available, none had taken to cease-work. They said that now the supply of masks and PPE is regular and the enhanced stipend will encourage them to work harder.

“It is a welcome move recognizing the efforts by junior doctors, especially the interns who had just started work when the pandemic reached India. They will be hugely encouraged,” said Indrajit Malik, a third-year post-graduate trainee in surgery at NRS Medical College.
