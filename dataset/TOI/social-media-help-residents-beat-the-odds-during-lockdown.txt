Mysuru: For thousands of city residents locked up in their homes, social media groups are coming handy. Whether it is for a visit to hospital or to arrange blood for the needy or to get some services, these groups have touched the lives of people in the past few weeks.

Many groups in platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook, which were almost silent in the preceeding weeks, became active during the lockdown period.

According to Sahana Ajit, a resident of Hebbal, who is part of several groups, the biggest advantage of these groups is that they give correct guidance. “Even if someone tries to mislead, other members used to alert. Medical services, blood donation and repair of household items like washing machine, water purifier etc were the main issues during the lockdown period. Many even helped needy families by highlighting their issues and connecting with blood donors etc,” she said.

Samarth, a resident of Mysuru, who is now staying in Bengaluru, said he was able to ensure all the services to his aged parents who stay in Srinagar through these groups. “I wanted medicines and vegetables for my parents. These groups helped me with genuine contacts. But the users must be very careful as many times miscreants tries to mislead,” he said.

Damodar Suvarna, admin of one such groups, said social media activities peaked after the lockdown was announced. “School- related topics, house hold repairs, medical emergency services are the major subjects discussed,” he said.
