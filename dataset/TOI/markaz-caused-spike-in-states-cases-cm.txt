Tablighi Jamaat Markaz caused spike in Gujarat’s Covid-19 cases: CM Vijay Rupani
2020-04-09
GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Vijay Rupani said that while the number of Covid-19 cases was relatively low in Gujarat in the initial phase, a spike in cases has been recorded because of people either visiting the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Nizamuddin or local people coming in contact with the attendees. “The government has sealed all 15 affected areas and is trying to test every possible person to control the spread of the virus” Rupani said.


The CM added that the central government will decide on extending the lockdown but the state is preparing to put containment measures in place. “Our aim is ensure social distancing is maintained to check the spread of Covid-19,” he said.

On Tuesday, deputy CM Nitin Patel had also said that members of the Tablighi Jamaat played a major role in spreading coronavirus in the state and the country, by not cooperating with the authorities and hiding their travel history.

“Even in Islamic countries, including Pakistan, we have not heard of violations of the government’s instructions,” Patel had stated. “Unfortunately, in India, some radicals and religious fanatics spread a rumour that it would harm their religion.”

Patel had gone on to say: “After returning to their homes from Delhi, they should have informed the authorities. This could have contained the spread.” He had added: “If members of the jamaat had informed the authorities or come forward for medical check-ups, the quantum of spread would have been less. They should understand that their action mostly affected people from the minority community only.”
