LUCKNOW/AGRA: The number of foreign tourists coming to Nawabi era monuments has more than halved so far this month as compared to last year. As per the data maintained by Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT), 175 foreign tourists had visited Bara Imambara, Chhota Imambara, picture gallery and other monuments between March 1 to March 5, 2019, but just 88 foreigners visited these monuments this year. 


“We had booking of eight tourists from Hong Kong, but they cancelled their trip. Besides, a big group of 33 French tourists also cancelled their visit. A couple from United Kingdom, who wants to travel to the golden triangle, Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, is inquiring about the ground situation from us everyday,” said Prateek Hira, owner of a private tourism agency in Lucknow. “There is a fear because of coronavirus among tourists coming from abroad and more so now since cases have been detected in India too,” he added. 

The number of local tourists has also gone down from 16,451 in 2019 to 11,766 this year. 

“There are school examinations and Holi during this time, so local tourists dip. But this year, the coronavirus threat has decreased number of tourists, especially foreign ones,” said a guide wearing mask at Bara Imambara, requesting anonymity. 

Meanwhile, Agra administration started thermal screening of foreign tourists at Taj Mahal with hand-held devices on Thursday, even as the number of tourists has dipped. 

The screening is being done at the east gate parking area. 

CMO Dr Mukesh Kumar Vats said, “The health department bought six thermal guns to screen foreign tourists. It has an infrared sensor that can quickly measure temperature without making contact with a person’s skin.”

“Italian tourists, who checked-in at a city hotel on Thursday, were screened but did not have any symptoms of coronavirus,” Dr Vats told TOI.
