AURANGABAD: Police units across Marathwada have deployed drone cameras to keep an eye on those violating the lockdown norms.

This is for the first time in the region that drone cameras are being used to keep a check on errant citizens during a lockdown. According to the police, the footage from the cameras would not only be used to identify the violators, but will also be used as an irrefutable piece of evidence in the court of law.

Aurangabad rural police, led by superintendent of police Mokshada Patil, have deployed eight drone cameras in the jurisdiction. “Drones are deployed to ensure that nuisance-creating elements are watched, social distancing at weekly bazaars is supervised and mass movements are detected. It is a way of patrolling,” Patil said.

Beed police have deployed seven drone cameras in their jurisdiction. “It is a way to monitor movement of people in key areas,” SP Harssh Poddar said.

Aurangabad city police have deployed a couple of drone cameras and they have been specifically deployed in the areas that have reported maximum violation of lockdown in the past 10 days. Both Jalna and Nanded police have deployed one drone camera each.

Jalna superintendent of police S Chaitanya said that for the next 14 days of the lockdown the drones will continue to monitor the situation and the footage will be analysed later.
