Extra shifts at labs in West Bengal for more Covid-19 tests
2020-04-26
KOLKATA: The state health department is planning on operating extra shifts at the Covid-19 testing laboratories and is working on ways to enhance manpower at these facilities.


Heads of all medical colleges, hospitals, and district health administration heads have been asked to identify RT-PRC-trained lab technicians and make arrangements for their deployment at Covid labs.

“Increasing the shifts will help ramp up the facilities and enable us to test more samples and also deliver results faster. Moreover, it will enable the labs to operate at optimum capacity,” said a state health official. 

Currently, seven state-run laboratories are testing swab samples in addition to ICMR-NICED. While labs attached to SSKM, School of Tropical Medicine, RG Kar Hospital and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute are in the city, the rest — North Bengal Medical College, Midnapore Medical College and Malda Medical College — are in the districts. These labs are currently testing just 50-80 samples a day.

Apart from the government-run testing units, at least six more private labs in Kolkata have been allowed to conduct Covid tests.
