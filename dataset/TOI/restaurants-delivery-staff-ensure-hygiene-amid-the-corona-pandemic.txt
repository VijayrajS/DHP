Restaurants, delivery staff ensure hygiene amid the corona pandemic
2020-04-15
Most restaurants in the city that are open for home delivery have put in place strict hygiene procedures to ensure safety of staff and customers. From mandatory temperature check for staff to sanitising the kitchen every two hours, here’s a lowdown on what they are doing: 


Mandatory temperature check, handwashing, regular sanitisation of kitchen
Only a limited number of staff members are working at a time and inside the kitchen, they maintain a distance of at least 6ft from each other. Temperature check is also mandatory. "Our chefs have been staying in our premises since the lockdown began so that they don’t have to travel. They also do not have any contact with the delivery guys – the food is handed over by the chefs to the in-house staff, who then give it to the delivery boys," informs Rohit Arora of The Park in central Delhi. Sumit Gulati, a director of Spice Market in Saket, adds, "We do temperature checks before the staff enters the kitchen. They are provided with sanitised gloves, caps, masks and they are changed every few hours throughout the day. The staff has been instructed to wash hands every 20 minutes and use hand sanitisers." From door knobs to stove surfaces and counters, everything is sanitised with disinfectant every few hours in most kitchens. Mahabelly in Saket recently shut its kitchen because "it was becoming difficult to make sure that the deliveries we were getting from third party were safe," says Thomas Fenn of Mahabelly.


No-contact delivery
Be it food delivered through aggregators or by restaurant staff, contactless delivery is a must. Domino's Pizza says that restaurants, delivery bikes, boxes and hot bags are being sanitised every four hours. Most outlets have also stopped cash transactions. "We will continue our focus on contactless delivery, digital payments, sanitisation of delivery bags before every delivery and in providing tamper proof seal on every bag. Our delivery experts are trained in contactless delivery," says Vishal Jindal, director, Biryani By Kilo. 
A spokesperson from Swiggy adds, "Our delivery partners are being trained in WHO’s recommended practices. We are encouraging restaurant partners to implement strict safety guidelines like mandatory temperature checks for staff and delivery partners, sanitisation of kitchen space every four hours, use of masks, additional packaging for cooked food and provision of handwashing stations at pickup points."
