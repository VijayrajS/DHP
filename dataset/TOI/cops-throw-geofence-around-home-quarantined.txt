Cops throw ‘geofence’ around home quarantined
2020-05-17
Hubballi: With rising number of coronavirus patients and their contacts being kept in quarantine, the Hubballi-Dharwad police is now using geofencing technology to monitor their movements. Until now, the only fall-back police and health authorities had were neighbours who alerted them when those in home quarantine stepped out. Three people have already been booked for violating isolation directives. 

As of Friday, as many as 4,732 were under home isolation, district authorities said. 

Geofencing involves creating a virtual boundary around a specified location which triggers a response when it is breached. Depending on how it is configured, a breach may trigger text messages or alerts to the administrator. Variations of geofencing are used for marketing — such as in supermarkets and coffee shops, for instance, to push messages and ads to mobile phones in the area — and smart home appliances that trigger alerts when the user walks by.

“Since it is a sensitive issue, I will not reveal how it works. There are many methods and we are using one such method to track the movement of people in quarantine,” deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Krishnakanth said. “I would like to make it clear that those who are under mandatory isolation should not venture out. We are watching them constantly and a dedicated team has been deployed for this task. We will take strict action against those violating quarantine norms. We have already booked cases against three such people.”

The DCP added, “Beat police are also visiting the houses of those under home quarantine and requesting neighbours to keep a watch and alert us if they see any violation.”
