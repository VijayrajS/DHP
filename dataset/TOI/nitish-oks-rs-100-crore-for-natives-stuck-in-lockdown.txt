PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday released Rs100 crore from the CM Relief Fund (CMRF) for making food and stay arrangements for persons from Bihar who are trapped within or outside the state on account of the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. The same care would also be extended to those people from outside who are trapped in Bihar.

“The government will make arrangements to provide food and stay facility to persons from Bihar who are trapped at Patna or in any other town in the state as well as in other states due to the lockdown,” the CM said. “Nobody will be allowed to become a problem,” he said.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting attended by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, chief secretary Deepak Kumar, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey and disaster management department (DMD) principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit.

This is the second bunch of the ameliorative steps that the CM has announced in the last couple of days. The sum was released to the disaster relief fund (DRF) under the state’s DMD with a direction to all the 38 districts to create their own DRF with the fund provided to the department.

The fund is meant to take care of the rickshaw-pullers, daily wage and construction workers who have been rendered jobless due to the lockdown. “The government is making the food and stay arrangements at its own level,” the CM said, adding that “social distancing” norms would be followed in all these activities. 

The state’s resident commissioner at Delhi would coordinate with those states and the district administrations concerned to track the Biharis trapped and provide them food and stay facility. The governments of other states would also make suitable arrangements to address problems facing people from Bihar who are trapped there, the CM also said.
