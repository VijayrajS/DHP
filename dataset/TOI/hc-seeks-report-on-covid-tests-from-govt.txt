HC seeks report on Covid-19 tests from Telangana govt
2020-04-23
HYDERABAD: Refusing to compare the coronavirus situation in Telangana with Maharashtra or make any predictions about the spread of Covid-19 cases in the coming days, the high court on Wednesday sought a report from the government on the status of Covid-19 tests being carried out.


“Who knows what happens after two weeks? Nobody can predict such things,” said a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy while hearing apprehensions expressed by petitioner P Thirumala Rao, who urged the court to direct the state government to allow private hospitals to conduct Covid-19 tests. 

The petitioner, who is an advocate, said that Maharashtra has three times more Covid-19 cases than Telangana and expressed apprehensions whether the state-run hospitals alone can handle the situation if the number of cases in Telangana also rise in a rapid manner. Refusing to get into these prediction games, the bench said, “We may even reach the stage of Kerala where the coronavirus curve has flattened. The figures cannot be predicted.”

The manpower available with the state government may not be sufficient, the petitioner said. To this, advocate general BS Prasad said the state-run hospitals along with their doctors and staff have been doing a commendable job in handling the virus cases.
