According to the health department, the 27-year-old patient worked at an upscale luxury hotel in Mumbai for the past several years and had returned home to Rishikesh last week.

However, he developed some symptoms of the infection upon reaching his home in Rishikesh and visited our OPD on Saturday to have his sample taken. He was found positive later that night,” said Harish Thapliyal from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh.
