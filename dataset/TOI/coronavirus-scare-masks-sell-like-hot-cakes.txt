Coronavirus scare: Masks sell like hot cakes in Bengaluru
2020-02-02
BENGALURU: With the coronavirus scare gripping the city, panicky Bengalureans are knocking on the doors of pharmacists seeking to buy masks to prevent being infected. Though no positive cases of coronavirus infection have been seen in the city, chemists confirmed the spike in sale of masks. 


It may be recalled that the guidelines issued by the Centre, as a preventive measure, mention the usage of handkerchiefs or masks to maintain cough hygiene. In Singapore, which has reported three confirmed cases of coronavirus, the government has decided to issue four masks to every family. 

Mahesh G, proprietor of Yasho Pharmacy near Residency Road, said the sale of masks in his shop has gone up due to the panic surrounding coronavirus. “Not everyone who buys a mask may be using it the right way. People are just buying masks and keeping them. This is panic buying, which was seen earlier during outbreak of respiratory infections like H1N1,” he said. 

He added that a month ago he was selling not more than 20-22 masks a day, and over the past three or four days, the number has crossed 200. 

Masks are available from Rs 5 to Rs 300 a piece. N-95 masks are available at Rs 40 each and are the most sought-after. However, the well-known 3M N-95 masks are unavailable in most shops. 

Confirming the rampant sale of masks, president of All India Druggists Association’s Bengaluru chapter, MK Mayanna, said the price has doubled for clinical masks. “What was sold at Rs 5 now costs for Rs 10 owing to shortage,” he said. 

According to Dr Anoop Amarnath, chief of clinical services, Manipal Hospitals, wearing a mask is only one of the precautions to prevent infections. “Importance should also be given to other preventive aspects like washing hands, staying away from an infected person and maintaining cough hygiene,” he said.
