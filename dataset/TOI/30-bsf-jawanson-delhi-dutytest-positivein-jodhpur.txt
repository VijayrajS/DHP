JAISALMER/JODHPUR: As many as 30 BSF jawans, who were on duty in Jama Masjid area of Delhi recently, tested positive for Covid-19 in Jodhpur on Wednesday. Around 57 jawans of the BSF reserve battalion, who had gone from Jaipur to Delhi, were called back to Jodhpur on suspicion of being infected.

The battalion was deputed in Jama Masjid area after the Tablighi Jamaat fiasco came to light. The jawans were assisting Delhi police in maintaining law and order. However, after three Delhi police jawans tested positive, the paramilitary force called back its 57 jawans to BSF’s Subsidiary Training Centre (STC) in Jodhpur.

Samples of all the jawans were taken on Tuesday and 30 of them tested positive on Wednesday.

All the infected jawans have been admitted to AIIMS Jodhpur, while the rest have been quarantined at the STC.

“Samples of 44 jawans were taken after their arrival in Jodhpur on Tuesday and were sent to AIIMS for examination. The report was released by AIIMS on Wednesday morning. Thirty samples tested positive,” said a BSF official, adding that test reports of 13 samples were awaited.

According to sources, the jawans came to Jodhpur by bus on Tuesday. A few of them were admitted to the hospital at the BSF frontier headquarters premises after their health started deteriorating.

BSF Rajasthan frontier IG Amit Lodha said that no other jawan at the local level in Jodhpur has been infected and an advisory has been issued for preventing the spread. BSF STC commanding officer V S Rathore said the BSF premises in Jodhpur has been sealed and a 300-bed quarantine centre has been readied.

Meanwhile, six BSF companies from Jaisalmer, which had been deployed at Jammu and Kashmir at the time of abrogating Section 370, have now been sent to Gujarat to extend help in maintaining law and order.
