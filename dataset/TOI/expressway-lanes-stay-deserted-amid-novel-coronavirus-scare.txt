PUNE: The traffic on Pune-Mumbai Expressway has declined by over 40% in the past three days in the wake of the Covid-19 spread.


Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) superintendent of police Milind Mohite confirmed the decline in the number of vehicles on the expressway in last three days owing to the rise in Covid-19 cases. 

“People have opted to stay at home instead of travelling,” he said.

Around 35,000 to 40,000 vehicles used the expressway daily to commute between Mumbai and Pune, Mohite said. 

“Now, only 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles are using the expressway,” he said.

Mohite said a majority of the vehicles using the expressway were heading towards Mumbai. “I took stock of the situation and found that very few cars were travelling in between the two cities. The trucks were mainly from Pune, Satara, Kolhapur and other southern states,” he added.

A senior Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) official in Pune told TOI, “Yes, there has been a reduction in the number of vehicles on the expressway and we are collecting information about it from the maintenance agency manning the toll and expressway.” HSP officials have appealed to commuters to avoid speeding on the empty lanes of the expressway.
