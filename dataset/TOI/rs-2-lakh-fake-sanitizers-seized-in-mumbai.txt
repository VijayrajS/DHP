MUMBAI: FDA carried out raids between Wednesday and Thursday on companies making fake sanitisers that offered no real germ-killing properties. The teams found that several herbal products have flooded the market. 


In one case, FDA seized a stock of fake sanitisers worth over Rs 2 lakh from a Kandivli distributor, Riddhi Siddhi. On investigation, the drug regulatory body found that the sanitisers were manufactured by a Bhiwandi company that had surrendered its licence two years back.

"We found that the company was making sanitisers illegally and selling it to distributors and chemists. They have violated the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and will be penalised accordingly, but since they have cooperated with police, an FIR may not be lodged," said D R Gahane, FDA assistant commissioner (drugs). 

He said the sanitisers were sold under the names of Biotol Cosmetics and Wiz. "They were complete fakes and the companies were not making them," he added.

The FDA teams also came across another Vakola firm, Sanskar Ayurved, that was manufacturing fake products. Sold under the name of Safe Hands, the product claimed it was anti-bacterial. The bottle also carried a helpline number which did not work.
