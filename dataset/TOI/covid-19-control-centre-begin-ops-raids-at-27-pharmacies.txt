HYDERABAD: In tune with the state government’s continuing efforts to control coronavirus, the Command and Control Centre that was set up to control the disease began operations in the city on Friday. 


The state health minister, Etela Rajender visited the centre at the office of the director of public health. He also had a telephonic interaction with the state’s sole coronavirus patient who is at the isolation ward at Gandhi hospital and enquired about his well-being. “The patient is stable and we are hopeful that he will be discharged soon,” said Rajender.


 
Rajender also announced the formation of five special committees in the wake of the first positive case. Discussions were held to outline the roles of the committees that will help manage the treatment of Covid-19 cases. IAS officers Manick Raj and TK Sridevi were appointed to head one committee each.

The state drug control authorities (DCA) raided 27 medical shops on Friday to check if the masks were sold in the market at a price above maximum retail price. 

Rajender said that strict action would be taken against those selling masks at a higher rate in the state. DCA asked drug inspectors to be extra vigilant to prevent black marketing, illegal hoarding or overcharging of 58 types of medicines imported from China, in addition to masks and sanitizers.

Meanwhile, the 12-member team, headed by Dr Shravan Kumar, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital, that is currently in Kerala to understand the containment efforts of the state, met with experts from Kerala Medical Board. 

Following the Centre’s directive to avoid mass gathering, the state wing of Indian Medical Association said that measures should be taken to prevent public gatherings.
