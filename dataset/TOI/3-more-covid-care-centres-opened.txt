Indore: Indore district administration on Tuesday started three more Covid Care Centres to cater to increasing number of asymptomatic patients. With this, the city has now total eight Covid Care Centres.

Nodal officer Vivek Shrotriya said that 35 patients were admitted in Robert Nursing Home, 22 in Sewakunj, 81 in President, 21 in TCL and 35 in Water Lily Garden. “Sewakunj hospital has a capacity to keep 400 patients, while the administration is also exploring to convert another facility into Covid Care Centre to keep around 120 people there” he said. On Tuesday, the administration received a guideline from ministry of health and family welfare for asymptomatic patients to opt for home isolation, if they have requisite facility to remain isolated from other family members. “There are many patients of Covid-19, who are asymptomatic or having mild symptoms. They will have to give an affidavit that he/she has chosen home isolation voluntarily and will follow guidelines and remain in surveillance of health officers,” Shotriya said.

Indore administration is preparing a mobile-based application for patients, who will opt for home isolation, to log in and provide required details on regular basis for monitoring by health department. Isolation period at home will end only if symptoms are clinically resolved and surveillance medical officer certifies him to be free of infection after lab test. TNN
