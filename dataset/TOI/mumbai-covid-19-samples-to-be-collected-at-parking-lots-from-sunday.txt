MUMBAI: BMC plans sample collection for suspected Covid-19 patients at public parking lots (PPLs) in the city from Sunday. The PPLs are in areas like Byculla, Sewri, Parel, Dadar, Mulund, Borivli, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli.


Laboratories like Thyrocare Technologies, SRL Ltd, InfeXn Laboratories and Metropolis Healthcare Ltd will undertake the drive. The labs will have to submit daily reports to the medical health officer and ward concerned, and approach the ward officer for disposal of biomedical waste.

A BMC official said each of the labs would test around 200 suspected patients, so at all the 17 PPLs approximately 3,000 tests can be conducted.

“Ward officers must bring residents from their wards, who are in home or institutional quarantine, and get them tested at the facilities. The charge for the test will be Rs3,500 if the kit is not provided by BMC. For kits provided by BMC, the charge will be Rs1,500,” said a civic official.

The wards also need to have a car ready for the purpose. “Sample collection can be discreetly done and the patient need not come out of the car. This can eliminate chances of cross-infection,” added the official.
