RANCHI: The rise in the number of new Covid-19 cases continued to remain low for the third day with Jharkhand recording four fresh cases — three of them from Ranchi— on Thursday. However, Godda became the 12th of 24 districts in the state to be affected by the virus as the tribal dominated district reported its first case.

Meanwhile, a patient from Bokaro has recovered from the disease. The state’s coronavirus tally now stands at 110, of which 88 are active. Two patients have died and 20 have recovered.

State health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni that Covid-19 death rate in the state is very low and they are enforcing the lockdown strictly across all 33 containment zones in state. “We have a death rate of less than 2.8%, way lesser than the national average. To strengthen critical care infrastructure, we have arranged a total of 206 beds with ventilator facilities,” he said.

Ranchi SDM Lokesh Mishra said: “Of the three new cases, two are from Hindpiri and one is a staff at RIMS.” The two from Hindpiri are women in their mid-20s and one of them is pregnant. The third is a male aged 44 who works with the microbiology department at Rims.

During a press conference earlier in the day, Kulkarni said they have classified all 24 districts in red, orange and green category as per Centre’s guidelines. “Ranchi has been designated as a red zone, nine districts are orange zone and 14 are green category. Orange districts will become green if they do not report any new cases for 21 days,” he said.

On being asked about strengthening of the testing infrastructure, Kulkarni said: “Three new labs are being set up at our medical colleges in Palamu, Dumka and Hazaribag. We are also working on getting accreditation for private labs that have the necessary infrastructure.”
