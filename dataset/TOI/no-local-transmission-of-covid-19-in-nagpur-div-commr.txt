Nagpur: Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, on Saturday, made it clear that there is no local transmission of Covid-19 in any pocket of Nagpur so far. 

He rejected the report by a leading news agency in which it was claimed that government has changed testing strategy after 10 samples out of 1,300 tested in some pockets of Nagpur were found positive.

“It’s wrong. Only four positive cases were reported in Nagpur at the beginning. Later, even after testing about 250 samples, not even a single positive case has been reported so far,” Kumar said.

The divisional commissioner appealed to people not to trust rumours and continue to follow social distancing. He claimed that the government is well-prepared and arrangements for quarantine can be made for 4,000 people in Nagpur alone.

As per the data provided by the district collector, 35 samples were received on Saturday which takes the total number of suspects tested in Nagpur till date to 247. Currently, 63 persons are in the quarantine facility at MLA Hostel while 729 persons are in home quarantine.
