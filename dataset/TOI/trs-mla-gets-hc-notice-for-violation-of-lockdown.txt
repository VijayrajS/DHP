TRS MLA gets HC notice for violation of lockdown
2020-05-22
Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Thursday issued notice to TRS MLA M Bhupal Reddy of Narayankhed, asking him to explain his stand on a PIL that questioned a birthday party hosted at the MLA’s residence on May 7, ignoring the lockdown norms. Notices were also served on the state government, Sangareddy district collector and district SP.

M Vittal, a social activist, filed the PIL seeking action against the MLA contending that through his actions, he had endangered the lives of scores of people during this pandemic. 

His counsel, D Raghavendar Rao, told a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy that despite Sangareddy district falling in orange zone and congregations of more than 20 not being allowed, the MLA went ahead and celebrated his 61st birthday with more than 500 people.

Most of them did not wear masks, Vittal said. To a query from the bench as to what are the penal provisions that deal with such lockdown norms’ violations, the counsel replied that section 51 (b) of the National Disaster Management Act prescribes one-year jail term to such violations and the term may increase to two years if such violations result in the death of people.

The bench sought replies from the authorities and posted the case to three weeks.
