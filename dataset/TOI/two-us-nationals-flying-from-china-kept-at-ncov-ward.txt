PANAJI: Two US nationals have been quarantined at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital as suspected cases of coronavirus, GMC dean Shivanand Bandekar said on Saturday. 


“A 27-year-old, foreign female suspect working in China, travelled to Bengaluru on January 20, and then arrived in Goa on January 27 along with her friend who is asymptomatic. Samples of both persons have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. The suspect only has history of fever with upper respiratory tract infection,” health minister Vishwajit Rane said.

Sources said when the female got fever, she approached a private hospital for treatment, and when it was brought to the notice of the doctors at the private hospital that she travelled to Goa from China, the doctors and the private hospital immediately informed the health authorities. Sources said her friend did not show fever symptoms. Later, they were shifted to GMC after taking all precautions.

Two more persons were brought under observation on Friday as they had visited China. This is in addition to the six persons whose health is being monitored after they returned from China. As part of the all-India surveillance measures, the Goa airport has started screening passengers since Thursday night. 

The state government had also sought for scanners to be installed at the airport.
