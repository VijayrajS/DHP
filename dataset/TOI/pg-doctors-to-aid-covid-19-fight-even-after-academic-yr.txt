2020-04-22
HYDERABAD: Final year post graduate medical students in the state might have to continue providing their services beyond this academic year which concludes in May, this year if the Covid-19 curve does not flatten. While the Centre has already issued orders to a few medical universities across the country regarding it, Telangana will follow suit by extending services of PG students by a month or two, depending on the situation in the state.


The central order has asked several universities to extend services of final year PG students by two months keeping in mind the Covid-19 crisis.“It has been decided that the services of post graduate students as residents will be utilized with full pay/ stipend, until a fresh batch of undergraduates have joined physically, to ensure that there is no shortage of residents in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. Also concerned medical institutions should ensure availability of accommodation for such candidates,” read the order issued by the Directorate of General Health Services, Government of India. 

Examinations of PG students in the state have been postponed due to the pandemic. However, the admission process for first year students had started. Students have mostly reported online and not in person due to the lockdown. “The last date of joining for Telangana is May 31. So all the third year students will be completing their course by then. But if the need arises, we will be extending the service.,” said Dr Karunakar Rao, vice-chancellor, Kalolji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences, Telangana.
