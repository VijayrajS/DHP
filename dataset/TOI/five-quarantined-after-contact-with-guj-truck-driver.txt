PONDA: Following the confirmatory test of the Gujarat-based truck driver at Goa Medical College Bambolim for coronavirus, five persons, including three operators of a Ponda dhaba (road side eatery) and two workers of a transport company have been quarantined at the Ponda sub district hospital on Thursday as they came in direct contact with the truck driver on Wednesday. 


The driver had reportedly had his meals at the dhaba located along the Bethora-Borim Bypass Road , where the truck was parked for the last two days after the driver had unloaded his goods at a transport company in Ponda on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday morning, the driver was shifted to the Ponda sub district hospital after he developed fever and complaints of uneasiness. Ascertaining his travel history, the medical officers at the hospital conducted the TrueNet Screening test on the driver, which showed he was positive for the virus. 

Following the test result, his blood sample was sent to GMC for the Real Time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, which also came positive, confirming his Covid-19 infection.

At the same time, six who travelled together in a vehicleâ€” a family of five people, including a one-year-old baby, and their driver, also tested positive for the virus and were referred to the ESI Hospital in Margao early Thursday morning. Local authorities in Ponda, supervised by deputy collector Kedar Naik and Ponda PI Mohan Gaude, arranged for the truck and the dhaba to be sanitised on Thursday, to prevent the spread of the virus.
