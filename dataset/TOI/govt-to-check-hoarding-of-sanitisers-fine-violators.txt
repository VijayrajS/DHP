Since hand sanitisers have been declared as essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, action can be taken against dealers involved in hoarding and black-marketing of the product. The retailer/ manufacturer/ trader overcharging a consumer can be prosecuted under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, and Packaged Commodities Rules, 2011, the government said in a statement.

Hussain reviewed the compliance of the ‘packaged commodity rules’ by chemists, retailers, shopkeepers, manufacturers and traders with regard to the sale of face masks, surgical masks, hand sanitisers and other essential items and medicines used for control and prevention of the spread of novel coronavirus. Senior officers of the legal metrology department were also present at the meeting.

Officials said the legal metrology department has been tasked to educate customers to carefully check mandatory declarations on packaged commodities such as the net quantity, month and year of manufacturing or pre-packing and MRP (inclusive of all taxes) before buying a product.
