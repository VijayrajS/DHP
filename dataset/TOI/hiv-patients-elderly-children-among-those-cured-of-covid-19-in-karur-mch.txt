Trichy: With the distinction of curing the oldest Covid-19 patient, a 95-year-old Dindigul woman, Karur government medical college hospital has been marching ahead in the fight against the pandemic by curing many comorbid patients. Apart from elderly people, several pregnant women and even HIV patients figure among the 209 Covid-19 positive people who were treated successfully at the hospital so far.

The hospital which caters to Covid-19 positive cases in Karur, Dindigul and Namakkal districts has witnessed a total of 236 cases but witnessed only one death, that of a 96-year-old man from Dindigul who was suffering from age-related ailments. Two patients who were People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLHA) under antiretroviral therapy (ART) were also treated successfully for Covid-19. Medical college dean Dr E Theranirajan said one of them was a 36-year-old man and the other a 54-year-old woman, both of who were high risk patients. 

The hospital had taken a slew of measures to keep patients mentally sound and roped in psychologists to counsel the patients. They proved effective in counselling anti-natal mothers as well as mothers of new born babies who had contracted the disease. A woman from Namakkal who showed signs of depression for being away from her newborn was effectively counselled. It was challenging to prevent a possible infection to a newborn from a Covid-19 positive mother without separating the duo, said Dr Theranirajan.

It has been proven that the baby will not get infection from breast milk but the mother had to be kept at a distance. Therefore, the baby received breast milk ‘expressed’ from themother’s breast and the idea worked, he said. The hospital also treated eleven children who had the infection, from as young as five months to as old as 11 years.
