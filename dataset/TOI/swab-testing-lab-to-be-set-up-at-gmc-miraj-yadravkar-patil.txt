KOLHAPUR: A laboratory will soon be opened at the Government Medical College (GMC) at Miraj in the neighbouring Sangli district for testing swab samples of coronavirus suspects.


Minister of state for health Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar visited the quarantine wards and checked the preparations of the health administration to fight against the spread of coronavirus. As of now, no confirmed case of coronavirus has been reported in the district.

Currently, the facility to collect swab samples from the suspects is being operated at the GMC. The samples are then sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. As of now, samples of only 10 suspects of the total 265 screened have been sent for testing.

Of the 10, four have tested negative while six were rejected stating the people do not have symptoms or travel history to the countries affected by Covid-19. The health officials, too, are of the view that the number of tests done so far are much less than expected.

“The next phase of coronavirus spread is critical. We have decided to set up the testing labs at several places in the state. One of which will be opened at Miraj which will be helpful to increase the number of tests carried out. Private doctors have assured us to assist in all possible ways to stop the spread of coronavirus.”

District collector Daulat Desai has appealed to the people with travel history to the affected countries to home quarantine for 14 days. The health staff is visiting the home quarantined suspects.

Desai has also ordered the civic bodies and rural administration to reach out to people arriving from the other cities as well where cases if coronavirus have been reported.

The number of home quarantined suspects is currently at 223, up from 170 reported on Tuesday. The number of suspects completed 14-day home quarantine area 42 while number of people with a travel history traced on Wednesday was 56.
