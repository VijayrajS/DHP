PIL against Uttarakhand government order allowing schools to ask for fees during lockdown
2020-04-27
DEHRADUN: The National Association of Parents and Student Rights (NAPSR) has filed a PIL in Uttarakhand High Court against the state government’s recent decision to lift the regulation that banned schools from asking for fees during the lockdown period.


The members of the association claim that several local private schools are taking undue advantage of this particular order and are forcing parents to pay their ward’s fees during the lockdown period.

“The government’s order (dated April 22) to lift the ban on schools from asking for fees during the lockdown has led to many private schools pressurising parents despite the fact that many people are struggling financially during this lockdown period. The government had stated very clearly that no school will increase fees in this financial year but several schools have hiked it by a significant margin. Many schools are even asking for transportation and computer charges even as the children are not going to schools due to the lockdown,” said Arif Khan, president of NAPSR.

The official added, “We have received several complaints from the parents and they have even shared screenshots of messages from school officials asking for the monthly fees and in some cases, advance fees too. We have also observed that many schools don’t toe their line in spite of being served with notices from the education department. Therefore, it was important to move to the high court,” said Arif Khan, president of NAPSR.

Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand Rajya Andolankari Manch, a social organisation, has also expressed its discontent with the government’s order and has alleged that several private schools have either increased their fees or are asking for fee payments from the parents with immediate effect.
