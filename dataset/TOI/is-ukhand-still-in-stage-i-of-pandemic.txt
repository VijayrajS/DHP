Is Uttarakhand still in Stage-I of pandemic?
2020-03-28
DEHRADUN: A day after the state government claimed that the Covid-19 pandemic in Uttarakhand has been restricted to Stage-I with five positive cases (all with a history of travelling abroad) been found in the state till now, medical experts say that this may not necessarily be the case. With only 350 people tested in Uttarakhand till March 27, the experts say that more testing is required to get the accurate picture, considering that there has been an influx of foreign travellers in the Himalayan state in the first week of March for yoga events as well as a large number of people returning to their villages from cities like Delhi and Mumbai, where there is a significant outbreak of Covid-19, and no mechanism deployed to test them.


Dr Sunil Sanon, Mussoorie-based physician who provides voluntary medical services in the villages of Garwhal, told TOI, “Ghar Wapsi (Homecoming) of the men of the hills working outside the state may cost dear to the health authorities who are neglecting this large influx of people returning to their homes after the lockdown. Many of them returned to their homes as early as in the first week of March and managed to reach the hills unchecked. I have written to both health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and PM Modi highlighting this issue.”

Another senior doctor from AIIMS Rishikesh who didn’t wish to be named, added that it is important that the government does more testing in order to arrive at conclusive figures. “At present, only people who have a history of travelling abroad and those who came in contact with identified Covid-19-positive patients are being tested. The government needs to test more, considering that the three forest service trainees and the man who was found positive in Kotdwar were not showing many symptoms when they were diagnosed as Covid-19-positive.”
