‘Extend lockdown till May’
2020-04-13
Thiruvananthapuram: IMA-Kerala vice-president Dr N Sulphi said the lockdown should continue till May to check the spread of Covid-19. He was speaking at the Facebook live organized by The Times of India here. The three-day series, which was attended by experts in medical sector, concluded on Sunday.

Dr Sulphi said maintaining social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing of masks should continue for months even after the lockdown.

“The medical fraternity expects that the threat of Covid-19 would continue for 2-3 years, but for the general public, it is a matter of 2-3 months. Just how we contained spread of H1N1, Covid-19 would emerge as a normal viral disease in the future. We will be able to develop an effective vaccine for it within two years,” he said.

Regarding developing herd immunity, Dr Sulphi said though herd immunity is good, the state could not afford to wait till 60% of the population develops the immunity. “Countries such as Italy and the UK which waited for it had to witness a huge number of fatalities,” he said.

Considering the cases of recovered persons getting infected again, Dr Sulphi said there is a possibility of a second peak. “Definitely, it is not a time to relax. However, people don’t have to be anxious about indefinite lockdown restrictions. Even the social distancing need not be practised after six months. If everything goes well, we will have a grand Onam celebration this year,” he said.

The doctor said upcoming monsoon season will be a challenge as the season is more conducive for virus spread. “Now we are able to limit number of people visiting hospital, except for emergency cases. But there will be pre-monsoon rains by mid-May, which will be followed by a viral outbreak. If there is rise in such cases, hospitals and health workers will not be able to manage,” he said.
