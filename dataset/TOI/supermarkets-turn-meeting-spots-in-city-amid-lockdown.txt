Supermarkets turn meeting spots in city amid lockdown
2020-05-03
Hyderabad: Thanks to the lockdown, friends and family members are planning reunions at the most unlikeliest of places supermarkets across the city. These stores have turned new meeting points for people, who have been cooped up at home for the past few weeks.

“I have not met my friends for over a month. So I planned to meet them at a supermarket in Banjara Hills. That way we could shop as well as meet each other,” said Radhika Rao (name changed). “We took all precautions such as wearing masks as we spent time together,” she said. 

Not just friends, stores have also become hot spots for those dating. “My parents would not allow my girlfriend to come out and meet me, so we decided to catch up on the pretext of shopping for essentials at a supermarket in Himayath Nagar,” said Akshay Reddy (name changed). 

While some say this personal touch would help beat the ‘stay-at-home-blues’, others feel this is developing into a dangerous trend that must be nipped in the bud. “I have noticed many people planning to meet at stores. This is leading to overcrowding at some outlets,” said Harish Daga, a city-based activist.

Citing an example at Rajendranagar, Harish said that he overheard people who had planned to meet at a grocery outlet. “Since early morning, hoards of people gathered there and there was no social distance maintained which can be quite dangerous in this pandemic situation,” he said. 

Many fear that the new trend many result in the spread of infection.Another resident Ramesh Reddy, who lives in AS Rao Nagar, said: “Just the other day I noticed a get-together by a couple of men at a store in our area. When I went and confronted them, they just said they were speaking for a moment. What they do not realise is all it takes is a little time to catch or spread the infection.”
