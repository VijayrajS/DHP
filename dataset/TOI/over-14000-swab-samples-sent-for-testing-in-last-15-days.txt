PUNE: The number of swabs collected for Covid-19 testing has doubled in the Pune Metropolitan Region in the last 15 days, with over 14,000 samples being collected since the beginning of May days as against 13,973 in the 52 days till April 29.


This was revealed in the data released by the district health office. It showed that till May 14, as many as 27,981 swab samples were sent for testing in comparison to 13,973 samples that were sent till April 29 after the first two cases of Covid-19 were detected in Pune on March 9. 

The PMR has so far recorded the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state after Mumbai, with Pune municipal limits being the worst-affected, followed by the rural areas. The central teams constituted to monitor the measures taken by the government machinery in PMR had recommended to boost the surveillance, contact tracing, collection of swabs and testing. 

Officials from PMC’s health department said the increase in swab collection and testing was a vital part of containment plan, besides other steps like rigorous contact tracing and implementation of stricter lockdown measures in the micro-clusters. “The swab collection has increased from the beginning of May and daily average has now reached around 1,000. For instance, 1,414 samples were collected on May 14, 1,205 on May 13 and 989 on May 12 in the PMC limits. All high- and low-risk contacts, symptomatic patients have been under close watch,” a PMC health official said. 

A few days ago, the divisional commissioner had held a meeting of the health officials, private laboratories and hospitals to discuss steps to increase swab testing.
