KOLHAPUR: A local court in Jaysingpur convicted two people for breaking home-quarantine rules and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for a month.


The court also slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 on each of them, failing which both will have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven more days. Police said that the conviction of the duo would serve as an example for other people who violate home-qurantine rules and make them stay at home. 

The court, presided over by judicial magistrate first class A B Redkar, convicted Nikhil Mohan Kalse (28) and Ganesh Kumbhar (34) under sections 279 and 280 of the IPC for violating home-quarantine rules. 

As per the court order, despite being given the stamp of home-quarantine, the accused wilfully disobeyed directions of the health authority. While Kalse was arrested on March 28, Kumbhar was nabbed on March 30 by the respective police stations in Jaysingpur division.

Kishor Kale, deputy superintendent of police, Jaysingpur said, “Even after the two were advised home-quarantine, they were found loitering on the streets and violating quarantine rules. Hence, we registered cases against them and produced them in court.”

Kolhapur police have registered cases against as many as 134 people for violating quarantine rules. The cases are registered with various police stations in the district.

“The concerned police officers are doing the documentation work of these cases and are in the process of taking these cases to the respective courts. The cases will come up for hearing soon, depending on the workload of the respective police stations,” said a senior police officer.
