MANGALURU: Tension prevailed at Darandabagilu in Pilar near Thokkottu on Friday after police and health workers arrived to shift a 15-year-old boy to Covid-19 hospital. 

Residents of Pilar in Someshwara Town Municipality in Mangaluru taluk were taken by surprise when they saw police and health workers arriving with an ambulance to shift the boy. Though health officials had communicated about the boy’s throat swab testing positive to his parents, neighbours were startled to see the child being taken alone in an ambulance. 

In fact, Pilar area was declared as a containment zone after a woman (P-947) tested positive on May 13. As many as 430 people residing in 95 houses in the area were forced to stay inside the containment area. Later, the area’s status was changed after the woman was cured and discharged on May 27. 

Residents, who were already annoyed with the restrictions these days due to containment, raised objections when officials arrived. They questioned police and health officials for taking the boy alone in the ambulance. Later, Dakshina Kannada ZP member Dhanalaxmi Gatti convinced residents and helped health department staff shift the boy to the designated hospital – District Wenlock Hospital. 

Though the boy was tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, neither the state nor the district bulletin made mention of the case. In fact, both bulletins showed no positive cases in Dakshina Kannada district while Udupi recorded 15 cases. 

District health and family welfare officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy told TOI that the boy was a secondary contact of P-947. He said the boy’s case will be mentioned in Saturday’s bulletin since reports were sent twice a day.
