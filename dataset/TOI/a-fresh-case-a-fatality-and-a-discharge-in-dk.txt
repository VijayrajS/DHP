2020-05-14
MANGALURU: The Covid-19 arc did a complete circle in Dakshina Kannada on Wednesday, with a fresh case being reported, a patient being discharged after effecting a successful recovery and one person succumbing to the infection. The number of active cases in the coastal district now stands at 16. As many as six patients who were not residents of Dakshina Kannada, but were treated here, have all recovered and have been discharged.

A 38-year-old woman, a primary contact of an infected patient traced to the First Neuro Hospital in Padil, was confirmed with Covid-19 by Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh. The woman in question is a resident of Pilar in Someshwar village in Mangaluru taluk. Following the development, the DC designated Pilar, with a population of 430 a ‘containment zone’. 

It was around 3pm on Wednesday that the death of a 58-year-old woman from Bolar was confirmed. The woman, who had been suffering from TB meningitis had undergone treatment at the Padil hospital between April 10 and April 17. DC Sindhu said that her condition had remained critical, and she had kept in the ICU at the Wenlock Hospital since her admission. 

However, the discharge of a Bantwal resident having been discharged helped dispel some of the gloom that the other tidings had cast on the day in Dakshina Kannada.
