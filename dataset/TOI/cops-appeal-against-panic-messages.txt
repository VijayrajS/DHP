Police have also appealed to residents not to disclose names and details of the patients on social networking sites.

Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam said people should not spread rumours. “Fake messages are being spread on social media sites, especially on an internet-based phone messaging service. It has also been found that people are circulating names and addresses of patients. We appeal to people not to spread rumours and not to disclose names and details of the patients on social media sites.”

Kadam warned that the police could file cases against people spreading rumours on social media sites. Such action will be under Section 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code. People prosecuted for such offence can face prison term up to three years on conviction.
