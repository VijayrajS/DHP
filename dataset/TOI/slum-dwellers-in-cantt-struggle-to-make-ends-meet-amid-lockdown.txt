Slum-dwellers in Cantt struggle to make ends meet amid lockdown
2020-03-30
Secunderabad: As the lockdown has brought daily life to a standstill, residents of over a 100 slums in Secunderabad Cantonment areas are struggling to make ends meet. Most of the 5,000 families staying in the eight civilian wards in the Cantonment areas are daily-wage earners, domestic helpers, construction and sanitation workers. 

Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) of nearly 300 colonies have been told by their employers to stay home. “I used to earn of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per month, now who will take care of us?” said K Nagamma (38), a domestic helper and resident of Indiramma Nagar in Rasoolpura.

Durgaiah (28), a daily wager, said the SCB staff and local ward members have failed to help him during the crisis. “The state government had announced it will supply rice, oil and dal through fair price shops, but in the Cantonment, the officials concerned are not implementing this. I have five family members to feed,” he said. 

Several families in slums also said SCB officials were only making announcements on preventive measures rather than providing them essential items.
