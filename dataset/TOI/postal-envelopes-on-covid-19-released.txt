2020-05-09
COIMBATORE: To laud the selfless performance of Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers who have been working in the frontline of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the Coimbatore postal division on Friday released another set of postal envelopes with a franking slogan.

The 300 envelopes in presentation packs have been imprinted with ‘To stop Covid-19, flatten the curve’ and the epidemic curve. 

Each presentation pack consist of a Rs 5 commercially used postal envelop and Rs 5 commemorative stamp on Mahatma Gandhi and cancelled by the date stamp impressions of the R S Puram head office.

The cost of the presentation pack is Rs 170. They will be available for sale at the Philatelic Bureau at Good Shed Road Post Office.

The envelopes are expected to be part of philatelic collections. “Franking is used instead of stamps. It mentions the stamp value it replaces, the name of the post office and has a special die on the corona theme,” said senior superintendent of post offices Sudhir Gopal Jakhere. 

This is the third philatelic product released by the division with the Covid-19 theme.
