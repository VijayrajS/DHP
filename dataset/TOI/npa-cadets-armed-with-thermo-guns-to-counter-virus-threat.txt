NPA cadets armed with thermo guns to counter virus threat
2020-06-14
Hyderabad: SVP National Police Academy (SVPNPA) 2018 cadets who are otherwise supposed to be training with actual guns, are now mandated to use a different gun on a regular basis - the thermo gun.

Each of the 137 cadets were given a thermo gun and are mandated to record their body temperature on a regular basis during their ongoing quarantine stay in SVPNPA campus. 

This measure was one of the several preventive measures which were taken by the academy, keeping in view that two of its cadets tested positive for Covid-19. If any of the trainee IPS officers shows signs of fever, such as an increase in temperature during their temperature check-up, they are expected to immediately report to the academy authorities. 

As a precautionary measure, the academy officials have allocated accommodation to all the 137 cadets in the guest house, which is on a hillock inside the academy, to avoid them coming contact with areas where the academy staff will be present. 

“The online classes are already in progress. Even the two cadets who tested positive are attending the classes while being in quarantine. We asked all the cadets to self record their temperature and keep us informed in case of fever,” a senior SPVNPA officer told TOI. 

The cadets who tested positive, had contracted coronavirus while they were in District Practical Training (DPT) recently at their cadre allotted states. As a result, when the 2018 batch cadets reported to academy, all of them were tested for Covid-19.
