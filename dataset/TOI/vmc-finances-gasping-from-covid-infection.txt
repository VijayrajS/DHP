VMC finances gasping from Covid infection
2020-05-22
Vadodara: With expenses of the civic body surpassing its revenue in April this year, cash-strapped Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is almost staring at a financial crisis owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. 

Relying heavily on octroi grant provided by the state government to compensate for the octroi tax that has been abolished, VMC has to walk the tight rope with its limited sources of revenue. Finances were further hit in April when the civic body collected Rs 6.75 crore and spent around Rs 85 crore.

In April last year, the civic body had collected revenue amounting to Rs 29 crore from various sources. Officials pointed out that the civic body was struggling with its revenues as income from sources like building permissions, various taxes and charges as well as other sources had completely dried up.

An official said that several expenses that totalled to around Rs 85 crore per month remained unchanged. These include expenses like salary and pension, operation and maintenance cost as well as electricity and other bills. 

The only sources that are contributing to the civic bodyâ€™s earnings these days are interest, rent, some income towards pending taxes as well as other minor heads.

The opposition in the elected wing of VMC has already raised the issue with the state government. 

Former deputy mayor and Congress corporator Chirag Zaveri said that the corporation needed to be prepared for the ensuing monsoon, water woes and unexpected expenses. He added that if this continued even giving salaries would be a difficult task.

Zaveri has asked the chief minister to provide a grant of Rs 500crore to the civic body. 

He added that there were pressing works related to drainage that would need allocation of funds. He gave the example of cave-ins that took place in the city recently and said that drainage works related to them will have to be taken up.
