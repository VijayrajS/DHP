‘High-risk patients won’t be shifted out of Covid hosp’
2020-06-09
Panaji: Asymptomatic Covid patients who fall in the high-risk category will not be transferred from the Covid hospital in Margao to the Covid care centre at Shiroda.

Children, pregnant women and senior citizens with comorbidities will not be shifted out of the Covid hospital in Margao, deputy director health services, Dr Ira Almeida said. 

The 220-bedded Covid hospital has a dedicated paediatric ward with a specialised team of paediatricians and obstetricians as well as its own ICU.

Once detected positive, the asymptomatic patients are taken directly to the 60 bedded-Covid care centre at Shiroda, while the symptomatic are taken to the Covid hospital.

“In case of any doubt, the asymptomatic patients will be taken to the Covid hospital and assessed by a physician before a decision is taken,” Almeida said.

While the first family brought in from Mangor Hill were symptomatic, the others who tested positive from the area after them were largely asymptomatic. “It is because the family was symptomatic that they came to the hospital and were detected. Had they been asymptomatic, they wouldn’t have been detected,” an official said. 

Health secretary Nila Mohanan on Sunday had said that asymptomatic Covid persons were being shifted to the Shiroda primary health centre (PHC) which has been now designated as a Covid care centre, while the symptomatic ones who required medical attention would continue to be accommodated at the covid hospital in Margao.
