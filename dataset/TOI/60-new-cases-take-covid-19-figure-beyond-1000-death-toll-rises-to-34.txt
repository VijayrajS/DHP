AURANGABAD: As many as 60 people tested positive for Covid-19 across Aurangabad between Sunday and Monday, taking the total number of cases to 1,022.


Moreover, three deaths were also reported at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). With this the death toll has gone up to 34.

The city saw its first Covid-19 case on March 15 when a 58-year-old woman professor with travel history to Russia and Kazakhstan was tested for coronavirus. Following her treatment at a private hospital, the woman recovered and was discharged on March 23. Thereafter, no new cases were detected in Aurangabad for over a week. 

On April 2, two cases were confirmed — one from Aref Colony and one from Cidco N-4. After their contact mapping more cases came to the fore and the total number of patients in Aurangabad had crossed the 500-mark on May 9. And the figure has now doubled in just 10 days. The new cases include 27 women and 33 men.

The deceased include a 65-year-old man, resident of Madani Chowk, who died at 6pm on Sunday, a 56-year-old woman from Paithan Gate and a 42-year-old man from Buddi Lane — they both died on Monday. 

“All three died due to Covid-19 infection,” Arvind Gaikwad, media interaction officer at GMCH, said. 

A total of 392 patients have so far recovered and discharged from different health facilities in the district.
