Fake coronavirus post on social media attracts police action
2020-03-15
Nashik: Two residents of the Sangamner taluka in Ahmednagar district — including a woman admin of a social media group — were reprimanded by the police for promoting fake messages on the coronavirus.

The Sangamner police said the action followed a complaint that was registered against the woman admin and a member of the group for posting and circulating a message about a coronavirus patient being found at the Sangamner bus stand.

The complaint was registered by the officials of the First Referral Unit (erstwhile Primary Health Centre) and the rural hospital after they noticed the message. The police got hold of both the accused.

Sub-divisional officer Shashikant Mangrule said both individuals were called at the police station where they were questioned.

One of the group members had put up a message claiming that a Covid-19 patient was found at the Sangamner ST stand. Sangamner is a big market town in Ahmednagar and is 75 km from Nashik city. It falls on the Nashik-Pune national highway.

During the police interrogation, the duo failed to provide any evidence of coronavirus spread. They were let off with a warning as it was the first time a case had been registered against them. In case of future complaints, stringent action would be taken against the concerned individuals, the police said.

The two were also asked to post in the group that the information posted earlier by them was the unconfirmed and fake and that nobody should believe the same.
