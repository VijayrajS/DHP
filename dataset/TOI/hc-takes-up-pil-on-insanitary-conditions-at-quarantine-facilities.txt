HC takes up PIL on insanitary conditions at quarantine facilities
2020-03-22
Hyderabad: The Telangana high court has taken up the insanitary conditions at the quarantine facilities created by the state as a public interest plea. HC is likely to take up the matter on Monday.

Following media reports that the conditions prevailing at these quarantine facilities are not in tune with the hygiene expected at such centres, Justice P Naveen Rao wrote to the judicial registrar on the need to take up the cause. The same was brought to the notice of the Chief Justice and senior judges all of whom agreed to take up the matter as a PIL asking the authorities concerned as to why two to three international passengers are being housed in one room.

Passengers arriving at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) from foreign countries are sent to the designated quarantine facilities. However, the rooms lack even the basic amenities. There is not enough water supply in the washrooms and so all efforts to maintain cleanliness goes in vain.

“While the state’s objective of assessing the health of all international air passengers, the place they chose for isolation wards is not fit for the purpose,” said the PIL, which made the state’s top medical and revenue authorities as respondents. The facilities should be improved immediately, it added.
