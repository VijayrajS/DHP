2020-03-25
Tirupati/Vijayawada: Police across Rayalaseema districts on Tuesday booked cases against persons venturing outside and seized vehicles to enforce the lockdown announced by the state government. 

A total of 99 cases were booked in Chittoor district under different sections of the IPC. Chittoor district collector Narayana Bharat Gupta and superintendent of police (SP) S Senthil Kumar carried out inspections at district headquarters on Tuesday and appealed to people to not take the government’s order on a complete lockdown lightly. “We have seen how the novel coronavirus wreaked havoc in several nations, where the death toll is in the thousands. Social distancing is the only option left with us. People should strengthen the efforts of the state and Union governments, by remaining indoors till March 31,” they said.

In Tirupati, police resorted to mild lathicharge against people loitering on the streets. Tirupati SP Avula Ramaesh Reddy warned violators of action. 

In chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy’s home district Kadapa, 20 vehicles were seized and cases booked against 20 persons for violating Section 144 of CrPC. 

In Kurnool district, police warned those who had come out onto the streets and said repeated offence would attract a jail term.

Meanwhile, in Vijayawada, a traffic constable, Sridhar, was hit by an SUV near Ramavarappadu Junction on Tuesday. The cop was hospitalised and the driver nabbed. 

Police were deployed to prevent people coming out of their homes and ensure that social distancing is followed. Cops, however, said not everyone was cooperating with the order.

Police sources said over 3,000 cops have been deployed in Vijayawada to ensure implementation of the lockdown.
