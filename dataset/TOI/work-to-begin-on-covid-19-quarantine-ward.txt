2020-03-08
Madurai: The government hospital for thoracic medicine at Thoppur is setting up a quarantine ward to isolate and take patients with possible symptoms of COVID-19, with the number of cases witnessing a rise in India and the first positive case in Tamil Nadu reported on Saturday.

On Saturday, dean of the Madurai Medical College and Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), Dr J Sangumani visited the hospital premises. “We’ve identified the building for the ward. We are modifying an existing building first. The building, which has 20 rooms will be modified as per specifications and toilets will also be built. All facilities will be made as per the model in China. Work on the ward is likely to start by Sunday or Monday,” Sangumani told TOI.

The dean also said that such quarantine wards could be used periodically for isolating and tackling the spread of any viral infection. He added that so far no date has been finalised for completion of the ward, but instructions have been given to finish the work on a war-footing. Meanwhile, sources said that other than this ward, a permanent quarantine ward may also be soon built as a new building at the hospital.

The Thoppur hospital has been identified as an ideal spot for a quarantine ward since it is located away from the city and any infected person can easily be shifted from the airport to the facility. In Madurai airport, more than 15,000 passengers have been screened for COVID-19 since January 28 and 25 people are currently under home quarantine.TNN
