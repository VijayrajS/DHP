MADURAI: A total of 50 people who had travelled from China to India are under home quarantine for novel coronavirus (nCoV) for at least 28 days in the district.

“We have asked them to avoid going to public places having a lot of crowd such as shopping malls at all cost. We’re following up with visits and calls every day on the status of their health,” said Dr P Priya Raj, district deputy director of health services. She also emphasized that the 50 people, who are being monitored, are only ‘passengers’ and that no one is showing any symptoms of illness.

Health officials are also creating awareness among public, especially in schools, both about nCoV and practicing regular washing of hands and cough hygiene.

Assistant city health officer of Madurai Corporation Dr S Vinodh Raja said that hoardings have been erected at urban primary health centres to create awareness. “Visitors to hospitals are made to clean their hands using hand sanitizer while leaving the hospitals. An advisory has been sent to all hospitals, theatres and malls to erect standees insisting people to wash hands for at least 15 times a day,” he said.

Meanwhile, in Tuticorin, district collector Sandeep Nanduri told reporters that all measures are in place to prevent spread of nCoV. “We have a special unit for screening sailors, especially those from China, at our sea ports in case anyone has any symptoms of the illness. Four people from the district, who had travelled from China, are being closely monitored by the health officials. There is no need to panic as so far there has been no sign of anyone suffering from nCoV in the district,” he said. The collector also said that the Tuticorin Government Medical College Hospital has set up special nCoV isolation ward fully equipped to handle nCoV cases.
