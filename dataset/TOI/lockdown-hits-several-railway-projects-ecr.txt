Lockdown hits several railway projects: ECR
2020-04-01
PATNA: The 21-day Covid-19 lockdown has disrupted all the construction works being carried out at different places under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway (ECR) at a cost of Rs 4,614 crore.


ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar claimed that the lockdown had hit the ongoing railway projects in Bihar. “Works like construction of new lines, rail bridges and foot overbridges as well as doubling of tracks and gauge conversion have been affected. Even after the lockdown ends, it will take time for the railways to restart the suspended projects,” the CPRO told this newspaper.

During the current fiscal, a sum of Rs 1,113 crore has been allocated to the ECR for completion of the Koderma-Ranchi, Koderma-Tilaiya, Hajipur-Sugauli, Bihta-Aurangabad and Motihari-Sitamarhi new rail line projects. Another Rs 2,243 crore has been allocated for track doubling work on the Kiul-Gaya, Samastipur-Darbhanga, Hajipur-Bachhwara, Karaila Road-Shaktinagar, Danea-Ranchi Road, Garwa Road-Ramna and Ramna-Singrauli routes. 

“The Patliputra-Pahleza Ghat new line work, the yard remodelling work at Kiul and Lakhisarai and the gauge conversion work on the Sakri-Laukaha Bazar and Jayanagar-Bardibas routes are also likely to be delayed, leading to additional expenditure. The lockdown has created labour crisis,” the CPRO said.

He added, “The lockdown has affected production work at the Bela wheel factory in Saran district and the electric locomotive manufacturing unit at Madhepura. Except track maintenance work, nothing else is being done under the ECR’s jurisdiction due to the lockdown.”
