Rising life cover awareness amid Covid helps insurance sector stage recovery
2020-06-11
Hyderabad: Thanks to higher awareness about the importance of having a life cover in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the life insurance sector seems to be slowly shrugging off lockdown blues. 

In May 2020, the first-year premium or new business by life insurers declined by only 25% as compared to the year ago period, whereas, in April 2020, new business had dropped 32.6 % compared to the year ago business.

While in April this year, the total new business premium logged by 24 life insurance players, including LIC, stood at Rs 6,727.74 crore (Rs 9,981.88 crore in April 2019), in May, it stood at Rs 13,739 crore (18,414.02 crore in May 2019). The first-year premium of LIC during May 2020 was Rs 10,211.53 crore (Rs 13,496.68 crore in May 2019) and during April 2020 it was Rs 3,581.65 crore (Rs 5,268 crore in April 2019).

Insurers pointed out that the enhanced awareness about the need to have life protection policies in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to this recovery and will also drive growth in the coming days.

“The private life insurance industry has recovered from a 40% de-growth in April 2020, to 32% de-growth in May 2020, which has been result of increased demand for protection products in the past couple of months. Because of the consumers’ constant focus on non-negotiable life-goals, we expect this demand to continue in the near future as well,” Prashant Tripathy, MD & CEO, Max Life Insurance said. 

He pointed out that Max Life has been able to limit its de-growth to 20% for both April and May 2020. “In May, we have seen an increase of 6% in the number of policies sold on a Y-o-Y basis and are confident that our focus on protection business and non-par savings products will enable us to claim back the customer demand and help get back towards consistent growth,” he said.

Tarun Chugh, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life too said that the company is witnessing a rise in the sale of protection plans on account of the increasing awareness amongst customers on protecting their risks. “Going forward, the industry will see an increase in the number of policies, but the value may not be very high,” he cautioned.
