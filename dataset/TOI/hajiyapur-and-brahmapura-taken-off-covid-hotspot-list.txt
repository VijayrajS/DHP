2020-05-12
Bareilly: In a huge relief for locals, Bareilly district administration on Monday allowed relaxation to residents of Hajiyapur and Brahmapura - declared as Covid-19 hotspots earlier in the aftermath of positive cases reported from the areas. Guidelines of lockdown, however, will need to be followed by residents and social distancing must be maintained. Inspections were also conducted by Bareilly district magistrate (DM) Nitish Kumar in the hotspots to take stock of the ground situation. “After some residents of Brahmapura and Hajiyapur localities were found to be Covid-19 positive, the two areas were declared as hotspots and were sealed by the district administration. Movements were also completely restricted. However, recent reports of the patients were found negative, and therefore, the two areas are no longer a hotspot. Now, some relaxation will be granted for locals," the Bareilly DM said. However, the DM cautioned that though the areas are no longer hotspots, police administration and civic authorities have been directed to make people adhere to the lockdown guidelines like before and ensure that social distancing is being followed. "Relief measures will be provided in the areas and some shops may be allowed to open, but people should not gather at public places or violate lockdown norms,” the DM added. Earlier in the month, the local administration had declared Bareilly as "red zone" after two persons were tested Covid-19 positive from Brahmapura. The infected persons were later identified as relatives of a quack, resident of Hajiyapur, who had later succumbed to the infection. Frequent flag marches were then held by Bareilly police across the city and in containment zones to ensure that local residents adhere to the lockdown guidelines. Legal actions were also being taken by civil as well as traffic police against commuters for flouting rules.
