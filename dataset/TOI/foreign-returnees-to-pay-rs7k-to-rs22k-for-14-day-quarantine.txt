GAYA: An estimated 8,000 foreign returnees will have to remain under paid quarantine in hotels, guesthouses and monasteries in Bodh Gaya for a period of 14 days. A tariff chart has been worked out by the establishment owners and officials in this regard. 


Officials said five different types of accommodation would be offered to the returnees, each with a different price. The total cost ranges between Rs 7,000 and Rs 22,400 for 14-day quarantine. 

Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said hotel rooms have been divided into three categories – super deluxe, deluxe and non-AC, depending on the available facilities. Super deluxe rooms will cost Rs 1,600, deluxe rooms Rs 1,000 and non-AC rooms Rs 800 per day.

Air-conditioned guesthouse rooms will be available at Rs 800 per day and non-AC rooms in guesthouses at Rs 600 per day. The returnees will have the option to choose any of the five categories of accommodation.

The tariff rate is in addition to meal and snack charges. Different categories of ‘thali’ options would also be there for the returnees. They will also have the option to pay item wise for their meal or snack consumption.

Being non-profit organisation, the Bodh Gaya-based foreign monasteries do not formally charge room rent from their guests but receive donations, which monastery managers claim is voluntary. However, those provided accommodation in the monasteries will have to mandatorily offer donations not exceeding Rs 500 per day.

Asked about the number of rooms available in Bodh Gaya for occupancy, the DM said about 4,500 rooms have been earmarked for the foreign returnees. 

As per sources in the Magadh divisional commissioner’s office, only six flights have so far been scheduled to land at Gaya airport between May 6 and June 3. Each flight will carry less than 200 passengers.
