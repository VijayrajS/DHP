Howrah hospital official’s family in quarantine
2020-04-11
KOLKATA: The wife and the daughter of the Howrah General Hospital official, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday and was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, were also shifted to a quarantine centre at New Town the same day. The mother-daughter duo reportedly went through a mental trauma to come to terms with the situation. 

The official’s wife, a teacher at NRS Medical College and Hospital’s microbiology department, had “never thought of facing such professional hazards”, for which her family had to stay in two separate places. 

The official was allegedly subjected to ridicule after the death of a Covid-19 patient admitted to Howrah hospital. After he had tested positive for Covid-19, there was panic among senior officials of the hospital and Howrah administration, many of whom opted for home isolation. This led to the closure of the hospital. 

The official had held meetings with the administrative officials before he was detected with Covid-19. Several staffers and doctors of the hospital are also in quarantine now. 

A family friend said that the government had promised to offer the “best treatment” to the health official. 

However, his wife and daughter did not test positive and their samples will be screened again. After further screening of their samples confirms that they are Covid-19 negative, they can return from the quarantine centre to their staff quarters on the Howrah hospital premises. Sources said that both the mother-daughter duo is keeping well while the condition of the health official is stable at MR Bangur Hospital. The official’s family has been under much stress as he was blamed by a section of doctors and other hospital staffers for admitting a patient, who had tested positive for Covid-19 and later died. 

Health department has appointed BP Shaw, who was earlier additional director of health service, as Howrah CMOH replacing Nishith Baran Mondal.
