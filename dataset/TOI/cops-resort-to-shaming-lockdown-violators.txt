2020-04-22
HYDERABAD: Even as they faced a backlash from the public for caning lockdown violators and in some instances using excessive force, police are now resorting to shaming those who break the rules by coming out of their homes. Police in Nalgonda district have set up a selfie point at Chityal for lockdown violators.


People breaking lockdown rules are asked to take a selfie with an ‘I am an idiot’ board in the background. The hoarding at the selfie point reads ‘I am an idiot and enemy to the society’. 

AV Ranganath, Nalgonda SP, said, “It is done by the local sub-inspector of Chityal to shame the violators.” 

Meanwhile, at One Town area in Vijayawada, police made violators, both men and women, write ‘I made a mistake’ 500 times on paper. Earlier, there were instances in places like Shadnagar, where police made lockdown violators sweep the roads. In certain places of the Telugu states, violators were made to do sit-ups. However in Prakasam district, the police personnel, who used excessive force, were suspended.
