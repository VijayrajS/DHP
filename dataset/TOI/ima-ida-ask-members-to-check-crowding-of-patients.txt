“The outpatients department (OPD) timings of different departments of medical colleges and institutes should be separated. Instructions were also issued to display informative posters at OPDs and private clinics to make patients and their attendants aware of the precautionary measures necessary to check spread of the coronavirus,” said senior vice-president of IMA (Bihar) Dr Ajay Kumar on Tuesday. There are about 11,000 IMA members.

The IDA Bihar unit has appealed to its members to avoid non-urgent and non-essential dental care services till March 31, said its president Dr Mohit Kumar. He said the receptors which attach coronavirus are maximum in the oral cavity and as such dentists and oral surgeons are highly vulnerable to contract the infection. 

“There is nothing to panic, at least in Bihar. However, we are looking at the trends of spread of this virus and it is worsening. So, we will appeal for closure of all private dental clinics in the state,” he said.

The IDA (Bihar) has about 8,000 members of which only 550 were working in government hospitals. The remaining practise in private clinics. Mohit said all those running private clinics have been advised to take patient’s history, especially whether he or she recently visited any foreign country affected by the Covid-19 or had other symptomatic problems like cough, fever or breathlessness.
