PUNE: One more China-returned traveller presenting flu-like symptoms was isolated at the civic-run Naidu hospital on Saturday to rule out novel coronavirus infection. 

With this, the number of individuals currently under the isolation facility in Pune has gone up to six. Samples of the previous five isolated individuals have tested negative for the virus.

“The newly isolated traveller is a 30-year-old man. His throat swab sample will be sent to the National Institute of Virology,” Ramchandra Hankare, chief of the health department at the Pune Municipal Corporation, said.
