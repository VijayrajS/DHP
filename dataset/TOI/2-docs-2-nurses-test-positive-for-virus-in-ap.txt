VIJAYAWADA: Four medical personnel tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday even as the tally in AP went up to 348 with 34 new cases reported. This is the first time in the state that medical staff have contacted coronavirus during treatment of a Covid-19 positive person in Anantapur district.

According to health authorities, two doctors and two nurses came into contact with a Covid-19 person, who died recently. They had attended to the man and offered initial treatment in the chest ward. The patient had a known case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was subsequently shifted to the ICU, where he tested positive for Covid-19 and succumbed to its complications on April 4.

This comes amid the suspension of a government doctor in Narsipatnam of Visakhapatnam district on Tuesday for making allegations over shortage of personal protective equipment to the medical staff. In all, the state recorded 34 fresh positive cases on Wednesday, taking the tally to 348. Guntur registered the highest number of 14 cases, followed by Anantapur 7, Nellore and Krishna 6 each, Chittoor 3, Prakasam 3 and West Godavari 1. Anantapur district medical and health officer Anil Kumar said they have been listing out all the medical personnel, who came into contact with the Covid-19 patient and his contacts to send them to quarantine wards or place them under home isolation. “We will conduct medical tests on all these persons,” said Anil Kumar.

Three Covid-19 patients were discharged from GIMSR Hospital in Visakhapatnam after their three consecutive samples came negative. Four patients were successfully treated so far in the district.
