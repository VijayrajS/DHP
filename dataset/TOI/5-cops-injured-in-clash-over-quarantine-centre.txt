JAMURIA: The OC of Jamuria police station in West Burdwan, Subrata Ghosh, along with four other cops, was injured when a clash broke out between police and locals outside a quarantine centre at Churulia on Tuesday. 

“Five policemen, including the Jamuria OC, were attacked by residents of the area who demanded that the quarantine centre be removed to somewhere else. Raids are on to arrest those who attacked police,” a senior officer said. 

Residents have reportedly been against the quarantine centre from the beginning. “We fear it would expose us to the virus,” a local said. An argument broke out between residents and police that snowballed into a fight with cops being attacked with stones and bricks. Reinforcements reached the spot and the mob was dispersed. The injured cops were taken to Akalpur primary health centre. 

West Burdwan CMOH Debashish Haldar declined to comment.
