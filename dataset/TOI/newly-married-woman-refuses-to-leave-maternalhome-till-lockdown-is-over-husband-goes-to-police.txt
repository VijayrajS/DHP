BAREILLY: A man from Sambhal approached police on Friday after his wife refused to leave her maternal home in Amroha till lockdown is over. She had gone there only after a few weeks of marriage and got stranded when the lockdown was announced. Police, however, respected the woman’s views and asked the man to wait till things return to normal.

The Sambhal man married the Amroha woman a few months ago. She had gone to her maternal house about two months ago, but couldn’t return due to the Covid-19 lockdown.

When the man phoned his wife, she said that police wouldn’t allow them to cross the border of two districts and they would need the cops’ nod. It is learnt that the man tried to convince his wife assuring him that he would get a pass issued, but the woman still refused, saying they may be in danger of getting infected by Covid-19, if they travel. The man then urged his in-laws to convince their daughter but she remained unmoved.

Finally, the peeved man reached the local police station on Friday to narrate his story and put forth his last argument that his mother was unwell, but the cops refused to buy that too.

Superintendent of police Yamuna Prasad said this was not an isolated case. “People stranded in other districts are approaching us for permission to bring their family home. Since it is a complete lockdown no such permission can be given till we get orders from the government of any relaxation,” he added.

Meanwhile, nodal Covid-19 officer Dr Neeraj Sharma said that those stranded in other districts will have to undergo thermal screening before entering the district. Suspected Covid cases will be put under quarantine, Sharma added.
