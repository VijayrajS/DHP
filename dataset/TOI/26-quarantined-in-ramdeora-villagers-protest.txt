Jaisalmer: Residents of Ramdeora resorted to a massive protest when 26 people were brought here to be kept in quarantine from Pokhran area of the district.

On getting information, the SDO and deputy SP reached Ramdeora and spoke to villagers.

The batch of 26 people was to be quarantined at Maheshwari Vikas Samiti Dharamshala in Ramdeora. Over 300 people led by Ramdeora sarpanch Samandar Singh Tanwar demanded that the administration shift this quarantine centre, which is situated in a populated area.

The administration, however, did not listen to villagers. SDO Ajay Amarawat said as per the national disaster act, patients have to be kept wherever place is available and these people are not corona positive and their reports are negative, but they have to be kept in quarantine for some days.

The villagers stuck to their demand for three hours and after a long discussion the SDO persuaded the villagers. Tanwar said that another dharamshala which was situated far away from the population was identified as a quarantine centre, but the administration has kept these people at the dharamshala situated in middle of the village.

Meanwhile, residents of ward number 1 in Pokhran staged a protest when a health team arrived there to collect samples after a resident tested positive on Sunday.
