Coronavirus scare: Chinese youth hale and hearty, but hoteliers scared to host him
2020-02-07
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health department officials have confirmed that the 27-year-old Chinese youth presently admitted in the isolation ward of General Hospital here is not affected by novel coronavirus and is perfectly healthy. Yet, he continues to be in the hospital as hotel and homestay owners in the city are reluctant to offer him a room despite the intervention of tourism department authorities. 

“As of now, the young man is not quarantined. It can be said that health department has offered asylum to him as hoteliers refused to provide him accommodation,” said district medical officer Dr Jose G D’cruz. Even the government-run tourist home, Yatri Nivas, could not provide him accommodation as the staff there were terrified when they learned that he was from China. 

He said that barring some preliminary examinations, no detailed tests were done on the young man. “Such tests only need to be done if the subject shows symptoms of the infection. Since he did not show any such symptoms, no further tests were done,” the doctor said. The DMO added that the Chinese youth is freely roaming around in the hospital premises. 

“All he wishes is to spend a few days in the city and experience a nice time. But, he can do it only after this existing uncertainty over his accommodation ends,” Dr D’cruz said. 

Though tourists from several countries are still arriving in the city, none of them have faced an ordeal similar to what the Chinese man went through.
