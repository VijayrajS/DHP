AHMEDABAD: Three districts of Gujarat — Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara — have 89% of total Covid-19 positive cases in Gujarat, according to state health department officials.


Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare), on Monday said that Ahmedabad has recorded 65% of Gujarat’s total cases, followed by 16% by Surat and 8% by Vadodara.

“Other 27 districts have reported 11% of cases. Three districts namely Amreli, Junagadh and Devbhoomi Dwarka have not reported any positive case so far,” she said.

Analysis of the cases on Monday evening reveal that out of 27 districts with 11% cases, 15 have five or less active cases. The active cases are defined by reducing the deaths and discharged patients from the total number of positive cases recorded.

These districts include Porbandar, Morbi and Jamnagar (0 cases), Gir Somnath, Sabarkantha, Tapi and Surendranagar (1 case each), Kutch and Dangs (2 cases each), Dahod and Navsari (3 cases each), Valsad (4 cases), Patan, Mehsana and Kheda (5 cases each). Ravi on Monday evening said that out of 3,548 total positive cases, 162 patients have died and 394 have got discharged. Out of 2,992 patients in hospital or Covid-19 care centre, 31 are on ventilators.

After a row over the missing district-wise test details from the state Covid-19 dashboard, Ravi said that the data entry operation had resulted in the lack of update. “The website has been updated with latest figures,” she said.
