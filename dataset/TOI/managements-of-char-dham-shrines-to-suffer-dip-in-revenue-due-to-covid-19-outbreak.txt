Managements of Char Dham shrines to suffer dip in revenue due to Covid-19 outbreak

Dehradun: All the four Char Dham shrines are likely to suffer huge financial losses this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which is set to impact the pilgrim footfall severely, said officials associated with the shrines’ management .

In 2019, a total offering of Rs 22 crore was collected by the four shrines — Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri. The maximum donation amount — Rs 18 crore — was collected by Badrinath, followed by Kedarnath and Gangotri (Rs 2 crore each), and Yamunotri (Rs 22 lakh).

However, the revenue figures may dip significantly this year, say observers. Not just the temple management committees, the district where these shrines are located are also likely to suffer loss of revenue.

Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal told TOI, “This year, our earning will not be in comparison to that of the last year. With social distancing and other measures, footfall is expected to dip.”

Uttarkashi district magistrate Ashish Chauhan also added, “We are not expecting much turnout at Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines this year due to the pandemic.” Acharaya Shiv Prasad Mamgain, vice-president of Char Dham Vikas Parishad, said, “Although large number of pilgrims are not expected in initial months of this Char Dham Yatra season, we hope that the footfall will go up in September.”

Meanwhile, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI, “We are working on a three-point strategy — to equip all hotels with sanitiser tunnel and thermal imagers; to issue third-party certification of cleanliness; and to allow pilgrims to the Char Dham shrines according to their capacity.”

The minister added that he is hoping the situation will improve and religious gatherings will be permitted. “I am sure that people from across the country would come to Char Dham shrines to pay their obeisance,” said Maharaj.
