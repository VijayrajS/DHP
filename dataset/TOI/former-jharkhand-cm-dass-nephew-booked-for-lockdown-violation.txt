Former Jharkhand CM Das’s nephew booked for ‘lockdown violation’
2020-04-11
Jamshedpur: Police have filed an FIR against 15 persons, including a family member of former chief minister Raghubar Das, for violating the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. After filing an FIR around midnight on Thursday, Sitaramdera police arrested five of the accused while efforts are on to apprehend the remaining, including Kamlesh Sahu, the nephew of the former CM.

Sahu, a BJP’s youth wing functionary, and the others had assembled at a local temple in Bhalubasa on Thursday afternoon to distribute food packets among people without taking permission from the administration, police said. Bhalubasa falls under the Jamshedpur (East) assembly constituency, which Das represented for 25 years since 1995, until he was defeated by BJP rebel-turned independent candidate Saryu Rai in last year’s assembly polls.

The distribution of food packets led to a large gathering of slum-dwellers in the area, resulting in violation of social distancing norms. “We reached the spot and dispersed the crowd,” said Sitaramdera police station in-charge Anjani Prasad. He added that apart from booking the violators under Section 144 of the CrPC, police have booked Sahu and the 14 others under Sections 269 and 270 of the IPC. Those arrested include Nagesh Prasad, Ramesh Prasad, Subhash Pandey, Videshi Sahu and Chanda Kumari, police said. TOI tried contacting Sahu several times, but his phone remained switched off.

With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing in the state, the East Singhbhum district administration has given strict instructions to implement the nationwide lockdown. Action has been taken against more than 200 people from different parts of the district on charges of violation of the lockdown since it came into force on March 24 midnight.
