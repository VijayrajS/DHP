THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 45-year-old man who had come from Dubai but showed no symptoms has tested positive for Covid-19 in Pathanamthitta. This has created a cause for concern for the district administration and health authorities.

A totally asymptomatic person in home quarantine in Adoor tested Covid-19 positive on Wednesday. Following this, there has been a demand for testing samples of all people under observation in the district. 

“This person had never developed any symptoms, including fever or cough. But his samples were taken since there were widespread complaints that he was defying quarantine guidelines and was moving around. It was a surprise when he tested positive,” said district collector P B Nooh.

This has proved that a person can become Covid-19 positive even if he has no symptoms. At present, there are 7,361 people under home quarantine in the district, said the district collector.

In this case, the Adoor native who reached the state capital from Dubai via Bengaluru had visited many places in his hometown. The district administration has released the route map of this person to identify all who came in contact with him.

The demand for testing of samples of all people under home quarantine has gained momentum. “No two patients are alike. Different people carry different kinds of dynamics. Hence, we cannot always claim that everyone will carry the same kind of symptoms. In this case, there might have been some mild symptoms or he might have taken some drug for fever. All these might have suppressed the symptoms,” said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer, infectious disease.

The health authorities have taken random samples from people under home quarantine in the district and have sent for testing. A few of the results have tested negative. Hence, there is no need for concern at present, said district health authorities.
