Goaâ€™s roads abuzz with commuters on Day One of lockdown relaxation
2020-04-21
MARGAO: With the government relaxing lockdown restrictions to enable commencement of commercial activities, a sudden surge in the movement of people and vehicles was witnessed on the roads while market places were abuzz with activity in most parts of Goa on Monday morning. Except for grocery shops, medical stores and essential services, all other businesses remained shut, however. 

All government departments as well as civic bodies started functioning on Monday, though visitors to the offices were scarce. As regular public transport is yet to be resumed, office-goers had to commute in their own vehicles and that explained the sudden increase in vehicular traffic. Taking advantage of the relaxation, others also ventured outdoors in their two and four-wheelers, adding to the traffic.

Police pickets were set up at busy traffic junctions and those violating traffic regulations were fined. Two-wheelers with pillion riders and four-wheelers with more than two occupants or with both front seats occupied were stopped, questioned, and a few, penalised.

Long queues were witnessed outside banks and other financial institutions. Though banks had resumed operations just a week after the lockdown, Monday saw a sudden increase in footfalls, sources said. 

In the mining belt of South Goa, heavy movement of iron ore trucks was seen along the Codli-Sanvordem and Cavrem-Curchorem route. Claims by the state mining department that truck movement from mines to jetties has been restricted to 25 trucks per hour, flew in the face of the chaotic mining transportation. Sources said that with more mining firms in the area likely to resume transporting their ore soon and with gradual increase in movement of private vehicles along the mining belt in the next few days, the traffic situation could pose a threat to the safety of the road users.
