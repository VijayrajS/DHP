Musical exercises for Malegaon Covid patients
2020-06-10
Nashik: The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has started a new initiative to de-stress the asymptomatic Covid-19 patients housed at the Covid care centre set up on the premises of MSG college.

These asymptomatic patients are now taking part in an hour-long musical exercise every morning from 6.30 am under the guidance of well-known medical practitioner Ujjwal Kapadnis. 

“This is our effort to reduce the stress of the asymptomatic patients. We have also provided a TV at the facility so that they do not get bored during their stay there,” civic chief Dipak Kasar told TOI. 

At one point, Malegaon was reeling under the pandemic. However, the efforts of the district and civic administrations helped tackle the spread.

Kapadnis said a 40-minute session features light aerobics, stretching exercises and yoga. “While we all do these exercises, devotional songs are played on music amplifiers. After that, we meditate for around 20 minutes,” added the doctor. 

While Kapadnis stands in the middle of the ground to conduct the exercises, patients do the exercises on the balconies of the college building. All social distancing norms are observed. 

“The feedback from the patients have been extremely encouraging. They have told me that they feel mentally and physically fresh after performing these tasks,” added Kapadnis. 

According to the municipal commissioner, he too started performing the exercises after he was tested positive last month. He too was asymptomatic.
