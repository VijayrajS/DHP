Located along the Parvati hill and stretching towards Sinhagad Road, Janata Vasahat is considered among the city’s large slum pockets. After an initial spike in cases, detection of new patients has come down since last few days, but still has not reached zero, the civic authorities said. 

With the sealing of entry-exit points, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has identified two schools within the locality for the stay of suspects patients of Covid-19 whose swabs test reports are awaited. Besides, the residents have been told to stay at home and step out only in case of emergencies.

“Soon after the first few cases were detected, the entire area was sealed. Even internal lanes were blocked, while the entry-exit points from the two approach roads — Neelayam bridge and Sinhagad Road — were monitored. For the initial two weeks, the cases went up significantly. However, since the last week, there has been a drop in new cases. An average of four to five cases are being detected in the area now,” a civic official said, adding that the authorities had also sealed the approach roads from the hill side.
