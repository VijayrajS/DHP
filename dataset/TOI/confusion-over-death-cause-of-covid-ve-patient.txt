VISAKHAPATNAM: The death of a 62-year-old man with kidney-related ailments at King George Hospital (KGH) has created alarm among medical staff who underwent Covid-19 tests after authorities suspected the death might be the city’s first Covid-related fatality.


The patient from Old Town was admitted to KGH on Thursday night following kidney problems and kept in the isolation ward. Doctors started treatment after his sample was sent for a Covid-19 test. 

The 62-year-old passed away in the early hours of Friday. His family shifted the body back home as they considered it to be a kidney-related death. A large number of medical staff and officials of the GVMC medical wing, however, rushed to the deceased’s residence a few hours later after his sample returned positive.

By this time, the final rites had been completed by his family. Sources said around 70 relatives took part in the ceremony. 

“Authorities are on their toes. They sent the sample for test and the result came out positive, by which time the person had died and had already been cremated,” said a medical staff at KGH.

KGH superintendent G Arjuna said medical staff at the hospital have been sent for testing. “However, it is uncertain whether the death was caused by kidney-related ailments or Covid-19. An eight-member high level committee headed by the director of medical education will examine the case and announce the cause of death, until which time the death should not be considered a Covid-related fatality,” he said.

District medical and health officer S Thirupathi Rao, AMC principal Dr PV Sudhakar and the KGH superintendent issued a joint statement urging people to not view it as Covid death until announcement by the high level committee.
