Madurai: Hundreds of people came out to buy vegetables and other essentials on Thursday, the first day after the end of the four-day intensive lockdown. The number of vehicles, which hit the roads were also higher than on other lockdown days.

Although the state government announced that shops will remain open till 5pm to avoid overcrowding, most of the residents completed their purchase well before lunch. 

A city police officer said that adequate strength was deployed at all markets and junctions to ensure that people maintain social distancing. Although there was large queues in front of the markets, they were made to ensure social distancing, he said.

However, residents claimed that social distancing norms went to the wind when they started purchasing. “There was no social distancing inside the market and people competed with each other while purchasing vegetables. Only solace is all of them were wearing masks,” said R Selvarani, a regular customer to the Bibikulam market.

District administration has enforced stricter measures in containment areas to ensure people do not move between streets. Only those into essential services were allowed to leave the zones. “Every individual involved in essential services has to provide his/her personal details before letting them outside. Most of them extended their cooperation, while a few protested,” said a corporation official posted at Race Course Colony.

A police official posted at a containment area in South Gate said that there is growing tension among people. They wanted to leave the area just to wander outside on the pretext of purchasing essentials, although vegetables are sold through the corporation inside.
