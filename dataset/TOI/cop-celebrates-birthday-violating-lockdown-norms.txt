Karnataka: Cop celebrates birthday violating lockdown norms
2020-04-29
HAVERI: A video of Ranebennur rural circle inspector Suresh Sagari celebrating his birthday attended by hundreds of people at Medleri village has gone viral. 


Surprisingly, a rowdy-sheeter too is seen taking part in the party that was organised on April 24. 

The celebration in violation of lockdown orders has drawn flak from villagers. Some villagers submitted a memorandum to IGP East Davanegere S Ravi on Monday and demanded stern action against the police inspector.

In the memorandum, villagers condemned the incident. They stated that the police officer, who was supposed to ensure people adhered to lockdown, himself violated the norms by inviting many people to his birthday. They alleged that people attending the birthday did not follow social distancing norms. 

They also took strong objection to the cop hobnobbing with the rowdy-sheeter as seen in the video.

When contacted, IGP Ravi said he has received a complaint from the villagers. “I will order a probe into the incident and initiate action against the police circle inspector if necessary,” he said.
