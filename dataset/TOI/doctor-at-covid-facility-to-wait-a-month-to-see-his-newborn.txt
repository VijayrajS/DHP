Ahmedabad: Doctor at Covid facility to wait a month to see his newborn
2020-05-22
AHMEDABAD: Dr Ravi Patel, a senior resident doctor in the department of community medicine at the Asarwa Civil Hospital hasn’t stopped beaming with joy since May 12, when he got the news that he had become father to a baby girl. Patel has refused to immediately his wife and child, who are at his father-in-law’s place in Kalol, despite getting permission from his boss. 


Patel, 29, is working at the special 1,200-bed Covid-19 facility at the Asarwa campus. So, while he has a job at hand that needs his presence every day given the rush of Covid-19 patients, the young doctor wants to avoid going home for now as a precaution. 

Patel is working in the control room of the Covid-19 treatment facility where he is required to co-ordinate with other doctors dealing directly with coronavirus patients. Doctors working in the Covid-19 facility need to be quarantined. Patel says that if he were to go home to see his daughter, he would have to get home quarantined for the next few days. 

“I am eager to go home to my wife and little baby. At the hospital we can take a lot of precautions like wearing a PPE kit but at home I could still be a risk to my family members,” said Patel has been married to his wife Mital for three years.

He is also involved in the analysis of Covid-19 patients by regularly monitoring their health records. Patel also is part of the contact tracing team. While he stays in touch with his family members through video calls, Patel says he has no plans of going home for another month or so. “When things get a little normal, I’ll go home. Maybe it will be after a month,” he says.
