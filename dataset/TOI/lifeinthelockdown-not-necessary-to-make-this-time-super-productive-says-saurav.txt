#LifeInTheLockdown: Not necessary to make this time super productive, says Saurav
2020-04-19
For the first few days, it was difficult to find ways to kill time. Now, I’ve found a rhythm in terms of life in general at home. After breakfast, I do one physical session, from 11.30am to 1.15pm, on the lawn in my building; I do some sprint and body-weight strength work. Then, I have lunch and sleep for a while. Now, I am also doing a nutrition course which the Professional Squash Association has recommended. I am doing it mainly to understand what’s good for me to eat as an athlete and how I can improve my diet. I cook on some days. The other day I made dinner — carrot-and-ginger soup, spinach and garam masala tomato sauce with sausages and penne pasta. And before I hit the bed, I speak to my wife for some time. She’s in Chennai and I am in Calcutta!

In terms of screen time, I spend time watching old matches. This helps me analyse what others are good at and see if I can use those moves in my game. My dad also lives in the same apartment complex, so he comes to my place for lunch and dinner. After dinner, we watch one episode of whatever series we are watching. And I am reading Sir Alex Ferguson’s My Autobiography as I am a big fan of Manchester United. 

It’s difficult not being able to be out there on the court. But I’ve realised that this status quo is not in my control. This is a kind of forced break, but it gives the time to take a step back and detach from constant stress on the body and mind. I’ve been in Calcutta for a month now. And I can’t remember the last time I spent this much time at a stretch in one place. We generally don’t have time to pause and think, so it’s not necessary that you have to make this time super productive. Life is almost like a match. You have different situations in it and the way you come out of it depends on how you perceive it mentally.
