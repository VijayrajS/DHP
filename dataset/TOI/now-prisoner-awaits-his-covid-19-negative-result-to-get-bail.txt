Now, prisoner awaits his Covid-19 negative result to get bail
2020-05-29
AHMEDABAD: While all prisoners, who are out on bail, are compulsorily tested to ascertain that they are Covid-19 negative before they are taken back in custody, a murder accused Manubhai Desai is facing a situation quite contrary to this.

Desai is the first inmate whose release from Sabarmati central jail depends on his Covid-19 test. If he is found Covid negative, he stands chances of getting bail. This is because he intends to go home and at stake is the health of his three children. He has sought bail because he could take care of his kids after his wife has been home quarantined after her Covid testing.

Looking at the risk of three kids, the Gujarat high court has ordered the jail authorities to get Desai’s Covid test done and it would decide on his request for temporary bail on Friday after receiving the result. 

Before this, the high court had ordered the government to get Covid test done on Desai’s wife, who lives in a containment zone in the eastern part of Ahmedabad.

Two weeks ago, Desai sought temporary bail saying that his wife was suffering from cold, cough and fever and is suspecting of having caught Covid infection. Later she was found Covid negative, but the HC ordered further tests on her to eliminate any possibility of infection. The HC asked Desai to wait because Desai’s home is in containment zone and the court feared that allowing a prisoner to go to containment zone would put other inmates at risk upon his return to prison. 

When the court took up hearing after the woman’s Covid test result, it was informed by Vivekanand Nagar police that she came in contact with Covid-19 positive person and therefore has been advised to remain home quarantined. 

Desai’s lawyer argued that since the wife is quarantined, the husband’s presence is more required for children. This has led the high court to order Covid test for Desai too. 

Meanwhile, upon the HC directions, all prisoners, who are out on temporary bail and parole, are put to Covid-19 test upon their return. If they are found negative, they are taken back in prison.
