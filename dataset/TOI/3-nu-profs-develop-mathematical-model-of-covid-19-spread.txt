3 NU profs develop mathematical model of Covid-19 spread

Nagpur: Three Nagpur University professors have developed a novel mathematical model on Covid-19 virus, which they claim would be useful in minimizing infection rate and improve recovery using suitability condition.Named as SIRM (S-susceptible, I-infective, R-recovered and M-mortality) model, the trio said it would be handy and useful if researchers and experts from medical sciences along with technologists work together on it.The model has been developed by senior professor at NU Mathematics department Kishor Deshmukh along with assistant professor at Laxminarayan Institute of Technology SD Warbhe and head of the department at Shri Lemdeo Patil Mahavidyalaya NK Lamba.According to them, the entire world is battling to contain the deadly virus which is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infectious disease believed to have originated in China.“Due to unavailability of proper vaccine, it’s spreading fast all over the globe. The situation is becoming uncontrollable and lakhs of patients have died due to it, particularly in the developed countries. To contain the spread of infection, a predictive mathematical model is must to inform about the prevention factor and suitability conditions, which include Covid distancing, lockdown, immunity, favourable environmental conditions,” Deshmukh told TOI.According to him, the SIRM model was physical in nature and numerically calculations were illustrated, but presented graphically. Also, special cases have been discussed by considering the impact of prevention factor.“The importance of the study is that prevention factor decreases infection rate, increases recovery rate and a very low mortality is observed. In this model, the current scenario of entire world is discussed and working of prevention factor in different situations is analysed. It was concluded that accuracy may vary depending on population, and conditions mentioned in the model,” Deshmukh, also the former NU science dean, said.IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS* When infection is less than carrying capacity of population, its rate from person to person decreases, and recovery & mortality varies with time* When infection is more than carrying capacity of population, its rate increases from person to person with time, but recovery & mortality reduces* When infection is equal to carrying capacity of population, its transmission rate is negligible
