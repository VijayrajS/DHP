Coronavirus scare: Kolkata churches bring changes to Lent prayers and services
2020-03-19
KOLKATA: Though there is no immediate instruction from either the Archdiocese of the Kolkata (Roman Catholic Church) or the Diocese of Kolkata (Church of North India), over closing down church services in the wake of the coronavirus scare, a series of changes are being brought about in the Lenten prayers and services, considered to be the most important phase in the Christian annual calendar. 

Christians are observing 40 days of Lent now, in the run up to Good Friday and Easter, when they spend time praying, fasting, donating and observing rigorous penance. 

However, vicar general of the Archdiocese, Dominic Gomes, said the situation in the city will be observed closely till Saturday in the wake of the first positive case in the city. It is only after the situation is reviewed on Saturday that a decision will be taken about the Sunday morning and evening mass, which is extremely important during Lent.

However, even during the routine services, several precautionary measures will have to be taken while receiving the Holy Communion. Written instructions have gone out from Bishop Paritosh Canning (CNI) and Archbishop Thomas Dâ€™Souza on this. No drinking of the wine from the chalice will be done for fear of instruction. According to tradition, everyone drinks from the same chalice. Holy water will also not be kept in designated containers to contain spread of the virus.

Church goers have been instructed not to embrace or touch any statue or the altar when they come to church. They should desist from touching or kissing the hands of the priest or the bishop, as is the custom. Again priests or bishops will not touch the forehead of anyone attending prayers as a sign of blessing. 

Touching anyone who is suffering from a disease or during baptising, which is a Christian way to bless, has also been debarred by both the churches. Washing of feet, which is a holy custom before Maundy Thursday, should be avoided, according to the instructions, to minimise the risk of contact.
