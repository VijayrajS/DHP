JABALPUR: A Covid-19 NSA detainee, who has been booked for attacking police in Indore during lockdown, broke out of an isolation ward in Jabalpur on Sunday afternoon, triggering a frantic search for him.


Jabalpur SP Amit Singh announced a cash reward of Rs 10,000 for his capture, which was later hiked to Rs 50,000. Four policemen who were guarding the detainee have been suspended. The runaway’s father is also coronavirus patient and is currently locked up in Indore central jail.

Jabalpur police have set up checkpoints on all roads leading out of the city. Collector Bharat Yadav has instructed police to intensify the search and appealed to residents to alert police immediately if any of them sees the suspect.

“People should not be scared. We are looking for him and are hopeful that he will be caught soon. This patient didn’t have severe symptoms,” said the collector.

The fugitive, a 28-yearold, was among four suspects arrested on April 7 for allegedly attacking a police team in Indore’s Chandan Nagar area. The next day, four of them were booked under NSA. Two were sent to Jabalpur jail and the other two to Satna.

The jail superintendent in Jabalpur realized that one of the NSA detainees had Covid-19 symptoms so he sent both of them to a hospital isolation ward and had them tested. One tested positive on April 11. The two sent to Satna tested positive the next day. He was in the isolation ward of Netaji Subhash Bose Medical College and Hospital in Jabalpur along with the other Covid-19 patients.

On Sunday, they were being shifted to the superspeciality ward, when the NSA detainee seized his chance and escaped.

The entire police escort party that took him and the other two to Satna, jail officials who came in contact with them, and the guards deployed to guard him initially – some 27 in all – are in quarantine.
