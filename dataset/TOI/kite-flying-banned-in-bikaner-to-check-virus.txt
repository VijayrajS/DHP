Rajasthan: Kite flying banned in Bikaner to check coronavirus
2020-04-15
JAIPUR: With a lot of people huddling together to fly kites from their terraces, the Bikaner district collector on Tuesday banned the manufacture and sale of kites and manjha. 


At Bikaner, there’s a tradition to fly kites in the run up to Akshay Tritiya festival on April 26. 

The district administration in consultation with doctors said the virus could easily spread during kite flying. 

“There are cases when people are asymptomatic and are flying kites. So, when a kite snaps and lands in somebody’s house, the latter might get affected,” said an officer at the district collectorate in Bikaner. In Jaipur’s curfew-bound Walled City, people in large numbers fly kites. Jaipur police commissionerate, however, is yet to come up with any such instruction. “For rural areas which are under Jaipur district other than the part which is under Jaipur police commissionerate, we have asked the SDM concerned to keep a check on kite flying,” said an officer with Jaipur collectorate.

Bikaner collector Kumar Pal Gautam while issuing the order of banning kites asked authorities for its strict compliance.

Doctors at SMS Hospital said the virus can survive for four hours on kite paper while it can survive for eight to 10 hours on thread. “If an infected person is flying kites, it is likely that they can infect other people through kites,” said doctor CL Naval, a senior physician at SMS Hospital.
