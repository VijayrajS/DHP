Thanjavur: A 42-year-old man from Kumbakonam who had returned from the West Indies tested positive for Covid-19 and is being treated at the isolation ward of the Government Medical College Hospital in Thanjavur. Hospital authorities said the patient’s condition was stable. He was previously treated for cold and fever at a private hospital in Kumbakonam.

According to hospital sources, the person had arrived in Chennai on March 18 and went to his native near Kumbakonam by bus. As he developed mild fever with cold, he had visited a private hospital in Kumbakonam on March 20. 

Though the doctor who examined him asked him to go to government hospital, he turned up there only on March 21. He was referred to the Thanjavur medical college hospital for a medical test and immediately sent to the isolation ward at the hospital.

During the preliminary throat swab test, it came to light that there was a symptom of coronavirus. Meanwhile, the final test result which came on Saturday confirmed it and he was put under observation, medical college dean Kumutha Lingaraj told TOI.

“His family members, wife, two sons have been put under home quarantine. The patient’s sister from Chidambaram in Cuddalore district had come over to Kumbakonam to meet her brother. So, their family members have also been put under quarantine,” dean said. 

The cough has subsided and he is stable, she added.
