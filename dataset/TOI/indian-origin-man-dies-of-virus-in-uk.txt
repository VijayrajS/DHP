LONDON: A British Indian Krishna devotee who regularly visited Bhaktivedanta Manor in Watford has become the sixth person in Britain to die from coronavirus. Manohar Krishna Prabhu, in his eighties, passed away at Watford General Hospital on Monday night. 


Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: "I am sorry to confirm a sixth patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. The patient, being treated by West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, had underlying health conditions. It appears the virus was acquired in the UK and full contact tracing has begun."


Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage

Manohar is the first Indian-origin person known to have died of the virus in Britain. His son is still being treated at the hospital. A Krishna devotee, Parasuram Das, said that Manohar, a Sindhi, had contracted the virus from an Italian man who has come to his house to buy some audio equipment from his son. The Italian man was unwell, he said. "Manohar fell ill soon afterwards and went into hospital about 10 days ago. Four of our temple guys who went to visit them last week have been put in quarantine." The devotees who went to visit the duo in hospital did so before the coronavirus was diagnosed as initially they thought he had pneumonia.

Manohar's family issued a statement through the trust saying: "We have lost a loving, caring father, grandfather and brother. His age and failing health did not stop him from living a full and complete life and always doing things for other people. He was guided by his innate kindness. Our father will be sorely missed, not just by us but by those whose lives he touched." The estate of Bhaktivedanta Manor was donated to Iskcon by George Harrison of the Beatles after he developed an interest in Indian spirituality after the band's tour of Rishikesh in the 1960s.
