2020-04-25
Pune: The crescent heralding the onset of the holy month of Ramzan was sighted here on Friday evening, but the usual buzz was missing due to the lockdown.

However, citizens looked determined to fight the coronavirus by praying at home and avoiding gathering for prayers or ‘iftaar’, the breaking of the fast. “Ramzan will come again next year, and we will be able to see it only we if we survive the coronavirus,” said Saif Ahmed, a Kondhwa resident currently working from home for an American insurance firm.

 Maulana Abdul Rahaman, secretary, Sunni Ulema Council, Pune, said, “We have requested the administration to allow use of loudspeakers for giving Azaan-call for prayer five times a day at mosques and read the ‘dua-prayer’ before fasting (‘sehri’) and ‘iftaar’ for the Muslims. The mosques will remain closed as per the lockdown directives. We have urged our brothers to offer Ramzan namaz at home.”

Haji Zakir Shaikh, president of All India Quami Tanzeem (Western Maharashtra), said, “All eateries selling Ramzan delicacies will remain closed. Some have tied up with food delivery platforms. The governmentcan increase milk supply during Ramzan.”

Community leader Akbar Pathan said, “The district administrationcan allow the market to be open from 3.30am-12 noon. The government can relax the lockdown rues for Eid-ul-Fitr namaz by maintaining social distance between 7am and 12 noon.”

Rafiuddin Shaikh, general secretary of the Seerat committee, Poona, said, “Our pplication, filed with the city police on April 20, for permission to give ‘Azaan’ and read dua with moderate volume on loudspeakers at mosque is pending.”

DCP (special branch) Mahesh Gatte said, “All religious places have been closed due to the lockdown. We have not received representation from the community members for giving ‘Azaan’.”
