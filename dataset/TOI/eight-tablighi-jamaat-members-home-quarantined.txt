HARIDWAR: As many as eight Tablighi Jamaat members from Manglaur have been put under home quarantine for the next 14 days to avoid any chances of spread of the deadly coronavirus.

Police officials will put a notice at their homes so that their neighbours and other visitors know that a suspected coronavirus patient has been quarantined in the house.

Swapn Kishore Singh, superintendent of police (rural), told TOI, “Eight people — one from Akbarpur village near Manglaur and seven from Malanpura locality of Manglaur — had gone to Delhi on February 17. After staying in Delhi for a couple of days, they visited Sultanpur district near Lucknow.”

Meanwhile, Piran Kaliyar police arrested a 25-year-old man from a Roorkee village on Tuesday for posting derogatory remarks against a community on his Facebook wall.
