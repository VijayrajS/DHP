Disregarding social distancing in Unlock 1.0 might land you in legal trouble
2020-06-11
On Monday evening, during a surprise check at a restaurant, the Delhi Police found that 35 persons were partying without following social distancing norms. Even as state governments are relaxing restrictions and allowing restaurants, malls and markets to open, it doesn't mean you can forget about social distancing norms. Not wearing a mask, gathering for a party or exceeding occupancy limit in vehicles can result in a fine and might even land you in jail.


Planning to step out without mask?
If you are stepping out without a mask, be ready to pay the penalty. The penalty can be from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000, depending on where in NCR you are.


No spitting in public
Given the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, spitting in public is also an offence now, for which you might have to pay Rs 100-1,000, depending on the area you are in. The Delhi Metro has planned to impose a penalty of Rs 1,000 on spitting in its premises once it resumes operations.

 


Not the time to party
As per the guidelines issued by the MHA for Unlock 1.0, restaurants have to keep occupancy to 50% for dine-in and encourage takeaways. No private gathering apart from marriages or funerals are allowed. Even in these cases prior permissions have to be sought. Police officials point out that the night curfew also ensures that thereâ€™s no partying.


Social distancing in cars too
As per the MHA order, those travelling in four-wheelers are allowed to have "maximum two passengers besides the vehicle driver". Anyone who is violating this can be penalised.
