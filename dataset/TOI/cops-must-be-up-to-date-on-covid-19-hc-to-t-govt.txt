Cops must be up-to-date on Covid-19: HC to Telangana government
2020-05-13
HYDERABAD: The high court on Tuesday directed the state government to keep its policemen informed about the Covid-19 situation and the relaxations being announced by the Centre and the state to various sectors. 


The bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman turned critical towards some incidents where the police acted in a rude manner with people during the current lockdown period.

“It seems they are not kept informed about the gradual easing of norms. Scores of offices and sectors are permitted to open and function and police should know this,” the bench said. The bench cited the example of its own staff being prevented from attending to their duties. 

The bench was dealing with a plea filed by advocate Umesh Chandra, who wanted the court to restrain the police and punish the errant cops at Wanaparthy, where a father was beaten up by cops in front of his minor son. 

AG BS Prasad assured the court that he would brief the DGP about what the court said. The case was posted to May 26.
