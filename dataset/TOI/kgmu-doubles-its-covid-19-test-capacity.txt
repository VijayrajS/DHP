KGMU doubles its Covid-19 test capacity

LUCKNOW: King George's Medical University (KGMU) doubled its capacity for Covid-19 confirmatory tests from Saturday and decided to start rapid antibody test on suspected cases approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently.


“KGMU’s microbiology department had two machines that could conduct 180 confirmatory tests in 24 hours. Now, as we have received two more units—one each from National Health Mission programme and ICMR-—we would start conducting 360 tests daily,” said KGMU vice-chancellor Prof MLB Bhatt.

“To ensure smooth functioning of the lab we have also doubled the staff strength,” he added.

Bhatt further said that “in the rapid antibody test a sample is divided into three parts and tested one after another to minimise the error percentage.”

He added that “KGMU currently has reagents to test only 1,500 samples. However more kits would arrive in 24 hours.”

Rapid antibody or strip test is done to check presence of antibodies of coronavirus in the blood sample of a person. With the help of the strip test it can be assessed whether a person is infected or not. After this test, the patient's swab samples can be sent to lab for confirmatory test if there is a requirement for it.

The strip test can be done quickly and help in identifying suspected cases easily, Bhatt added.

A team of 15, including doctors, research scholars and lab assistants of the microbiology department of the medical university, has been working round the clock from February when the Covid-19 cases started surfacing in the state.
