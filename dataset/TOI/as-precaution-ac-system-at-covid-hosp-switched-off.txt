2020-05-23
Panaji: Although the ESI hospital converted into a Covid-19 hospital has central air conditioning, this has been turned off to ensure that the hospital and entire system is not contaminated with coronavirus. 

The wards are using fans and special standing high efficiency particulate air (Hepa) filters ready for use in the operation theatre and in the ICU. These are air purifiers filter the virus and help decrease viral load in that space.

The hospital currently has 38 Covid+ patients, including a pregnant lady, a senior citizen aged 61, a four-year-old infant whose mother tested negative and three children aged 3, 6 and 11 along with their mother who have all tested positive. 

The one-year old baby girl who tested positive along with her family members last week was discharged on Friday and sent to institutional quarantine. 

The patient’s family members are strictly not permitted to visit their loved ones but are encouraged to communicate with them via phone. 

After the active positive patients went from nil to 40 plus in a week’s time, the hospital’s capacity was doubled this week. The 100-bedded hospital was expanded to 170 beds on Tuesday and to 200 beds on Thursday. 

Health secretary Nila Mohanan said there are plans to further enhance the hospital’s capacity to 220 beds. 

Till date none of the Covid+ patients who have been admitted to the hospital including the initial seven cases, ever required to be admitted to the ICU or ever required oxygen or to be put on a ventilator. 

All the positive patients admitted to the hospital over the past week arrived in Goa either by train, by road in a car, via a special bus and by sea. 

All the doctors, nurses and multi tasking staff and housekeeping working at the hospital have all been provided with accommodation in the vicinity of the hospital.
