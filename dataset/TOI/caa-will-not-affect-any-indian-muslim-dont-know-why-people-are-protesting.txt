NAINITAL: Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP, Subramanian Swamy said on Tuesday that the Citizenship Amendment Act will not affect any Indian Muslim.


Swamy who was in Nainital was responding to questions when he was asked about the clashes between the pro and anti-CAA protesters in Northeast Delhi. Swamy said that the CAA will not affect any Muslim in the country and that since there have been no discussions on the National Register of Citizens, the people are protesting against something that hasn’t even been proposed yet. “The protesters are protesting for something that hasn’t even happened yet. The CAA will not affect Muslims and the NRC hasn’t even come into effect, therefore, there is no need to protest,” Swamy said.

When asked what effect the protests will have on the visit of the US President Donald Trump, Swamy said, “Trump came to India with good intent. Therefore the protests will not have any impact on his visit,” he said.
