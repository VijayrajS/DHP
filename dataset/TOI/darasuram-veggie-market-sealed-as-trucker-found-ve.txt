THANJAVUR: After a truck driver who transported potatoes to Darasuram vegetable market in Kumbakonam from Mettupalayam tested Covid-19 positive, officials sealed the market on Monday. 


The 37-year-old truck driver, a native of Cuddalore, has been quarantined at the Government Medical College in Thanjavur (GMCH). 

Health workers have identified 50 people from the market with contact history and took their swab samples. 

All the 50 contacts â€“ mostly loadmen and vendors - have been asked to quarantine themselves at their home itself, officials said.

Darasuram vegetable market is the biggest market in the central region, next to Gandhi Market in Trichy, with 950 shops and handling around 300 tonnes of vegetables daily, sources said. 

The truck driver reached Mettupalayam from Uttar Pradesh with a load of Bellary onions. After unloading the onions, he reached Kumbakonam with potatoes. Before entering the town, police intercepted the truck at Neelathanallur check-post in Kumbakonam on May 8. After disinfecting the truck at the check post, health workers took swab from the driver and allowed him to proceed to the market. 

When the results came on May 10, health workers called the truck driver and took him to the isolation ward at GMCH. 

Based on the information, municipality commissioner Lakshmi and revenue officials sealed the market. The market was shifted to Darasuram-Valayapettai Bypass road on Monday.
