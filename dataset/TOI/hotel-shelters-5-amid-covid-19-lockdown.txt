Hyderabad: At a time when many landlords and hostel owners are apprehensive about retaining their tenants, for fear of contracting the coronavirus, a hotel in Shamshabad has opened its doors to guests stranded in the city following the nationwide lockdown.

With all domestic connections suspended and borders sealed, the Airport Palace Hotel — not too far away from the RGIA police station — has sheltered two families and an airline captain, providing them with essential services. Among them is an elderly couple from Visakhapatnam, who recently returned from Kerala after attending an Ayurvedic treatment camp.

“Initially, we were a little apprehensive about staying open as most hotels in Hyderabad have pulled their shutters down. But then we realised these people have nowhere to go and it would be inhuman on our part to evict them,” said Ram Chander, owner of the property. 

Apart from the rooms, he has also stationed one staff at the hotel who can run errands for the guests particularly in times of medical emergency. There is also a cook who plates up three meals a day. “While we are charging a fee, it is a nominal rate. We decided to forgo profits at such a time,” Chander said.

Apart from the sexagenarians, there’s another young couple from Rajahmundry, who were on their way home from Ahmedabad when the lockdown was announced. The airline crew is from Mumbai. “Though we aren’t being able to provide any luxuries, we are making sure they get all that’s absolutely required,” Chander said.

Kumar Raju, who helped the elderly couple find accommodation here, is all praises for the hotel. “I am really thankful to the hotel staff for taking such good care of my friend’s parents. I get restless and worried at times. But then I know they are in good hands. I just pray they can reach home safely, soon,” said Raju.
