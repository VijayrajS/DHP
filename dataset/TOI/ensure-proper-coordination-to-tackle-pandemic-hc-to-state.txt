Ensure proper coordination to tackle pandemic: Bombay HC to Goa
2020-04-09
PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed government officials to ensure proper consultation and coordination among themselves in tackling the pandemic in the state, including at the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB) at Bambolim.

The court passed the order in a public interest litigation filed by a senior doctor at IPHB highlighting the risks doctors at the institute face in the absence of proper protocol for treating patients in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The court has listed the matter for next hearing on April 15 after the advocate general sought time to reply.

Dr Ashutosh Prabhudessai stated that there are lack of facilities to identify carriers of Covid-19 and to contain the virus. Despite communicating with authorities concerned and the hospital administration about the dangers doctors face and steps necessary to be taken, there has been no proper positive response, as a result of which he was forced to file the PIL Prabhudessai further stated. 

The petitioner sought a direction to the government to provide video conferencing facility in the IPHB for doctors and other administrators to communicate among themselves by maintaining social distancing.

Besides, he sought the same facility involving other stakeholders, such as the Goa Medical College and ESI hospital, which is the designated Covid-19 treatment centre.
