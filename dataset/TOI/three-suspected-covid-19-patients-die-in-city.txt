LUDHIANA: Three suspected Covid-19 deaths were reported at the civil hospital on Monday.

A 59-year-old ASI, who was posted with the DIG, Phillaur Range, suffered cardiac arrest at his house in Dehlon at 2am. The family took him to the civil hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. “Acting cautiously, we have sent his throat swab for Covid-19 test,” a doctor said. He was a diabetic.

In another case, 27-year-old resident of Khanpur village, near Alamgir, was admitted to the civil hospital around 8pm on April 19. His father said, “First, we visited two private hospitals that referred my son to the civil hospital. On April 18, I took him there, but a doctor sent him home after giving medicines. The next day, he was gasping and complained of breathlessness at 7.15pm. We immediately took him to the civil hospital again, but he died early on Monday.” 

His brother said, “His tests and X-ray were conducted late. On April 18, the civil hospital doctors did not admit him, citing patient load. If private and government hospitals are not serious, where will the common man get treatment from?”

The on-duty doctors said, “His throat swab was taken after he died. He was also a diabetic. We are waiting for the report.” 

In the third case, an eight-year-old girl of Salem Tabri was on Monday admitted to the civil hospital, where a doctor said, “She was brought dead.” Her father said, “My daughter had been suffering from typhoid for the past one week. She had cough, cold and fever, too. We took her to DMCH. As it was expensive, we brought her to the civil hospital.”

Senior medical officer Dr Geeta Kataria said, “The girl’s throat swab was taken for testing. In the case of the 27-year-old man, we have specific criteria to admit patients to the isolation ward. I will look into the matter and check lapses, if any.”
