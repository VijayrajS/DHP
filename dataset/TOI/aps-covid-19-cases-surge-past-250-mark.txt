2020-04-06
VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh on Sunday recorded 60 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 252.


It took just five days for the state to surge past the 250 mark from 44 cases on March 31. Kurnool has the highest number of 53 cases, followed by Nellore at 34, Guntur at 30, Krishna at 28 and Prakasam at 23.

Of the 252 cases, nearly 225 are linked to the Delhi Jamaat meeting. According to health authorities, they tracked nearly 950 Delhi returnees and their 1,118 primary contacts.

Samples have been collected from nearly 880 people, who went to Delhi meeting and their immediate contacts.

The health department announced the details of 90 patients including towns and cities they belong to.

Apart from demarcating an area of 3-km radius around their residences as containment zones, officials informed that they declared a buffer zone in an additional 5-km radius.

In another dvelopment which could reflect the fear among the public over the pandemic, about 200 ‘108’ ambulances had ferried nearly 3500 persons to various hospitals in March in the state after receiving panic calls.

According to sources, the 108 vehicles would hardly get 1,500 emergency calls a month.

“But there was a sudden increase in the number of calls, primarily due to the panic situation over the coronavirus. The trend may even continue in April due to the increasing cases, ongoing lockdown and travel restrictions,” said an official.

A newly inaugurated virus research and diagnostic laboratory at the King George Hospital became operational from April 6.

The state government has already set up six 24x7 VRDLs in Tirupati, Vijayawada, Kakinada, Kadapa, Guntur and Anantapur with combined testing of 570 samples a day. 

The new lab is expected to further increase the testing capacity of the samples in the state.
