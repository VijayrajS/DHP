Hyderabad: With major bottlenecks and long-pending maintenance works being carried during the lockdown, passengers will notice improvements in the services across the South Central Railway (SCR) zone once the movement of passenger train begins. 

“A major block of 72 hours was taken in Kazipet yard for pending yard remodelling to replacing old wooden scissors railway tracks which was laid in 1970. The pending work will not only improve the safety but also the speed of train movement through the yard,” reads an official statement from SCR. 

Officials informed that the renewal of old wooden rail with newer ones in the Vijayawada junction will provide a vital link and flexibility in the operations of the yard. “This will improve the movement of train service towards Secunderabad and Visakhapatnam,” said Ch Rakesh, chief public relations officer, SCR. 

The tracks between Rajahmundry and Visakhapatnam, which were washed out in 2013 and 2014 during Cyclone Helen and Cyclone Hudhud respectively, were also provided with a new bridge. “21 hours traffic block was availed to finish the work, required for passage of flood water to avoid breaches,” the statement read.
