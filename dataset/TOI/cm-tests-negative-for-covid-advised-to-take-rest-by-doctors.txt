NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has tested negative for Covid-19. Two days after developing Covid-19 like symptoms, he underwent the test on Tuesday morning. 


“The result of the Covid-19 test is out, and the chief minister has tested negative,” said an official. Kejriwal reported mild fever and sore throat on Sunday afternoon and has since gone into self-isolation. 

Since fever and sore throat are among the symptoms of corona infections and Kejriwal has a long medical history of diabetes, one of the comorbidities, the doctors advised him to undergo the test. 

The CM is feeling better and his health condition is improving, said an official. “The doctors have advised the chief minister to take proper rest,” he added.

The test result relieved Aam Aadmi Party functionaries and well-wishers of Kejriwal. “Due to the power of prayers of the people, the Covid-19 test of CM has come negative. The CM is working day and night to serve the people of Delhi in this time of crisis. We pray to the God that he recovers fast,” said AAP MP Sushil Gupta.

In Kejriwal’s absence, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia participated in Tuesday’s meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to assess the Covid-19 situation in the national capital. 

Delhi has been reporting more than 1,000 cases almost daily for the past several days, with its corona tally crossing the 30,000 mark on Tuesday.
