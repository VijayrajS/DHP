Feeling the heat: Coronavirus likely to hit ship movements at Vizag Port
2020-02-20
As the economic damage caused by the outbreak of coronavirus mounts around the world, authorities at the container terminal of Visakhapatnam port expect a 20% drop in ship berthing from March as a result of the deadly disease. They claimed, since mid-January number of berthing confirmations at the terminal has reduced considerably.

“We are expecting a drop of 20% in ship berthing at the container terminal from March. Already the number of berthing confirmations has fallen. This might be a fallout of the coronavirus epidemic,” a senior official from the Visakha Container Terminal told TOI.

The coronavirus epidemic broke out in China last December and till Wednesday there has been 74,185 confirmed cases in the country. A little over 2,000 people affected by the disease have died in China. Several other countries have also reported cases of coronavirus, including India.

However, an official said that they, at the Visakhapatnam port, have not felt the impact of the virus until now. This is because the shipping lines make passage plan and take berthing confirmation at least 45 to 60 days in advance.

“Those ships scheduled to berth at the terminal in January and February had sought confirmation from us sometimes between November and December. There had been no such effects on the movement of those ships. But, now we are expecting the bad time to begin,” the official added.

The container terminal handles 30 to 35 ships a month. Most of these vessels come from China and other North and Southeast Asian countries. The highest numbers of rakes the terminal has handled are 46 in August 2018 and 44 in September 2019.
