Haven’t defied lockdown: Jitan Ram Manjhi
2020-04-24
PATNA: Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi courted a controversy by allegedly flouting the lockdown norms, a charge he later denied on Thursday.

Manjhi reached Patna from his native village Mahakar in Gaya district on Wednesday. The former CM was escorted by a police team as per the protocol and even hooters were used by the road clearing party during the 100km-long journey.

The HAM(S) chief, however, said the purpose of his visit to the state capital was to meet the Speaker of the state assembly. “I have not flouted any norm. I left for Patna after April 20 when some relaxations were announced in the lockdown,” he said.

To buttress his point, the former CM said, “Had I been not aware of the lockdown norms, I would have visited Patna before April 20. But I didn’t do anything wrong. Government offices have been opened due to relaxation in the lockdown.”
