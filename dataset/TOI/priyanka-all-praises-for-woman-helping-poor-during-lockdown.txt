Prayagraj: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote to a deaf and mute woman from city and lauded her for lending a helping hand to the homeless and poor, during the lockdown announced to contain the spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19). 

Naseema Begum has been distributing food packets among homeless persons in different parts of the city ever since the lockdown was enforced on March 24. On Sunday, senior Congress leaders handed over the letter to Naseema. 

Congress general secretary Irshad Ullah said, “Naseema Begun has been distributing food and groceries among the poor in Kydganj, Bahadurganj and adjoining areas since the past one week.”

The letter reads “Bol aur sun na sakne ke bawjood apne is aapda ke waqt jis tarah se asahayon aur zarooratmando ki sewa main apne ko samarpit kiya hai, usse humein aap par naaz hai. Apne sabit kiya hai ki sharirik apangta bhi insaniyat ki sewa ki jazbe main bandha nahi daal sakti. Insaniyat ki yahi sewa sacchi deshbhakti hai. Aapke iss sewa bhav se desh ki karodo logon ko prerna milegi. Aapke sewa bhav ko salam (I am proud of you for deciding to dedicate yourself to the service of the poor and needy in such testing times, despite not being able to speak and hear. You have proved that a person’s disabilities is no bar for humanity. Service for humanity is true patriotism. Your efforts will inspire millions in the country. I salute your drive.)”
