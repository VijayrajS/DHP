AIIMS public relations officer Harish Thapliyal told TOI that the patient, who is pursuing medicine in China, has been kept under observation in the isolation ward. “Her condition is improving. We are awaiting her medical reports from Pune,” said Thapliyal.

Meanwhile, the authorities of health department also conducted a review meeting on the deadly coronavirus, which has claimed over 200 lives across the globe and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday. The meeting was attended by both government and private hospital representatives who informed the health department about their preparedness regarding the tackling of coronavirus cases.

“The private hospitals were informed about the protocol they are supposed to follow in coronavirus cases. They had to inform the health department and government immediately and the patient should be kept in isolation,” said Dr Pankaj Kumar Pandey, in-charge health secretary. He added that anyone who is suffering from cough, cold, and respiratory issues and has visited China after January 15 should be treated as high priority cases.

Director General (DG) health, Dr Amita Upreti told the authorities of Indian Medical Association (IMA) that no private lab is authorised to detect coronavirus and hence people should be informed regarding the same. “The private institutions must not disclose the identity of the patient which too is a part of the protocol,” she added.
