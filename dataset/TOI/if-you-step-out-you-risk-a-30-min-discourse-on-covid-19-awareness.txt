COIMBATORE: The city saw major traffic hold-ups on Monday with police stopping vehicles at various points to create awareness on Covid-19. 

In some parts of the district, vehicles were given a yellow colour-tagged marking with a warning that any vehicle with three such markings will be confiscated. In many parts of the city, including Lawley Road Junction, Singanallur Road Junction and Kavundampalayam Junction on Mettupalayam Road, serpentine queues of vehicles were ubiquitous. 

“A few cops were creating awareness on Covid-19 for some cars, leading to traffic hold-ups,” recalled a person who was stopped at Lawley Road junction. “ What is the point of keeping shops and bakeries open till 1 am if we cant go to buy what we want?” asked K Naveena, a resident of Trichy Road who was stopped at Singanallur. 

Later in the day, the police commissioner’s office instructed all cops including inspectors, sub inspectors and constables to be on road patrol and station themselves near at major traffic junctions. According to the circular, every day from 9 am to 9.30 am, from 10.30 am to 11 am, from 12 pm to 12.30 pm and again from 5.30 pm to 6.15 pm police will stop all vehicles at various points and explain them on Covid-19 related safety aspects.
