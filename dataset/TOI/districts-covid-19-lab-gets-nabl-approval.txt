2020-04-21
Nashik: The first Covid-19 testing laboratory in Nashik district is likely to start functioning from Thursday after it got the approval from National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL).

“The much-awaited approval for the laboratory started at Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre in Adgaon has come. With this we will now be able to start the process of testing the throat swab samples for Covid-19,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said. 

The approval from NABL came hours after the two blind samples provided by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, for the microbiologist and staff of the laboratory were tested successfully. 

AIIMS has been nominated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for real time (RT) PCR test for Covid-19 and it imparted the training to microbiologist and two technicians at the Nashik-based lab.

“Two blind samples were tested successfully under the watchful eyes of experts from AIIMS through video conferencing. This is a big step towards starting the facility at the earliest,” Mrunal Patil, dean of Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, said.

The testing kits are likely to be available by Wednesday. “We are likely to receive around 3,000 testing kits. Though the number may vary, we are also trying to source the kits at the earliest so that the laboratory starts functioning and there is lesser load on the laboratories where sample testings are currently being conducted,” Kumar Ashirwad, assistant collector, said.
