Coronavirus sent AsiaPac air traffic plummeting 50%, to hit EU & North America now

Hyderabad: The Coronavirus scare has sent air traffic nosediving over 50% in Asia Pacific region and is now expected to hit traffic in other regions like Europe and North America, a top Boeing official said here on Friday.

“The domestic mainland China market in normal operations you see about 15,000 departures a day and at the peak of the virus they were operating right around 3,000 flights a day, so it’s about an 80% decline,” Darren Hulst, vice-president, commercial marketing, Boeing said while sharing air traffic data between January 24 and March 6.

“If you exclude China, in the rest of the Asia Pacific market, probably there are about 5,000 flights and at one point in time we saw about 2,500 flights…so it gives a sense of the scale of what happened,” he told newspersons at the ongoing Wings India 2020.

Hulst said in areas such as Europe and North America, where the virus is spreading, several airlines have started cutting capacities due to changes in policies on passenger admissions. “I think we are going to see similar reduction in capacities by airlines for a very short period of time, not necessarily the magnitude of China.”

Hulst, however, said fast containment was the key to ensuring a quick recovery of the global aviation market, which is very resilient and should be able to shrug off the effects of Covid-19 to get back on the growth track by the end of 2020.

“The faster containment happens, even with a deep drop in demand for the short term, the faster we see that market recover…because the longer it lingers, the longer you see an impact to aviation demand,” he explained. He said there were no deferments in deliveries of aircraft by airlines so far.

Boeing India president Salil Gupte said Boeing plans to double its sourcing from India, which currently stands at over US$ one billion per annum from over 200 suppliers.
