Hyderabad: Childline team members in Hyderabad, who play a decisive role in rescuing vulnerable children across the state, say they have been struggling to find shelter for rescued children and transportation for ChildLine staff due to the government imposed lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. 

Speaking to TOI, Y Madhavi, district coordinator and in-charge of Hyderabad Childline said, “After the lockdown was announced, we have rescued children in three sexual abuse cases, two physical abuse cases and a few medical help cases. We are getting at least two or three cases every day and the main problem we are facing while attending these cases is transportation and shelter.” 

ChildLine teams also said that transportation for staff is becoming an issue as they are not being allowed to go anywhere using private transportation. Palsa Chennaiah, Railway Childline coordinator, Kacheguda child helpdesk said, “We have been facing difficulty like other Childline teams when it comes to transportation. We are planning to go and ask police for an ID card that will help us travel to attend emergency recues during the lockdown period.”

Nimboliadda Center in-charge and superintendent Maithili said, “As of now we have 44 children in the shelter, and we are denying new admissions as a precaution to contain the spread of Covid-19 cases. We are also ensuring that the staff are using sanitizers before they enter the premises. 

“In case there are new rescues, we are asking the Childline teams to get the necessary medical tests done and take them to Sakhi centers until we get the test results,” she added.
