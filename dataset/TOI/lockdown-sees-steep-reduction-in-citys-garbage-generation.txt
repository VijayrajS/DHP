Lockdown sees steep reduction in city’s garbage generation
2020-04-13
Nagpur: The quantum of garbage collected in the city has reduced by 126.51 tonnes or 10.87% per day in March compared with average of January and February apparently due to the ongoing lockdown. If compared with average of 1,255 tonnes per day (TPD) collected last year, the reduction is 218.5 TPD or 17.41%.

The state government had imposed lockdown in four cities of the state including Nagpur from March 21. Then, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a complete national lockdown from March 25.

NMC deputy commissioner (sanitation) Dr Pradeep Dasarwar told TOI, “There is huge difference on the roads as far as garbage is concerned since the lockdown started. People are not coming out on the roads so garbage has reduced. Excluding vegetable waste, not much garbage is coming from market areas as most shops are also closed. NMC has continued door-to-door collection of garbage and sweeping of roads on regular basis,” he said.

The civic body’s two garbage operators — AG Enviro and BVG India — collected 32,131.75 tonnes in 31 days in March for a daily average of 1,036.50 TPD. Average collection was 1,255 TPD last year.

NMC collected 1,180.52 TPD in January and 1,145.50 TPD in February or an average of 1,163.01 TPD. Garbage collection was 21,651.8 tonnes or 1,082.59 TPD between March 1 and 20.

In the lockdown period which is from March 21 to 31, the garbage collection was 10,479.95 tonnes or 952.72 TPD. The difference is 302.28 TPD or 24.09% if quantum of 10-day lockdown period is compared with average of last year.

Dr Dasarwar added, “NMC also began cleaning rivers and nullahs across the city. The garbage and silt being removed from rivers and nullahs are transported by NMC’s own vehicles and not through garbage operators. NMC is not allowing two garbage operators to transport demolition and construction materials too. The entire solid waste being collected and transported by two garbage operators is coming from roads and households only,” he said.
