Dehradun: The number of novel coronavirus positive patients in the state rose to 91 on Saturday with both Dehradun and US Nagar reporting four cases each and Nainital one. With nine cases, this is the biggest spike in the state ever in one day.

All the 25 cases reported in the last one week are returnees from other states.

Dr NS Khatri, Covid-19 nodal officer at Government Doon Medical College, said that two of those who tested positive in Dehradun on Saturday are children aged 10 and 15 years. 

Similarly, Dr Shailja Bhatt, chief medical officer of Udham Singh Nagar, said that two migrants, both 18-year-old, tested positive at the border while they were on their way back from Maharashtra and Gurgaon respectively. “They were screened at the border and later quarantined. They were shifted to Susheela Tiwari Medical College later in the evening,” she added.

According to health officials, two people who returned to Jaspur from Mumbai too tested positive on Saturday. In Nainital, a person who returned from Delhi was also found to be a confirmed case of the virus. 

The state has 39 active cases at present while 51 have recovered from the infection. At present, the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in the state is 57.95% and the doubling rate 18.82 days. Health officials said that the results of 680 samples are awaited as of 2 pm on Saturday.

With the influx of scores of migrants from other parts of the country, most cases are being reported from districts that were earlier classified as ‘green’ and ‘orange’ zones. Haridwar, which was categorized as a ‘red’ zone, has not reported any new case in the last one month and the lone Covid-19 patient who was being treated in the district has also recovered from the infection. 

According to the health department, the categorisation of districts were last done on April 30.
