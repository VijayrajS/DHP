2020-04-15
Udhagamandalam: Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya on Tuesday said there was no dearth of essential commodities, grocery items and medicines in the district. 

She said, “There is no need for the people to panic. We have adequate essential and grocery items and medicines in store to survive the extended lockdown period.” 

Divya had a meeting with wholesale dealers and medical distributors in the district on Monday. She said retail shops would function from 6am to 1pm and bakeries from 10am to 1pm daily. 

To address the issue of crowding of meat stalls during weekends, the district administration has decided to close the same at the Ooty municipal market on Saturdays and Sundays during the lockdown period. 

“However, they will function as usual during weekdays from 8am to 1pm. To bring down the crowd and help senior citizens, we have also introduced door delivery of meat within Ooty municipal limits during weekdays. People are requested to utilize the facility,” the collector said. 

She advised the senior citizens not to come out unnecessarily. “Face mask is a must when people come out. Action will be taken against the people who are not wearing them.” 

Pointing out that the nine Covid-19 patients from the district have been showing improvement, Divya said, “After the next test, steps will be taken to bring them to step down wards.” 

The number of people who are in home quarantine in the district has meanwhile come down to 232 from 1,351. “The others have completed 28 days of isolation period. We are, however, monitoring around 800 people, who had travelled to other parts of the state after obtaining e-pass,” Divya said.
