Over 500 Indian medical students stuck at Kazakhstan due to Covid-19 threat
2020-03-22
Dehradun: More than 500 Indian students — who had been studying MBBS and medical-related courses at universities in Kazakhstan — are unable to return home due to travel services being disrupted on account of the Covid-19 threat. One of the students who is stuck at Almaty, one of the largest cities in Kazakhstan, told TOI over phone, “There are more than 5000 Indian students enrolled in different medical universities of Kazakhstan with a large chunk of them being from Rajasthan. Around 2000 Indian students have decided that they will be staying in their hostels in Kazakhstan until the Covid-19 threat passes over. Some had already left but there are over 500 students who wish to return but can’t because travel services have been disrupted.” 

The student added that flights to India are being suspended from March 22 and on the same day, Kazakhstan is also stopping inter-state travel.

Zain Khan, a medical student, added, “Our college is in Semey and from there, coming to Almaty takes almost 24 hours by train. Many of us had booked our flights between March 22 to 28 but due to restriction on foreign flights to India in that period, all of them got cancelled. We can’t go back to our hostel in Semey as inter-state travel is banned from Sunday and even if we reach our hostel somehow, the management won’t allow us to enter the campus as they will send us to the medical centre where we will be put in self-isolation for at least two weeks.” 

Shahrukh, another medical student, further said that most students are hard-pressed for funds and “not much help has also been forthcoming from the Indian embassy.”
