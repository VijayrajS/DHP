Coronavirus: When do I wear a mask?
2020-04-05
In its latest advisory, the government has urged people to wear "homemade face covers", particularly when they step out of their houses in order to curb the spread of Covid-19.

In the 'Advisory on the use of Homemade Protective Cover for Face and Mouth', the government said the use of such masks will help in protecting the community at large, and that certain countries have claimed benefits of homemade face masks for the general public.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US also recommends wearing of cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (eg, grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.

It is critical to emphasize that aside from wearing masks, maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.
