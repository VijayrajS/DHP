Mumbai: Over 4 crore women Jan Dhan Yojana accountholders have availed a monthly payout of Rs 500 as part of the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana — a relief package in view of the lockdown following the coronavirus outbreak.

Over the next few days, the over 20 crore women will receive the same amount as part of the package in their basic bank accounts. To ensure social distancing and a phased withdrawal by the beneficiaries, the ministry said the government has prepared a schedule for withdrawal from banks based on the last digit of the account numbers.

Many rural branches had placed markers outside branches to ensure accountholders maintained distancing. While banks said they had made arrangements for orderly withdrawal, there were instances of overcrowding. Some branches also faced pressure because it coincided with pensioners coming to collect their monthly payment.

Several public sector banks made the use of business correspondents or ‘bank mitras’ to help disburse the relief amount. “Rural Development Ministry is releasing the lump sum amounts of Rs 500 per woman to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) account holders for April 2020 and the same have been credited to the designated accounts of individual banks on April 2, 2020,” the ministry said in a statement.
