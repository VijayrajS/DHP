Varanasi: Minor relaxations in restrictions will be visible from Monday onwards, as Lockdown 4 has come to an end. Extension of market opening hours and permission to run e-rickshaws in the bylanes of the city are some of themn. 

DM Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “The markets will now be open from 8 am to 7 pm, but the shops will continue with the formula of left lane-right lane and odd-even as it proved to be effective in the fourth phase of the lockdown.”

Till the end of lockdown-4, the administration had allowed the markets to be open only till 5 pm.

With regard to public transport, DM Sharma said, “The UPSRTC will star operating its buses. However, within the city limits, only e-rickshaw operation is allowed for a few days. After SP (traffic) finalises new traffic plans, auto-rickshaws will also begin to ply on road. The entry of heavy vehicles on city roads will remain completely banned.”

“Plans for all other services and reopening of offices are being finalised as per the guidelines issued by the state government,” added Sharma.
