2020-03-08
JAIPUR: While the coronavirus (Covid-19) has triggered frantic search for masks, increased number of children are reaching schools covering their face and nose as a precautionary measure.


Noticing that masks have sold in higher prices than its usual cost, the health department has decided to make people aware when to wear it.

The prices of masks increased with the spike in demand following two Italian tourists tested positive for Covid-19 in the city recently. “You need not wear a mask. It is sad to hear that healthy children are reaching schools wearing masks. There are guidelines of ministry of health and family welfare on use of masks, which says that wear a mask only if you feel unwell or have cough, fever and difficulty in breathing,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health).

The World Health Organisation (WHO) too has issued advisory on use of mask for Covid-19. WHO says, “If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection. Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing. Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.”
