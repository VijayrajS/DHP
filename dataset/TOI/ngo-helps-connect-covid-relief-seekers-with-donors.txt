NGO in Goa helps connect Covid relief seekers with donors
2020-04-24
PANAJI: During the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown, if any person is looking for relief services such as food, medicine, shelter and counselling, Covid relief service directory - a unique online initiative launched by Goa based NGO, Anyay Rahit Zindagi (ARZ), promises to be of assistance.


Through http://covidrelief.in/, any person or family who requires relief services will be connected to relief service providers, by giving them information about relief services at the level of a local block or taluka. Arun Pandey, director at ARZ said the idea of the Covid relief dictionary kicked off after a native of Bihar who survived commercial sexual exploitation called an Arz social worker about not having money for rations due to the lockdown. Arz ended up transferring money to her account which helped her buy food.

After checking with other survivors who were rescued in Goa from commercial sexual exploitation, the team realised that mostwere without rations, and had no money to purchase medicines or pay rent. Arz then decided to connect the survivors with the relief services in their neighbourhoods. 

Pandey said many families in India in need of relief services, and are unable to access these, even though there are many government agencies, NGOs and individuals providing such services.
