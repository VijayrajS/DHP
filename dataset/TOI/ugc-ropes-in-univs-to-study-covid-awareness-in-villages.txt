Lucknow: After seeking participation of universities and higher education institutions in a study on AYUSH practices for treatment of Covid-19, the central government has now asked them to facilitate a study on Covid-19 awareness in villages and best strategies adopted by them in combating challenges.

In a directive issued to all universities and other higher education institutions on Friday, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked all universities and colleges to facilitate study of 5-6 villages adjoining their institutions or those adopted by them.

The participating villages will provide information on awareness levels about Covid-19 and how they braved the challenges. Institutions have been asked to find out the best strategies adopted by villages.

The circular issued by UGC secretary Rajnish Jain highlights the readiness of the government in fighting Covid-19 pandemic. “The government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure constant, consistent and credible communication to provide public health guidance to citizens,” the circular read.

“The pivotal task is to protect village community which hosts millions of habitants in lakhs of villages. The study is required to effectively address the pressing need to sensitively analyze the impact of pandemic and the role played by communities in agrarian parts of the country,” the circular said.

Welcoming the move, Lucknow University vice-chancellor Prof Alok Rai said, “This exercise will have two-fold impact. There will be an increased level of awareness in villages and it will be a major step towards constructive engagement of faculty and students for a social cause.

UGC has also asked higher education institutions to facilitate a parallel study on the impact of H1N1 pandemic or Spanish Flu on India. All study reports will have to be submitted latest by June 30 on the University Activity Monitoring Portal.
