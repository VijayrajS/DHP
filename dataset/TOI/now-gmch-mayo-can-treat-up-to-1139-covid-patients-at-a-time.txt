Nagpur: In a major relief amid steep rise in patients, two state-run hospitals — Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) — have ramped up their capacity to treat Covid-19 patients to 1,139. At present, 201 patients are undergoing treatment at these two hospitals, three have died and 92 discharged out of total 296 cases in the district.With the help of funds sanctioned by guardian minister Nitin Raut and collector Ravindra Thakare, state’s public works department led by chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar and superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh converted a G+2 storey vacant building in GMCH into Dedicated Covid-19 Hospital (DCH) in just 15 days and handed it over to GMCH administration on Sunday. The entire building is a special ICU ward with 120 beds.Earlier, PWD had converted GMCH’s trauma care centre of G+3 floors into DCH with 262 beds (ICU-50 and 212 high dependency unit) within 150 hours. GMCH administration has already brought this building into use.GMCH was having capacity of 91 Covid-19 beds before these two new DCHs. Thus, total capacity in the GMCH as of date is 473 beds.PWD has received Rs5.59 crore for GMCH. Works to convert ward nos 25 and 26 into ICU with 60 beds and ward nos 1, 2, 11-16 into HDU are going on.Sardeshmukh told TOI, “A centralized oxygen bank and suction facility have been developed at GMCH. A new pathway has been constructed along with repairing of internal roads,” he said.IGGMCH was having capacity of 120 beds including 20 in ICU. PWD in association with IGGMCH administration converted entire Surgical Building into DCH with total 566 (ICU- 172 and HDU- 394) beds. Works on 546 beds with 152 in ICU and 394 in HDU were completed in 21 days from April 16 to May 6 at a cost of Rs 3.50 crore sanctioned by Raut and Thakare. Here too, centralized oxygen bank and suction facility have been developed.IGGMCH deputy medical superintendent Sagar Pande said, “We will continue to use earlier 100 beds in ward nos 4-7 and 24. Now, IGGMCH’s total capacity is 666,” he said.IGGMCH probably has the highest capacity in Central India. The plan is to facilitate 34 more beds.Debadwar and Sardeshmukh attributed the result to round-the-clock work by team of PWD comprising executive engineer Rajkumar Jaiswal, deputy engineers Pramod Wankhede, Ramteke, junior engineers Sanjay Upadhyay and Sambhavi Chachire and consultant Milind Soni.Thakare had identified three trust-run hospitals having 1,320 beds.Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe is converting the NMC’s five hospitals and health centres into DCH with capacity of 450 beds. Administration will requisition private hospitals if all these 3,003 beds get full.
