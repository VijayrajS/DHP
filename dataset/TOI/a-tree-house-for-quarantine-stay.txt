Ayodhya: A tree house for quarantine stay
2020-05-24
AYODHYA: Two migrant workers, who returned to Ayodhya from Mumbai in a Shramik Special train last week, hit upon a novel idea to quarantine themselves by building a scaffolding (machan) atop a 25-foot tall mango tree, replete with facilities, including a cot and solar panel to charge their mobiles. The unique tree quarantine unit of the two youths, Gulsher and Mahtab, helped overcome space constraint in their homes while keeping families safe from virus spread.

The tree-houses on village outskirts have bamboo cots neatly placed between strong branches, strung with mosquito nets and complete with household infrastructure like water coolers, utensils, potable water in drums, solar mobile charges and even a prayer rug.

Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said, the health department has accepted the self-isolation units atop the mango tree and pasted the quarantine order on the tree trunk.

“We do not have symptoms of coronavirus, but as a precautionary measure we have quarantined ourselves far away from the village to keep our families protected,” said Mahtab.

“Our families provide us with food wrapped in paper, which we burn after eating. We clean utensils and maintain social distancing when they come with food,” he said.
