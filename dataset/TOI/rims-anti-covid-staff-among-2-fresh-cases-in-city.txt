RANCHI: Jharkhand recorded two new Covid-19 cases, both from Ranchi, on Thursday. One of them is a frontline anti-Covid worker posted at Rims. A total of 768 samples were tested on Wednesday, including 18 at private labs. The testing figure is the highest for the state since the outbreak.


State health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni said: “A total of 750 samples were tested across four centres and two people from Ranchi tested positive for Covid-19. One is a healthcare worker from our Covid-19 hospital at RIMS and another is a resident of Hindpiri area.”

Of the two cases, one is a 25 year old female from the containment zone of Hindpiri while the other is a 52-year-old nursing at Rimswho was under quarantine after weeklong duty. The Hindpiri woman was tested during a door-to-door screening campaign a couple of days ago.

Rims director Dr D K Singh said: “One of our nursing staff has been diagnosed with the viral infection and she has been shifted to our isolation centre for treatment. She was under quarantine at a city hotel. The hospital is being sanitized and we will collect samples of other health workers housed at that facility.”

Meanwhile, four of the nine patients who recovered on Tuesday were discharged from RIMS on Wednesday and were advised to stay in home quarantine for 14 days.
