2020-04-23
Mumbai: The Covid-19 crisis, which has affected almost all arms of the country, has reportedly spared its nuclear establishment. 

Officials at the department of atomic energy told TOI on Wednesday that its 22 nuclear power plants were functioning normally across the country.

“The engineers and scientists were working in shifts and social distancing norms are being followed,” an official said, adding that these units were located in zones that are not crowded. They said that the Dhruva research reactor at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) in Trombay was also operating normally.

They said Dhruva cannot be shut down because it makes isotopes and also, this reactor is related to the defence sector.

“Barc has been declared an essential service,” an official said. 

With regards to Isro, the coronavirus crisis has resulted in rescheduling of some missions and also Yuvika 2020, a programme launched this year by the space agency for students.
