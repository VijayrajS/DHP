Power consumption sees dip amid coronavirus lockdown in Telanagana
2020-03-31
HYDERABAD: The power demand this March has been surprisingly low. Unlike March last year, summer spell this time has not been harsh which could be a factor behind the dip with Hyderabad and Telangana experiencing unseasonal rains this month, temperatures have not zoomed and maintained a steady course. Officials said this had also resulted in power demand usage going down. 


 Residents said with much cooler evenings, their AC usage had come down considerably. 

It was a different worry for 25-year-old techie Vishesh from Madhapur. “I purchased an AC recently, just before the lockdown was announced. I could not get it installed as the technician cannot come out because of the restrictions on account of the coronavirus lockdown,” Vishesh said. 

The Kaleshwaram pumphouse demand reached a peak of 13,168 megawatts on February 28 this year. Though the power demand has come down in Hyderabad, the demand in erstwhile Warangal, Khammam and Karimnagar districts where irrigation projects are running to near full capacity, has not come down.
