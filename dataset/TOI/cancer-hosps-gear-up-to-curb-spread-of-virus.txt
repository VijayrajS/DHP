Varanasi: In view of coronavirus threat, Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital, Lahartara, and Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre (BHU) have geared up to protect cancer patients from the virus.

The two cancer hospitals are run by Tata Memorial Centre.

Chief administrative officer of both the hospitals Madho Singh said, “A meeting was convened to discuss measures required to keep cancer patients safe from coronavirus infection.”

Assistant medical superintendent of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital Dr Akash Anand Srivastava said, “Considering the risk of coronavirus infection, precautionary measures have been adopted for registered cancer patients and their attendants.”

He said the screening of patients would be done by a team of doctors at the main entrance of the hospital to prevent unnecessary crowd in the hospital. “Only one attendant will be allowed with a patient,” he added.

For patients whose treatment is complete, follow up will be done after April 15, 2020. In this regard, regular SMS are being sent to patients requesting them to come after April 15 for regular follow up.

Patients registered before August 1, 2019, are supposed to have completed their treatment, hence, they are being asked to come after April 30, 2020, for regular follow up.

Srivastava said cancer-related emergency services and registration of new cancer patients and treatment would continue as usual. “Patients who have been registered after August 1, 2019, will continue their follow up regularly. Among these patients, who are not undergoing active treatment are requested to come to the hospital after April 15, 2020, for follow-up,” he said.

“Patients who have any symptoms of cough and fever have been asked to avoid visiting the hospital with cancer patients and may contact district hospital or corona unit,” Srivastava said.
