A small, slim Gujarati wedding during lockdown
2020-05-26
AHMEDABAD: Sachin Shah and Stuti Kinariwala will have a distinctive story to tell about their marriage. Their families planned a big, fat wedding for April 28 this year. One lockdown led to another, and the marriage date lapsed. Finally, the marriage did take place on Monday, but with just nine persons in attendance – four from each family and a priest.

Both the families were elated as the marriage was finally solemnized. Both families had to make several online applications and even personally visit government offices in their respective districts to seek approval for the marriage. While Sachin’s family lives at Thangadh in Surendranagar district, Stuti’s family stays in Ahmedabad.

“The lockdown kept extending and the original date for the marriage got lapsed. We had got wedding invitations printed and distributed. We had planned a grand wedding but we are happy that it has finally been held,” said Mitul Shah, Sachin’s father. Mitul Shah and his family drove to Ahmedabad from Surendranagar, completed the marriage ceremony in Ahmedabad and returned with the newly-wed couple.

Sachin, who currently works with an export company, and Stuti, studied together in Ahmedabad and grew close to each other. When they informed their families of their relationship, the families got together and finalized their marriage on April 28. “When the first lockdown was announced from March 23, we thought things will become normal by the time the marriage date arrived, but the lockdown kept extending,” Mitul Shah said.

He added that both families kept applying for permission online, so that they could solemnize the marriage, but they did not get the required permission from the authorities of the two districts. Finally, when they got the permission, the marriage was possible.
