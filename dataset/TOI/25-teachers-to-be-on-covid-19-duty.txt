DEHRADUN: The Doon district administration has decided to depute 25 teachers from the state education department for coordinating the community surveillance of Covid-19 suspected cases. 


The teachers are being deputed in addition to 200 ASHA workers who are helping in community surveillance of 53,949 people. The 25 teachers will support the community surveillance in areas such as Lakhibagh, Muslim colony, Kargi Grant, Banjarawala and Keshavpuri.

In addition, there will be restriction on the sale of medicines for regular cold and cough to customers without a valid prescription. District magistrate Ashish Srivastava said, “We are ensuring that the medical store owners help us keep a record of people coming to buy medicines for cold and cough. The stores have been asked to maintain the address details of the customers buying such medicines. The same must be communicated to the office of chief medical officer for preventive measures.”

Private medical clinics have also been asked to report to the administration in case a patient with Covid-19-like symptoms visits a doctor.
