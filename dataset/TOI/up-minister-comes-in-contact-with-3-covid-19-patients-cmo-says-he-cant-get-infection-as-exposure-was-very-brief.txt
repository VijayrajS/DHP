MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh’s finance and medical education minister Suresh Khanna unknowingly came in contact with three Covid-19 patients during his visit to Meerut’s Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College on Monday, the district health authorities said on Wednesday.

The three patients’ Covid-19 report arrived on Wednesday, after which the health authority went into fire-fighting mode. The chief medical officer (CMO) of Meerut, Dr Raj Kumar, said that the minister stayed in the ward for just few minutes and it was unlikely that he may have caught the infection.

“The time period for which the minister and the BJP leaders were in proximity to the said patients was not much. For transmission of infection, at least 15 minutes of exposure is needed,” the CMO said.

Apart from Khanna, some local BJP workers including Vineet Sharda and Sunil Bharala also visited the ward. Tailing them was a battery of media persons who also entered the ward where the three patients were admitted.

Meanwhile, the health department officials assured that the symptoms of the all the people, who came in contact with the three infected patients, will be checked for the next five days. “If they show any symptoms in the next five days, they will be sent for testing and treated according to the standard operating procedures,” said CMO Kumar.
