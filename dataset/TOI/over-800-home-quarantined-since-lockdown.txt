Nashik: Over 800 people have entered the city by illegal means ever since the lockdown was imposed, district authorities have said. The health teams of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have been stamping such people for home quarantine from time to time. 

According to senior civic officials, over 200 people are currently placed under home quarantine for a period of 14 days.

Rajendra Tryambake, health officer of the municipal corporation, said, “Our teams are currently on the move to check if there are people coming into the city from other parts of the district or the state. We have a mobile application in which people can report if some person from outside the city has arrived in their vicinity. At the same time, people also bring such incidents to the notice of the disaster management cell from where we are instructed to check the concerned residences.”

Tryambake said that the teams consisting of doctors and nurses visit the concerned residences and verify if someone from outside the district has arrived there. If any such person is found, his medical check-up is done immediately. The person is then home-quarantined for a period of 14 days. 

Civic officials said that if the spread of Covid-19 has to be controlled, people will have to be extremely disciplined. They have to strictly adhere to the lockdown norms set down by the police authorities as well as the government. If people keep neglecting the lockdown orders, new cases of Covid-19 would keep on emerging and newer areas of the city would keep on getting under the containment zone areas, he said.
