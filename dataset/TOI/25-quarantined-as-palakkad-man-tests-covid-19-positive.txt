PALAKKAD: The swabs and blood samples collected from a 70-year-old man from Nurani in the district, who died in a private hospital in Coimbatore on Friday, tested positive for Covid-19, sparking panic among relatives, neighbours and health department authorities as it is suspected that he had come into contact with hundreds of people.

As many as 25 people, including a doctor and 19 nurses of the hospital in Coimbatore and his family members in Nurani have been sent to quarantine.

His wife and son were admitted to the isolation ward of the district hospital here while other close relatives have been kept under observation. Their swab samples have been sent for testing, said district medical officer Dr K P Reetha.

She said the Nurani nativeâ€™s name was not included while compiling the Covid-19 tally of the state. Tamil Nadu has also not included him in its death list as he had come from Palakkad for treatment.

The travel details of the man show that he was at the cash counter of his hardware shop at the main whole sale market in the city and interacted with at least 50-100 customers till March 25 on a daily basis. 

He used to frequent the fruits godown opposite his hardware shop as well, sources said. Lorries from north India arrive at the godown frequently at nights.

On March 25, he developed abdominal pain and vomiting and was taken to Lakshmi Hospital in a car by his son. He consulted doctors at Palakkad Diabetic Centre after the symptoms persisted and was referred to a hospital in Coimbatore, where he got admitted on April 2.

On April 5, he developed chest pain and was shifted to Chennai Hospital in Coimbatore and was put on ventilator. He tested positive for Covid-19 on April 8 and died on April 10. On April 11 his second swab also tested positive.
