Kerala: Devotees and conduct of exams exempted from Sunday lockdown
2020-06-14
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has amended its order on the total lockdown for Sundays, allowing devotees to travel to places of worship and conduct of examinations.


An order issued by chief secretary Vishwas Mehta said the government has excluded the movement of devotees from their homes to places of worship and back. This comes in the wake of the Centre permitting places of worships to open, from June 8, as part of its easing of restrictions, and the state government issuing necessary orders in this regard.

The latest government order also allows for the conduct of exams -- and by extension the movement of students and personnel for organizing and conducting the same. They will be allowed to move with their admit cards and identity cards, respectively, it said.

The order also permits movement of students to join their educational institutions, allotted medical or dental colleges, with their allotment cards being treated as travel passes. The order also asks district collectors and SPs to make necessary arrangements and issue necessary orders to comply with the exemptions.

However, other existing restrictions will continue. Shops selling essential goods and those collecting and distributing milk, hospitals, laboratories, medical stores, Covid-19 work-related departments and agencies engaged in removal of waste are already exempt from the Sunday shutdown.

Take-away services in restaurants are permitted. The Sunday lockdown will also not be applicable to those attending weddings and funerals. Persons out on medical requirements, and those engaged in Covid-19-related duties and media have also been exempted. 

Any other public activity will be permitted only on the basis of special permits issued by police or other concerned officials.
