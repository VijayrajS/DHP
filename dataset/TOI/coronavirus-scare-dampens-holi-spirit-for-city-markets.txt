DEHRADUN: The coronavirus scare seems to have dampened the Holi spirit in the markets of the state capital.Traders in most major markets in Doon say that the consumer rush is comparatively lower than earlier years attributing it to the coronavirus scare.

Nafeez, who runs a shop in Paltan Bazaar, told TOI, “The demand of gulal and other Holi products has gone down considerably. People fear that the use of ‘made in China’ Holi products may lead to an outbreak of the fatal disease.”

Another local trader told TOI, “It has been a week since we kept Holi stuff in our shop but only a few people have come to buy them so far. The rain spells and the fear of coronavirus have brought down our sales. Further, ongoing school examinations are also a major factor contributing to lower sales.”

People fear that the use of made in China Holi products may lead to an outbreak of the fatal disease, say traders. Several social media posts which are being widely circulated state that “Chinese Holi goods are infected with the coronavirus”. 

“The markets do not have that much imported goods and this is a completely fake rumour. Our stock has come from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. We are confident of a growth in sales after the weather gets clear,” a local businessman told TOI. The regional WHO representative has also refuted such rumours clearing that the virus does not last long on surface of objects, so it is unlikely that imported goods would be infectious.

At present, face masks are enjoying greater sales than Holi products in the city. The price of Holi products that are made in India has also increased by 30-35% as people are avoiding the purchase of Chinese goods. “A packet of balloons which used to cost Rs 40 per packet earlier now cost Rs 80 per unit. Similarly, the cost of water guns have gone up from Rs 50-Rs 60 to Rs 150-Rs 200,” said a local trader.
