Sale of paan, tobacco products prohibited

The district administration has announced a ban on the sale of all paan (beetle-leaves), tobacco and related products from Thursday. Orders issued by Suraj Mandhare, the Nashik District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) president and collector, pointed out that spit can transmit the virus and since people who consume paan or tobacco products often spit in the open, the chances of others catching the virus become high. Therefore, the sale of these products has been completely banned till March 31, the DDMA order said.
