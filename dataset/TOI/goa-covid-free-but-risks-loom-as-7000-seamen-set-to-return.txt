Goa Covid-free, but risks loom as 7,000 seamen set to return
2020-04-20
PANAJI: Goa on Sunday became the first state to be free of Covid-19 patients for the moment as the seventh patient recovered from the virus. The tiniest state has not reported a single Covid-19 case since April 3 and all seven patients — six with travel history, and the seventh the brother of one of the patients — have now recovered.


“It is a moment of satisfaction and relief for Goa, but we can’t relax. The state will continue to be on a high alert since cases have risen in Belagavi. The borders will remain sealed and all those coming into Goa will be put under quarantine,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. Belagavi is an important link for Goa as it is from here that the state procures most of its vegetable and fruit supply.

There are also fears that Goa could find itself on the back foot again with almost 7,000 seafarers now preparing to return to the state. “Seafarers must be quarantined for 28 days. People having viral diseases should be screened,” said Dr Anil Mehndiratta, TB and chest physician.
