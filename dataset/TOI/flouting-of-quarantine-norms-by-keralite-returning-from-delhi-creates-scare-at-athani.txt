2020-05-29
Thrissur: A 46-year old man who had reportedly moved around violating quarantine norms after coming from Delhi by train created a scare in Athani area near Wadakkanchery. He was later sent for quarantine by police and residents.

Naduppathil Rajesh of Kurichikkanam in Kottayam district reportedly came by Rajadhani Express and got down at Ernakulam in the wee hours of Thursday, police said. He came to Thrissur as there was no quarantine facility near his house, according to police. He reached Thrissur by bus around 6am and took a taxi up to Athani, where he had worked as a security person at a shopping complex.

Rajesh had reportedly told police he was planning to stay at Athani or go to the place of a Swamy at Desamangalam. When he was trying to have a bath at the pond attached to Kuttiyankavu Temple, the children around there grew suspicious and did not allow him to take a bath. Subsequently he hitch-hiked on a bike to Athani and went to two ATMs there and had tea from a hotel there.

By then police and health officials reached the spot and took him to the Medical College Hospital in an ambulance. However, since Rajesh was carrying medical certificates from Delhi stating that he was not suffering from any ailments, he was shifted to an ashram at Kondayur in an ambulance. The health authorities subsequently sanitised the ATMs.

By then exaggerated stories were being circulated through the social media about the incident, and police have initiated actions against those who spread fake information.
