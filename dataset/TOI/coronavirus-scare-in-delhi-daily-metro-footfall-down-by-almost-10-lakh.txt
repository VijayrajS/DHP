While the month of February saw average footfall of 57.13 lakh per day, the average passenger journeys witnessed till March 15, dipped to 46.53 lakh. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), however, said that this was an annual trend and every year, footfalls dip in the month of March.

“The number of passenger journeys is dependent on various factors at any given point of time like vacations, examinations, monsoon season, festivals, strikes/closures etc. and utilisation follows a monthly pattern accordingly,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC.

“Every year, the month of March witnesses a natural dip of 10-15 % in comparison to the figures for the month of February. However, as government has announced several measures to combat novel coronavirus, which include closure of malls, cinemas, schools, colleges etc., it may be natural to witness some variation in passenger journey figures of Delhi Metro in the coming days,” he said.
