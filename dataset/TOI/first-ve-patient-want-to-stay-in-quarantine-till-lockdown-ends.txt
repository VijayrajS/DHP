Kolhapur: The first Covid-19 case in the city is likely to be discharged on Saturday, however, the man is preferring to stay in institutional quarantine till the lockdown ends.

The Pune-based man came to Kolhapur on March 20 to meet his sister residing in Mangalwar Peth area. He transmitted the infection to his sister, who is also undergoing treatment in the same facility.

The first sample test of the man has tested negative, as the doctors wait for the second test to confirm that he is coronavirus free. “I had come to meet my sister here. Unfortunately, she also got infected. I am based in Pune but I do not want to go to my sister’s home as it may create unnecessary panic among the locals. Also, there is a lockdown in the process. No one knows the nature of the disease currently and I don’t want to risk the health of other people. I do not want to go back home till the lockdown ends,” he told TOI. 

The doctors have advised him the same thing. “There is no chance of growing the infection anymore, the treatment may have made his body less immune and he may get other infections. He should get the strength to travel to long-distance before he is discharged,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity. 

Meenakshi Gajbhiye, Covid-19 control management team said that as per the guidelines we have to put the infected person under strict home quarantine so that he or she may not get reinfected again. “We are waiting for the second swab report of the patient. His sister is going to complete the quarantine period. Her first swab sample has been sent for testing too,” said Gajbhiye. 

Meanwhile, all the 19 swab samples of the Kasba Bawda and Shahuwadi tehsil suspects have reported negative, which has relieved the health staff. These are the people, who had come in contact with the positive cases from the said areas.
