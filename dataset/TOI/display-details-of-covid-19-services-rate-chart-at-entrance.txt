2020-06-14
Aurangabad: Private as well as government-run hospitals and clinics have been ordered to put Covid-19 details, including the rate chart, visibly on display on LED screens at their respective entrances.

As per the order issued by revenue divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes will have to display the total number of beds reserved and available for Covid as well as non-Covid patients, number of patients being treated in both categories, treatment charges, number of available rooms, details of recovered and discharged Covid-19 patients, among other relevant data.

Senior revenue authorities unanimously said that Marathwada is the first region in the state to take this step for ensuring transparency at the hospitals.

Kendrekar issued the directives citing need for transparency in the overall process of catering to Covid-19 patients during the current pandemic. The order, a copy of which is with the TOI, also cites the need for the effective implementation of central and state governments’ health schemes for the masses.

When contacted, Kendrekar said, “All collectors, civic body chiefs have been asked to strictly follow these orders in letter and spirit. The order is in the larger interest of the society.”

Going a step ahead, they have also been asked to appoint nodal officers at each of these hospitals to ensure implementation of government guidelines from time to time.
