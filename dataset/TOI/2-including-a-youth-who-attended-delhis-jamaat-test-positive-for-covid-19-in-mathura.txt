AGRA: A 53-year-old woman from Agra and a local youth, who had attended Tablighi Jamaat at Delhi’s Nizamuddin along with 29 others, were tested positive for novel coronavirus in Mathura on Monday.

The woman was admitted to a private hospital in Mathura in a critical condition, while the youth, a resident of Shamli, was referred to a hospital in Agra. 

Mathura’s district magistrate Sarvagya Ram Misra said, “The woman’s condition is critical and she has been put on ventilator.”

Officials said the woman was recently referred to a Mathura hospital from Agra for some other treatment. But, since she appeared symptomatic, her sample was sent for testing. Efforts are now on to track all those who had come in contact with the woman recently.

These would include the staff and doctors of the private hospital in Agra where she was initially admitted. 

While the youth was part of a group of 30 Jamaat members quarantined by the administration on March 31. No one else in the group tested positive for the infection.

Officials are also testing and quarantining people who were in contact with the youth. An area of three kilometre radius around the Markaj mosque in Andhiquiyan and Farah’s mosque is being sanitised. They will also be sealed for a certain period as a precautionary measure.

A medical team will conduct a door-to-door survey in these areas.
