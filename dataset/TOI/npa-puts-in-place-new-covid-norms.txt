2020-05-28
HYDERABAD: With Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA) all set to resume training on its premises at Shivrampalli, the Academy administrators have decided to classify 137 soon to return IPS probationers into three groups — red, orange and green — as part of its precautions to avoid spread of Covid-19. Also, on the 250-acre campus, there will be no group activities, including interaction, dinning and social meetings. The 2018-batch probationary IPS officers, who have already completed district practical training (DPT), are expected to return from different parts of the country to NPA by June 7, while the 2019-batch 150 probationers, who are at the academy and would take their last exam on June 5, would leave for DPT. 


Interestingly, the 137 probationers of the 2018 batch, who were part of the frontline warriors during the Covid-19 in the last two months while undergoing DPT, would be sharing their on-field experiences to the 2019 batch probationers during their upcoming e-classes. 

“We will categorise the cadets into three different groups (red, orange and green) based on factors like the zone from where the cadet returned, what duties he/she performed, health condition, mode of travel and who they contacted and others. Depending on the group, their accommodation will be provided accordingly ,’’ SVPNPA director Atul Karwal told TOI. 

After they return, the 2018 batch cadets would be under quarantine for 10 days, NPA officials said. Later, they would be allowed to take up training. As of now, no decision has been taken on aspects like arms training since
