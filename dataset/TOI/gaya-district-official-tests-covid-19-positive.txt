GAYA: A senior district official tested Covid-19 positive late on Wednesday evening. The official was initially put in isolation at a facility near Bodh Gaya. However, after he complained of uneasiness, he was shifted to Gaya- based Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH), which has been declared as Covid dedicated hospital. Sources said the condition of the official is said to be stable. 

Gaya DM Abhishek Singh, however, said there was no cause to panic. Asked whether officials working in close proximity of Covid-19 positive officer have also been quarantined or isolated, the DM said that prima facie, no such need is felt as the physical distancing norms were strictly maintained at the meetings attended by the said official and the office room was effectively disinfected after each meeting.

In another Covid-19 related development, a criminal case has been instituted against two doctors of ANMMCH on the charge of violating the standard operating procedure (SoP) notified for institutional quarantine of foreign returnees. The case has been registered with the medical college police station.

“The case has been registered under section 188 of the IPC and the provisions of Disaster Management Act,” DM Singh said.

A foreign returnee was allegedly recommended home quarantine instead of institutional quarantine. The two doctors are alleged to have attempted to get the foreign returnee skip the mandatory institutional quarantine. “The home quarantine move was thwarted,” said Naresh Jha, additional district magistrate-cum-nodal officer of Covid management at ANMMCH.

The home quarantine foreign returnee tested Covid positive and the two doctors along with the hospital superintendent were kept in isolation. Meanwhile, the doctors against whom the case has been registered have tested Covid negative.
