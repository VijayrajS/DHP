Congress playing cheap politics during pandemic: Satish Mahana

GORAKHPUR: Industrial development minister Satish Mahana slammed Congress party accusing it of playing cheap politics even in the time of global pandemic.

Addressing a press conference through video conferencing, he said, “Congress party is playing cheap politics even during pandemic as it is in the clutches of one family. Rahul Gandhi makes statements but is not able to explain them and later the entire party explains the meaning.”

“Congress ruled the country for decades and always showcased the poverty in country. When Britain’s PM came to India, they took him to a hut to show poverty in India, while PM Narendra Modi showcases the country’s youth as its strength and as a result the nation’s fame and strength has increased under his guidance,” Mahana added.

Due to right decisions of PM Modi and CM Yogi, Covid-19 is comparatively controlled in our country, he said.

“PM Modi restored the faith of people, hence they gave a huge mandate. They know PM Modi does what he says. He abrogated Article 370 and gave reply to those who alleged that BJP only talks of temple and never gives a date. The government is also tackling terrorism effectively,” he said.

“Yogi was the first CM to assist migrant labourers return to the state during lockdown and helped them reach home. Now, the CM is providing jobs to migrants. We are mapping the skills of migrants so that jobs could be provided to them. Before lockdown, less than one lakh people were working in MNREGS but now more than 41 lakh people are working,” the minister said.

“Government is making all efforts to attract more and more industrialists. We are trying to bring the companies that are leaving China,” he said
