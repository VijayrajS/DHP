Gujarat: Serving Covid-19 patients within a month of marriage
2020-04-10
AHMEDABAD: For Reshmabanu Mansuri, an emergency medical technician (EMT) with EMRI 108 ambulance, the day starts early. She, along with the ambulance pilot wait for any suspected cases of Covid-19 in western city parts. Her ambulance is designated as Covid-19 special that can’t ferry other patients.


“We have to be careful in handling each patient. All could be potential positive cases,” says Mansuri, a native of Idar in Sabarkantha.

She doesn’t give any hint that it’s not even a month that she has got married. EMRI officials said that it were just two days after her marriage in late March that she called up her supervisor and inquired if she could resume duties. “We hope to compensate her with the leaves soon,” said an official.

Jashvant Prajapati, COO of EMRI in Gujarat, said that the staff of emergency services – encompassing 108 ambulances, 104 fever helpline and 1100 health helpline – currently form the backbone of Gujarat’s fight against Covid-19.
