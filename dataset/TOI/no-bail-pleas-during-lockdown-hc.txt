No bail pleas during lockdown: HC
2020-04-01
The Rajasthan High Court directed the registry on Monday to not list any bail pleas as “extremely urgent case” as it had decided that only important matters would be taken up during the lockdown. During a hearing of a second bail application, a single-judge bench of Justice Pankaj Bhandari ordered that no bail application would be listed before the court for hearing.

The bench observed that even during Diwali, Holi and winter breaks, the bail applications were not listed. It asked how come the courts be “forced” to hear a bail application.
