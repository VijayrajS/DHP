Telangana to test only if a primary contact shows coronavirus symptom
2020-05-07
HYDERABAD: Already facing criticism from all quarters for not doing enough tests, the Telangana government has now sent oral instructions to the health department to stop testing asymptomatic primary contacts. As on Wednesday, total cases in the state stood at 1,107 with 11 more — all from greater Hyderabad — testing positive.


Although health experts say that asymptomatic persons can readily pass on the virus to others, top health department sources in the state maintain that they are following the latest guideline from the government for the past few days.

“Earlier direction was that all primary contacts should be tested irrespective of symptoms. But now the mandate is to test primary contacts only if they exhibit Covid-19 symptoms,” said a senior health department source.

This is being done because the recovery rate is very good and death rate low. This is also in tune with all health guidelines,” he added. On Wednesday 20 more people were discharged, taking the count of those released to 668. So far, 29 people have died in the state.

The government says it has flattened the Covid-19 curve a lot and was hopeful of bringing down the numbers by May 15. Suryapet link continues to create worries around Vansthalipuram area, with three members of the family who were secondary contacts of one infected person getting infected. Officials said all cases from the Vanasthalipuram area have been traced to a marriage ceremony in Suryapet. Among the 11 cases on Wednesday, one is a 27-year-old woman and her two minor children. She is the sixth member of the same family to get the virus.
