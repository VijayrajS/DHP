In the past 24 hours, five Covid-19 deaths and 121 new cases have been reported in Indore division, casting a cloud of uncertainty on easing of lockdown after May 3.

Indore division’s bulletin of the day revealed two deaths in Khandwa, one in Khargone and two in Indore.

“Last night, Indore reported two deaths and 94 new positive cases. The figure here has increased to total 65 deaths and 1,466 positive patients” said Indore division joint director (health) Dr JS Awasya, adding that no new case or death was reported in Burhanpur, Jhabua, Alirajpur and Barwani.

NGO Jan Swasth Abhiyam (JSA) has called for immediate action on the spurt seen in the last three days in Khandwa, Raisen and Ashoknagar. These districts have reported deaths recently. Now, 31 districts in MP are on the Corona map.

“The number of dedicated Covid hospitals is stuck at 25 since April 14 and most of them are in cities. It is essential to increase capacity of testing and treatment in all districts,” said JSA representative Amulya Nidhi.

The NGO also pointed out that state government health bulletin has stopped providing the total number of test samples and pending test results since April 27. Till April 26, there were 8,439 pending test results.

“A lot of patients have been waiting for several days for their test results. But now, as there is no data being given on pending test results and availability of test kits. There is no transparency around testing in MP,” he alleged.
