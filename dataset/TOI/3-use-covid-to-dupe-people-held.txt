ERODE: Three men were arrested in Erode on Thursday for trying to dupe people in name of raising money for Covid relief. 


The Erode north police identified the accused as K Venkatapathy, 56, C Girish kumar, 47, and M Krishnamurthy, 35, all from the city. 

Police said one of three men on Wednesday called Sudha Multi Speciality Hospital in the city and introduced himself as a retired judge. He urged Sathish Kumar, an administrative officer, who attended the call, to donate money for Covid-19 relief works. Sathish Kumar collected Rs 1 lakh, Rs 50,000 from hospital staff members and Rs 50,000 on behalf of the hospital management, inspector R Sivakumar said. 

“On Thursday, the three men came to the hospital to collect the money. Though he handed over the money, Kumar grew suspicious of them when he spoke to them,” the inspector said. Immediately, Kumar alerted the police. A police team reached the spot and arrested the trio. 

The police registered a case against the three under sections 271, 419, 420 and 506(1) of the IPC read with Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Section 51(b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. They were lodged at the district prison in Gobichettipalayam. tnn
