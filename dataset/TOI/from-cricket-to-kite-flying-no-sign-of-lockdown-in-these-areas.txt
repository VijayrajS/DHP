From cricket to kite-flying, no sign of lockdown in these areas
2020-04-21
BHOPAL: In some zones of the city, it does not feel like a lockdown. Despite CCTV surveillance through the Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC), there has not been much of a difference in the area. Residents and those involved in emergency services admit that stricter measures are required from the district administration.


A case in point is the Rs 350-crore BRTS corridor. From Roshanpura to Polytechnic Square, the stretch of road is a free for all. “Complaints do not get resolved. One side of the road comes under TT Nagar police station and another falls under Jehangirabad police station. People party and move along the street beyond midnight. It is all recorded in the ITMS cameras installed on the road,” said a local resident, seeking anonymity.

From kite flying to day-and-night cricket matches, to loud music that goes beyond late night has become a norm in the area. Over the last two weeks, some miscreants have removed the iron dividers from the BRTS, he added. The area is near Professors’ Colony, which in a sharp contrast has been declared a Covid-19 containment zone. The slums and other parts of Banganga and Roshanpura are within 2 km of the zone and should be in lockdown. Residents from Ahata Rustam Khan also venture into Priyadarshni park and the BRTS. 

Moving ahead, entry into VIP road is only possible after a security check. However, between the entry and exit points, youngsters roam without restrictions. An ITMS camera has caught two instances of near mishaps. A teenager almost rammed into a moving vehicle while he was chasing a kite. In another instance at Khanugoan, a drone filmed a gathering of more than 25 people near a shop. Complaints to the local police station by the residents has gone unanswered. At most, a Dial- 100 vehicle moves twice a day through the by lanes of Khanugoan. “It seems there is no lockdown here,” said a local resident.
