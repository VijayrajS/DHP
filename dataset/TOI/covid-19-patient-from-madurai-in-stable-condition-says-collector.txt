MADURAI: The 54-year-old man from Madurai, who is suspected to be the first case of community transfer in Tamil Nadu after testing positive for Covid-19, is in a stable condition in the isolation ward at the Government Rajaji Hospital, without ventilator support, said Madurai district collector, Dr T G Vinay. 


Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the collector said the man already suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and in hospital care it was found that his oxygen saturation was decreasing. “We are trying to trace how he contacted the diseases, and his primary contacts are being detected and screened,” he said. The patient is said to have attended his neighbour’s function on March 9 in which about 60 people had attended. His family is also in the isolation ward and being screened for the disease. If they did not have symptoms they would be kept in home quarantine.

The collector also clarified that the travel history of the patient who went to China and some other places about a year was not significant to Covid-19. The patient used to visit a mosque regularly and about 60 people who were his primary contacts have been identified and their health status was being monitored, the collector said.

Meanwhile, seven people with symptoms of Covid-19 have been admitted to the isolation ward of the Government Rajaji Hospital and 439 people in Madurai district are under home quarantine, the collector said. Those in home quarantine with a history of travel have to remain indoors till further instructions from the government and it was an order and not a request, Vinay added.

An inter-departmental team comprising corporation, revenue and police officials has been constituted to monitor people on home quarantine and notices are being put up outside their homes as a precautionary measure.
