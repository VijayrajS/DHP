Uttarakhand: More child births with 108 ambulance help during lockdown
2020-04-10
PITHORAGARH: The 21-day nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic has increased the number of child births with the assistance of Emergency Ambulance Service '108' in Pithoragarh district. They are also helping pregnant women reach hospitals, mainly due to the lack of public transport.


Pithoragarh district has eight blocks and there are nine emergency vehicles - one each in every block, and one in Thal, according to Parmanand Pant, convener of emergency ambulance service in the district.

"In the past two weeks, seven child births took place inside the ambulance, while three are born in normal circumstances," Pant said.

"The main cause of the rise is due to suspension of public and private transport. So, people are more dependent on the 108 services during emergency," Pant said, adding that the district administration has instructed them to maintain a record of contact details of pregnant women and remain in touch, in case of any emergency.

Notably, during the lockdown, the ambulance service has, so far, carried at least 186 pregnant women to District Women’s Hospital in Pithoragarh. "This number is much more than normal times," Pant pointed out.

In '108', two persons are deputed -— a driver and the other an emergency medical technician (EMT) with a diploma in pharma or Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) so that the person can help in the delivery, if needed.

Health department sources said that in Pithoragarh district only three gynecologists are currently working. 

All of them are at the District Lady Hospital. At present, eight primary health centre and community health centre have no gynecologists, sources added. 

A local doctor, however, said that child birth inside '108' is not very safe and every effort should be made for the delivery at hospital.
