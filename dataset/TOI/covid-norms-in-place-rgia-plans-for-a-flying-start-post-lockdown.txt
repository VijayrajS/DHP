2020-05-06
HYDERABAD: The city’s Rajiv Gandhi Internationl Airport (RGIA) is gearing up to start operations post the lockdown. On Tuesday, officials of the GMR-managed facility, issued a detailed document on the various initiatives that are being implemented to cope with the Covid-19 impact. It also listed out precautionary measures that passengers can take to reduce their chances of contracting the virus, once air travel resumes. These include -- web check-in before arriving at the airport, use of self check-in kiosks and digital payments at retail stores. 


Stressing on social distancing, the document stated that it will be followed in every segment of RGIA – departures, arrivals, security check, customs and immigration and even in the buses that ferry passengers from the terminal to the aircraft. For the same reason, all convenience facilities, including prayer rooms and smoking rooms, will be temporarily suspended. 



The airport will provide Hazmat suits to security personnel involved in passenger screening, conduct thermal screening by CISF with automated thermal cameras at all terminal entry points, have hand sanitiser dispensers at every nook and cranny etc. 

“The entire Hyderabad Airport family including all our stakeholders are working through the lockdown period to ensure that we have the right measures in place for ensuring passenger safety once the commercial flight operations are permitted to resume by the government. While the airport is geared up with a high level of hygiene and new operational procedures, passengers’ role in keeping the airport safe would also be equally important,” said SGK Kishore, CEO, GHIAL.
