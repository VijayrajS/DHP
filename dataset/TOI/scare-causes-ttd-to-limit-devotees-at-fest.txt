2020-03-14
In view of the rising number of cases of novel coronavirus in the country and as a precautionary measure, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is likely to restrict the audience for the Sri Ramanavami Utsavams slated to begin on April 4 at the Sri Kodanda Rama Swamy temple at Vontimitta in Kadapa district.

Addressing the media in Tirupati, TTD executive officer (EO) Anil Kumar Singhal said the Utsavam at Vontimitta is celebrated annually as a state festival and religious importance is attached to the Sitarama Kalyanam that is a part of the festival. 

 
 

“Like every year, we anticipate more than one lakh devotees to take part in the Sitarama Kalyanam scheduled for April 7 this year. TTD has already made elaborate arrangements for the conduct of the annual fete. As it is a customary practice, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy is also scheduled to present ‘pattu vastrams’ to the presiding deities. But owing to the central and state government’s coronavirus-related advisories to avoid large congregations, we have now consulted the AP state government for advice on whether to go ahead with the festival celebrations as planned,” said the EO.

The EO added, “We have brought the issue to the notice of the special chief secretary, medical and health department, government of Andhra Pradesh and sought the government’s advice. Once we get the instructions, there are chances of organising the religious events connected to the festival without having a large congregation.”

Meanwhile, the EO along with additional EO AV Dharma Reddy presented ‘pattu vastrams’ to the presiding deity of Bhaktavatsala Perumal at Tirunindravur in Tamil Nadu on Friday.
