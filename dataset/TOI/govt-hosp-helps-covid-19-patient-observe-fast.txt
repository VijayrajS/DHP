2020-04-27
Erode: The health authorities have made arrangements for a Covid-19 patient at Perundurai IRT Government Medical College Hospital to observe Ramzan fasting. 

Out of the four Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in the hospital, only one requested the authorities to make arrangements for prayers and fasting. “Since he was fit enough to fast, we gave permission and made necessary arrangements,’’ said hospital dean R Mani. He is being given traditional food early in the morning and dates and kanji in the evening to break the fast. 

The six Thailand nationals who tested positive for Covid-19 however did not make any request for special arrangements. Though the six have been recovered and tested negative, they are yet to be discharged. They are kept in a separate portion of the isolation ward in the hospital. Mani said all the six were aged and had several health complications. “It’s not medically advisable for them to undergo fasting. ’’ he said. tnn
