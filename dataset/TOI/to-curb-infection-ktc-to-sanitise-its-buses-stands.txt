Covid-19: To curb infection, KTC to sanitise its buses, stands
2020-03-13
PANAJI: The Union ministry of road transport and highways has issued a new advisory for public transport in India urging the authorities to take all requisite steps to sanitise seats, handles and bars in public transport vehicles. Taking the cue, the Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) will start sanitising its buses and bus stands from Saturday.


“We will sanitise bus stands once a day and buses will be done weekly after all passengers have left at the end of the day. A solution of Dettol and water will be sprayed,” KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate, said.

He also said interstate buses run by the KTC will be sanitised on priority. However, commuters from neighbouring states disembarking into the state’s bus terminuses are not being screened at this stage.

“There is a tendency of fear psychosis among passengers if bus staff wear masks. We have told conductors to wash their hands and clean the steering wheel each morning,” Ghate said. The transport directorate may soon issue orders for sanitisation of private buses, too.

“We would encourage people to carry their own sanitisers, wear face masks while commuting and, as much as possible, use their own transport till the situation improves,” a transport official told TOI.
