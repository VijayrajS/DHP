JAIPUR: Bhilwara, acknowledged worldwide for its ruthless containment model, reported five fresh Covid-19 positive cases on Tuesday.

The five cases were reported after a gap of 12 days. The last (28th) case was reported on April 9, when a teacher was found to be infected.

Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said on Tuesday that the “ambassador of Canada to India has suggested to their government to adopt the ruthless containment model of Bhilwara in their country”.

Of the new cases, two people had returned from Delhi on April 16, while two labourers (husband and wife) had been undergoing treatment at Bhilwara district hospital for cough and fever for the past five days. The fifth is the son of a compounder at Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, district hospital Bhilwara.

Health department officials said that two people — a 23-year-old man (a software engineer) and a 23-year-old woman who is a dress designer) had returned from Delhi in an SUV on April 16. When they reached Bhilwara, they were taken to an isolation facility. “We took their samples the same day and sent them for testing,” the official said.
