No inquest, no PM for Covid-19 deaths

Nagpur: As per orders of the state and central government, neither an inquest nor a post mortem will be conducted in Covid-19 death cases. 

On Monday, the state government issued a circular relieving the police of conducting an inquiry into cases of patients who may have died either due to confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. A few days back, the central government had asked forensic departments not to conduct an autopsy of patients “unless warranted by special circumstances of foul play”.

As a result, the body of the first patient to die of Covid-19 in Nagpur was handed over to the family without an inquest or post mortem on Monday.

The police had earlier approached the home department seeking exemption from performing the inquest panchnama of the suspects or confirmed patients in the backdrop of the high-risk pandemic disease.

The home department, citing special clauses mentioned under Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, and Disaster Management Act, 2005, stated the special exemption was extended to the cops in which there would be no “legal compulsion on them to perform the inquest”.

A senior police official said that the inquest is done with two witnesses, prior to the post mortem, to record the number of injuries on the body. “In Covid-19 related deaths, there is unlikely to be any external injuries which nullified the requirements of the inquest. In addition, cops are not trained to scientifically and technically protect themselves from the close contact of a person dying from a pandemic disease, making them highly susceptible to infection,” he said.

Doctors TOI spoke to said Covid-19 guidelines clearly stated that post mortem must be avoided. “Since cause of death is also clearly stated as due to coronavirus, it is not necessary,” a doctor at IGGMCH said.
