CHENNAI: Three religious preachers from Bangladesh, who carried out religious activities illegally in the city despite the lockdown, have been arrested at Periyamet, police said. Despite restrictions, they visited a few houses and conducted activities where people gathered in groups.

Police said Hussain Mohammed Amir, Saleem Hussain and Hussain Abdul reached the city on March 20 on a one-year tourist visa issued on February 17, police said. They were staying in the big mosque in Periyamet and had not informed or obtained permission to carry out the religious activities.
