Animals don’t transmit coronavirus, say experts
2020-04-17
Mysuru: Rumours on social media that animals can transmit coronavirus to humans led to many people abandoning their pets. Veterinarians and experts, however, have urged pet owners to disregard such misinformation. 

Karnataka Veterinary Association president Dr S C Suresh, who is also the assistant director of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, said pet owners need not panic. Dr Suresh said that Covid-19 and SARS are caused by the beta subfamily (type B) of coronavirus family, which is distinctly different from corona subfamily (alfa) that causes diseases in dogs, cats, pigs and cattle. “Therefore each type of coronavirus is host specific,” he said.

Association vice-president Veerabadraiah said that the WHO has stated that so far there has been no incidences of companion animals acting as either source of infection or spreading Covid-19 to humans. AIMS, the premier medical institute in India, too has informed that there is no evidence of such spread of infection. “We appeal pet owners not to panic. Pets and companion animals -- whether on the streets or in houses -- are very safe and must be looked after. It is also safe to have them around,” he said, asking people to support animal welfare volunteers who are feeding and taking care of needy animals during this hour of crisis.

Veerabadraiah also urged the pet owners to remain home confined and do not let their pets out. “Volunteers must take necessary precautions while on the field,” he said.

Animal lover P R Sunil said due to some mischievous elements, some pet owners abandoned their pets on the streets. “I have seen some dogs having neck belts roaming the streets in panic. It is very disappointing,” he said.

The closure of hotels and restaurants due to the lockdown has left stray animals, especially dogs, without food. Some animal welfare organisations have come to the rescue of strays.
