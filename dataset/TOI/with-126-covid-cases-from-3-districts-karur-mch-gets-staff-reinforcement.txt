Amid an increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases from four districts, Karur government medical college hospital has got staff reinforcements including an additional dean and 15 government doctors from neighbouring districts for effective administration. An additional deputy director of health services (DDHS) also has been appointed for Karur district. 

The MCH is among the 18 exclusive ‘Covid-19 hospitals’ designated across the state to treat positive cases. A total of 126 patients from Dindigul, Namakkal and from within Karur are being treated in isolation wards at the hospital.

Dean of Government MCH Perambalur Dr E Theranirajan has been appointed the additional dean and Dr Rajamohan deputy director of health services, Karur district. The 15 government doctors include two from Namakkal and five each from Pudukottai and Dindigul districts. All positives cases from Dindigul, Namakkal and Pudukottai districts will be shifted to Karur for effective treatment. 

Speaking to TOI, Karur medical college dean Dr Rosy Vennila said they are handling a large number of Covid-19 positive cases. “Further, ours is a new medical college and we do not have additional manpower unlike old medical college hospitals which will have postgraduate students,” she said. 

“Appointment of an additional dean will ease my burden in the administration so that we can focus more on the critical areas,” she said. 

It was on April 2 that 15 patients in the isolation ward of the medical college tested positive. All of them were attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat conference in New Delhi. The numbers have been consistently going up which stands at 25 from within the district alone.
