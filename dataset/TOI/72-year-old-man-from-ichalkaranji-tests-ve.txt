KOLHAPUR: A 72-year-old man from Ichalkaranji with no travel history tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. 

He was admitted to the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Rugnalaya (CPR), the civil hospital in Kolhapur, on Saturday with breathlessness and cold issues. According to the health department, the man did not come in contact with any positive patient identified earlier. 

A report from the CPR stated that the addition of the new case took the tally of positive cases in Kolhapur to 14, of which eight are active cases. 

District collector Daulat Desai said that considering the relief granted for few establishments across the district and the time at which the new positive case emerged, it became all the more important for citizens to follow social distancing norms and lockdown guidelines.

“Citizens should avoid unnecessary movement across the city. This kind of negligent behavior may complicate problems for the administration. If people fail to abide by the norms, the lockdown guidelines will be made more strict,” said Desai. 

Officials from the health department said that the second Covid-19 testing laboratory has started functioning at the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College campus. Thed laboratory had the capacity to test upto 300 throat swab samples per day. While one of the testing machine is automatic, the other one is manual and the testing time for each of the varies. 

Previously, the Kolhapur health department used to send the throat swab samples to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Later, the samples were sent to Miraj government hospital after a testing laboratory was set up there.
