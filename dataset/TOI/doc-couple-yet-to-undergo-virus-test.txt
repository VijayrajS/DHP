ALWAR: The doctor couple of the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Alwar who went abroad without informing the authorities and under home isolation was shifted to the isolation ward of the hospital on Thursday evening. However, they are yet to undergo test for coronavirus.


Similarly, the staff and patients who came in contact with the doctors during the duty in the hospital are also living in fear as the hospital administration has not started screening them.

The couple, an eye surgeon and his gynaecologist wife, work at the state-run Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Alwar and were on leave till March 2-12 for "urgent work" but went abroad without informing the authorities.

The couple returned from visiting countries including Singapore, and joined duty on March 12. They also performed operations putting the life of patients in danger of possible corona infection. One, an ophthalmologist performed eye cataract surgery whereas his wife, a gynaecologist had performed a caesarean delivery at the womenâ€™s hospital.

The CMHO had issued notice to the errant doctors describing their behaviour irresponsible.

CMHO Omprakash Meena said that the doctor couple is in home isolation since March 13 and directed to get them admitted in the corona ward.

The hospital administration came to know of the foreign jaunt of the doctors who were on leave only on alert from the Delhi airport.
