VISAKHAPATNAM: A training session on tackling coronavirus crisis was held at Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases in the city on Monday. The session was attended by a rapid response team comprising 16 doctors from four north coastal districts. 


Three nodal centres have been set up in the state (at government medical colleges at Guntur, Tirupati and Visakhapatnam) to train doctors. 

Each rapid response team consists of four doctors including a general physician, a community medicine expert, an epidemiologist and a microbiologist.

Andhra Medical College (AMC) in Visakhapatnam conducted the day-long training programme for Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts.

Dr P V Sudhakar, principal, AMC, said: “The training deals with tackling COVID 19 including home surveillance, in-patient treatment for every category, collecting and sending samples for testing and so on.”

Currently, samples are collected from suspected patients at the virology lab at AMC-King George Hospital and are sent to Gandhi Medical College in Hyderabad for Elisa and PCR tests. For further evaluation and viral culture, samples are sent to Pune virology lab, if required. So far, AP has not reported any confirmed coronavirus cases.
