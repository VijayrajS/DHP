Fighting coronavirus at grassroots: All village panchayats in Uttar Pradesh put on alert
2020-03-17
BIJNOR: After cities, Uttar Pradesh has decided to take its battle against coronavirus into its villages. Over 59,000 village panchayats have been put on alert and told to take a host of measures to check spread of the contagious disease which is increasingly making its presence felt in the country.


The precautionary measures include putting soaps at all the hand pumps and distributing pamphlets informing people about the dos and don’ts.

“All village heads, village secretaries and health workers have been asked to spread awareness about coronavirus. They should warn villagers against hiding any symptom, as it may prove fatal.

“Pamphlets are also being put up on the walls informing people about the disease. Apart from this, village heads have been directed to keep soaps at all the hand pumps,” said Bijnor’s district panchayat raj officer (DPRO) Satish Kumar.

He added, “There are over 59,000 village panchayats in the state, and advisories have been issued to all of them. Village heads and health workers are also sensitizing the villagers. They are urging them to wash hands with soap and water or to use alcohol-based hand wash, maintain distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up virus. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to eyes, nose or mouth. From their virus can enter human body and make them sick.” DPRO Kumar said, “We are urging the villagers that if they have fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, they should seek doctor’s help and keep themselves isolated from their family.”

When contacted, district malaria officer Brijbhushan said, “Awareness is necessary in rural areas also, as thousands of people work abroad and they are returning their homes. In Bijnor district, we had a list containing names of 40 people who have come from foreign countries. Out of them, we have traced 38 and they are doing fine. But two are untraceable. Their addresses were wrong.

“Health department has set up an isolation ward with 20 beds in district hospital, and a separate ward at woman hospital with four beds. Besides, ten beds in each community hospital have been reserved. Five ambulances have also been reserved.”
