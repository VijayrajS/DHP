2020-05-15
LUCKNOW: Three members of a Gomtinagar family, including an elderly couple, were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, three days after returning from Aligarh.

The alley of their house in Viram Khand was sealed by administration and movement of residents restricted to contain the spread of virus.

Another case, the fourth on Thursday, was detected when a 20-year-old man from Sadar tested positive and was admitted to RSM hospital, pushing total cases in the city to 281.

District infectious disease unit in-charge Dr K P Tripathi said the family had gone to Aligarh on May 9 to attend funeral of a relative.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Narendra Agrawal said, “The family of an elderly couple and their son returned on May 11. We received alert from Aligarh administration on May 12 that the family had come in contact with an infected person who died following which swab samples of the three were collected. Their reports came positive. The two elderlies have been admitted to KGMU and son to RSM hospital. Samples of their neighbours are being collected.” 

The CMO feigned ignorance when asked whether the family had taken permission for travel saying police and district administration should have stopped them at borders if they had no pass. Calls and messages in this regard to district magistrate Abhishek Prakash went unanswered.

The 29-year-old son of the couple, however, told TOI over phone that he is admitted in KGMU and not RSM hospital.

“We went to Aligarh on April 27 to see my ailing grandmother after taking due permission from administration. She died on April 28 and was not a Covid-19 patient. We came back on May 11,” he said. 

“My uncle (father’s elder brother) died in Aligarh on May 12 and he was diagnosed with Covid-19,” he added.
