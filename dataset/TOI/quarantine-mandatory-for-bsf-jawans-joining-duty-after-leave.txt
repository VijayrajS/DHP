JAISALMER: Those jawans and officers of the paramilitary forces, including BSF, who went on leave prior to the start of lockdown, will now have to stay in quarantine on returning to their place of deployment.


Directions have been issued in this regard by the BSF DG and strict action will be taken against those not following it. Senior officers have started making plans for the officers and jawans returning to duty from leave. Process has been initiated for creating quarantine centres at hospitals, battalion headquarters and sector headquarters.

The district administration has been asked to provide government schools or government buildings for quarantine centres.

After the directions were issued, a large number of officers caught in lockdown reached their deployment spots on Wednesday evening. They will now remain under 14-day quarantine.

BSF DG S S Deswal on Wednesday issued strict warning stating that violator of the new norms will have to face strict disciplinary action.
