MUMBAI: In a first, Bandra (W) will get a two-storey quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients. BMC officials on Friday cleaned the facility, where operations may begin shortly, in coordination with Lilavati Hospital, which shares a common wall. Civic officials said at a meeting with municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on March 18, a decision was taken to have a quarantine facility in Bandra.


Assistant municipal commissioner (H west ward) Vinayak Vispute said, “Under accommodation reservations, BMC acquired the vacant nursing home.”

Lilavati agreed to help BMC with medical facilities, while house-keeping and other facilities will be provided by BMC. Vispute said while the maternity home was designed for 100 beds, around 30 will be made available there.
