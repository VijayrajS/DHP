2020-06-03
Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Tuesday declared three more persons dead. But much like details of positive cases, the details of the deceased have also been withheld by the civic body in its medical bulletin.

With the deaths of three more being confirmed by the VMC, the death toll in the city went up to 45. Sources, however, said that the actual death toll is much higher. VMC has been delaying confirmation of deaths on grounds that it is yet to receive death audit reports in several cases.

While the death toll of persons who tested positive for Covid-19 may stand at 45, Covid-19 is believed to be the primary cause of death only in seven cases. Thirty-seven are said to have succumbed due to co-morbidities and one person is believed to have died as he was suffering from dengue too. Since Monday evening 32 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported. With these, the total number of positive cases in city and district went up to 1,118. The fresh cases include one from Khatamba village the district and one person from Surat. The east zone of the city saw the highest number of fresh cases as 16 tested positive from this part of the VMCâ€™s jurisdiction. Eight tested positive from the south zone and six from the north even as no cases were reported in the west zone.
