2020-04-19
PATNA: The Siwan district authorities heaved a sigh of relief after the medical reports of 12 of the 29 people earlier tested positive for coronavirus came negative on Saturday.

The test reports came a day after a five-member rapid response team from the Centre visited Siwan, one of hotspots for Covid19 pandemic in the state. “A five-member team from the National Centre for Disease Control visited the isolation centres in the district and enquired about the facilities being provided to the patients. The members of the team also talked to some patients,” newly appointed civil surgeon Dr Yadvendu Kumar Sharma said.

Sharma added tele-consultancy facility would be started in the district soon on the directive of the state health department. The requisite training to the personnel for the facility is being imparted, he said.

Meanwhile, Siwan DM Amit Kumar Pandey said door-to-door screening was being carried out in the district. “No fresh case has been reported from the district in the last couple of days, which is a good sign. Lockdown is being enforced strictly,” he added.

The DM said the containment zones in the district have been sealed and strict vigil is maintained. “No laxity on the part of the enforcing agencies will be tolerated,” the DM said, adding drone cameras were being used to watch the activities in the earmarked villages.

Meanwhile, no fresh positive case of corona has been reported from neighbouring Gopalganj district, which had earlier reported three positive cases.
