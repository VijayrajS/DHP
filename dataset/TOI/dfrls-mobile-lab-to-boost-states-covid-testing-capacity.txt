DFRL’s mobile lab to boost state’s covid testing capacity
2020-05-13
Mysuru: Karnataka’s Covid testing capacity is likely to go up with Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) knocking on the doors of Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL), an arm of Defence Research and Development Organisation, seeking its help.

Mysuru-based DFRL has advanced testing facility. If the facility is inducted into Covid lab, it could increase testing of samples by 300 a day.

The Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute is currently conducting around 300 test a day. Since two week average daily covid testing capacity has increased to 4800. Increasing capacity of Mysuru lab could push up the figure beyond 5000 mark every day.

CP Nanjaraj, dean and director of MMC&RI, said that talks are underway with DFRL to utilise the mobile lab facility to carryout Covid tests in Mysuru. “This will surely enhance our testing capacity beyond 600 every day,” he said.
