2020-04-14
AHMEDABAD: If you allow your children to outside to play during this Covid-19 lockdown, you could face legal action. This happened in the Ghatlodia area of city, where cops booked six parents on Saturday, after their children were found playing in the common plot.


Senior police officials said that such action will be taken against parents who do not keep their children indoors. 

The six Ghatlodia residents were booked after their children, four boys and two girls between 10 and 17, were found playing together in the common plot of their housing society. According to the FIR filed by head constable Dipaksinh Sardar, the cops had on Friday evening flown a drone over the area to check whether the lockdown rules were being followed.

When the drone flew over Ami and Asopalav Apartments in Ghatlodia, police saw the children playing. Their pictures were taken and the cops later identified and summoned their parents. On not getting a satisfactory explanation, the cops booked six parents for violating the notification of the police commissioner and under the Epidemic Diseases Act.

An official of city police said the action is on the lines of traffic offences where parents are booked for offences by children. 

“We first cautioned parents telling them not to allow their children to go out in the open as they could catch the virus. As no one heeded our advice and the and the children were seen playing in the same area, we booked the parents to set an example. This will continue in other areas of the city as well,” said an official.

Police have also been monitoring cctv footage to identify such children. tnn
