CHANDERNAGORE: A teacher at a private school in Hooghly’s Serampore was arrested on Tuesday over her Facebook post on the emergency medical officer of Howrah General Hospital, who tested positive for Covid -19 on Sunday. 

The woman was picked up from her home at Hooghly’s Konnagar on Tuesday by cops from Uttarpara police station. She was produced in Serampore court on charges under the Disaster Management Act.

The action follows a letter to state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on behalf of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF) against the post. In its letter signed by senior members of the forum, WBDF wrote, “In violation of the law, she has not only defamed him (the doctor).... but created a scope of hazard to his family members as well.” Referring to the doctor, the WBDF letter stated the doctor is a government officer who contracted “an illness” in the line of duty for no fault of his. “This is extremely unfortunate to see such outrage and instigation from such people. Such actions if not dealt with strictly will instigate others to do the same,” the letter stated.

The chief secretary replied, “The woman has been arrested. Police found another person of the same housing complex who had uploaded a video. He was not arrested because he is in home quarantine. He will be arrested after he comes out of it.” The man in home isolation uploaded a video against the doctor, who lives in another housing complex nearby. The doctor has been admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, while his family members have been kept in isolation. 

Chandernagore police commissioner Humayun Kabir said, “Such a post on a doctor who is risking his life is condemnable and illegal. The woman has been sent to judicial custody till April 17.” The woman said, “I will seek pardon. It was a mistake.” Konnagar civic chairman Bappaditya Chatterjee said, “We want action against the accused.”
