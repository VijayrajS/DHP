PANAJI: One more Covid-19 suspect, who worked on a ship and travelled to Goa on Thursday, was placed in isolation ward no. 113 of Goa Medical College, taking the total number of suspects in isolation to three. 

The suspect worked on a ship that travelled to Europe, including Italy, which has been under lock-down due to Covid-19 since midlast month. 

Dr Jose D’Sa, director of public health department (PHD), said the suspect was directly brought to GMC from the airport as he was found symptomatic for the disease.

 D’Sa ruled out a possibility that he (suspect) may have exposed his family and others, who had been in contact with him to the virus in the event he tests positive for coronavirus. 

On Wednesday, two suspects — a male and a female — with travel history were quarantined at the GMC.

Laboratory reports of all three suspects are awaited, GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar told TOI. The condition of all three patients“is stable”, Bandekar said. 

With three more persons put under home quarantine on Thursday, the number of people who have been quarantined at home rose to 36.
