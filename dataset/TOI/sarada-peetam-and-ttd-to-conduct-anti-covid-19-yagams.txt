Hyderabad: Several religious organisations are taking up homams and yagams to fight Covid-19. Sarada Peetham and TTD have decided to conduct ‘Visha jwara peeda hara yagam (anti-viral fever yagam) and health homam.

 Swathamanandendra Saraswathi, the utharadhikari of Visakha Sri Sarada Peetham, said, “Coronavirus has affected not only the country but the world. We are conducting Visha Jwara Peeda Hara Yagam. Currently, the planetary situation of the country is going through a bad phase. Three grahas and two bad grahas have come together and, as per astrology, it is not good. From March 23, the situation will become worse. The country will face Kala Sarpa Dosha between April 2 and May 10,” Swathamananendra Saraswati said, adding the yagam would help to keep people hale and healthy.

“The yagam, which began on Wednesday, will continue for 11 days without break. We are using medicinal herbs, scents and cow dung . The homam’s residue will help everyone be healthy,” he added. 

Meanwhile, TTD has started performing Veda Parayanam and Yagam for the health of all citizens. The 10-day Sri Srinivasa Veda Mantra Arogya Japa Yagnam , which started on March 16, will conclude on March 25. Vedic exponents from all four southern states were participating in it. TTD is also organising Sri Srinivasa Shantyotsava Sahita Dhanvantari Maha Yagam between March 26 and 28 for the universal well being.
