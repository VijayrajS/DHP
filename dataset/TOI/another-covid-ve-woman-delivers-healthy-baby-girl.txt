AURANGABAD: A Covid-19 positive woman delivered a healthy baby at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) around midnight on Saturday. GMCH dean Kanan Yelikar confirmed on Sunday that a 28-year-old woman from Baijipura-Indiranagar area had given birth to a healthy baby girl.


According to Shrinivas Gadappa, the GMCH head of the department of gynaecology and obstetrics (OBGYN), in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, all pregnant women coming for delivery from the containment zones are being treated as positive cases. “The women from high-risk areas are tested for Covid-19. Until their report is received, they are treated as positive patients and all necessary precautions are taken,” Gadappa said.

In this case, proactive questioning and timely action by the OBGYN department ensured safe delivery and prevented the spread of infection to other patients and hospital staff.

The woman was admitted to the GMCH on Saturday afternoon and she gave normal birth to a girl at 12.30 am on Sunday. The baby weighs 2.8 kg and is healthy, Gadappa added.

When asked about the possibility of transmission of infection from mother to child, Gadappa said there have been zero incidents anywhere in the world of vertical transmission of Covid-19 infection ie. transmission of the infection from mother to baby through the blood. “However, the baby cannot be brought close to the mother. We have shifted the mother to Covid-19 isolation ward and the baby is being fed express milk pumped from the mother,” he said. She will be able to hold the baby only after she tests negative for coronavirus, Gadappa said.

This is the second delivery by a Covid-19 positive woman in Aurangabad. The first delivery was conducted by doctors at the district civil hospital through C-section. That woman had recovered and was discharged along with her newborn earlier this week.
