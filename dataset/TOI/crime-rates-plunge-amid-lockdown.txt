Crime rates plunge amid lockdown
2020-04-10
Coimbatore: Crime rates are going down across the city, thanks to the Covid-19 lockdown.

While 14 vehicle thefts, two house break-ins, three robberies, two fatal accidents and three chain snatching cases were reported between March 24 and April 7 last year, no such offences were reported during the period this year, police said. “We curtailed people’s movement drastically during the lockdown that began at 6pm on March 24. People are staying at home and cops are present round-the-clock in the city,” police commissioner Sumit Sharan said.

However, a house break-in was reported during the period.

As many as 1,800 police personnel are deployed in the city in three shifts. The cops are booking cases against those who deliberately come out and violate the prohibitory order.

Though no murder cases were reported from the city, one was reported from rural Coimbatore.
