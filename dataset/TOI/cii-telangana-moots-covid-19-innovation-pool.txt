Hyderabad: Urging innovators to use IPR judiciously in the time of Covid-19 crisis, apex trade and industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday proposed setting up of ‘COVID Innovation and IP Pool’ to accelerate the pace of innovation as well its adoption.

As per CII, there has been a surge in the number of applicants filing trademarks for ‘Coronavirus’ and ‘COVID’ related marks and many firms might be unaware of the fact that they may end up stepping into other’s IP and brands which may result in legal battle with brand owners later.

“For universities it is time to file IPs on Covid-19 related research and get their due recognition as after the crisis there might be instances of multiple innovators claiming rights on the same innovation,” CII said.
