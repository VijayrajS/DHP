JAIPUR: Pink City beats all other districts in the state in terms of being the worst-affected due to Covid-19 pandemic with highest number of deaths per million population (ppm).

At 15 deaths per million, Jaipur tops the list with Kota and Jodhpur close behind. Even the case fatality rate (CFR) for the city, which is nearing 5, is highest among the seven worst-affected districts of the state.





However, nationally, Jaipur fares better and is not among the top five worst-affected cities. With 118 deaths per million, Ahmedabad tops the chart, followed by Mumbai with 83 and Pune with 55 deaths per million. Delhi figures at rank 4 with 32 deaths while Kolkata stands at fifth position with 23 deaths per million.

“We have launched mission Life Saving in the state to identify vulnerable groups for early diagnosis and early treatment to prevent deaths due to Covid-19. It has played a big role in keeping the mortality rate under control,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health).

When it comes to the case fatality rate, deaths per 100 cases, Jaipur lead the pack with 4.7% average rate, while with Kota coming a close second at 3.5%, and Ajmer at 2.5%. However, with Jodhpur at 1.1% CFR, the district has managed fairly well in preventing deaths. This is when the number of positive cases reported from Jodhpur stands at 1,762, which is just after Jaipur with 2,188 cases, the highest in the state.

The seven districts that have contributed 78% of total deaths in the state are Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Ajmer, Nagaur, Pali and Bharatpur.

In all these districts, the cases were reported in clusters in certain areas and the health department had to impose curfew to contain the spread of the virus.
