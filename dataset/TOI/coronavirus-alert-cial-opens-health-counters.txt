KOCHI: As part of the precautionary measures in the wake of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) disease outbreak, the Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) has opened special health counters to check passengers at its immigration desk. Passengers coming from Far East and Southeast Asia will be screened at these counters for fever or any other ailments, which are considered symptoms of the disease. The move was after instructionsfrom the ministries of civil aviation and health affairs to mandatorily implement preventive measures following high alert around the world.


Passengers coming from suspected areas, mainly China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, are being briefed about the health issues and the precautionary measures to be followed. There are no direct flights from China to Kochi and those passengers from China would have to come via Southeast Asian nations or Sri Lanka. Hence, passengers travelling in those flights from these countries are also monitored. There are around eight flights from these countries to Kochi daily.

“Special health counters with doctors and paramedical staff have started operating near the immigration desk throughout the airport working hours. Passengers are asked to fill up a form seeking health details. Also, an isolation ward has been set up at the Government Medical College, Ernakulam. So far, 28 passengers (coming indirectly from affected areas) have undergone screening tests. All tests were negative,” said an airport official.

The passengers’ passports are being checked to know whether they have been to any of the affected areas recently. Special masks and gloves were distributed to officials deployed in the international arrival area. Special transportation arrangements, including a sterilized ambulance, were made ready to transport suspected passengers to the medical college isolation ward,” an official said.
