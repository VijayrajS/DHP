Jodhpur: Pali has emerged as a new epicentre of coronavirus infection in Jodhpur division with staggering 59 cases reported in just 10 days.

 A green zone district earlier, nearly 80% of Pali’s city area is under curfew now. Of the 59 cases, Pali alone accounts for 53 cases and two others had been reported from rural areas.

According to an official, the administration had started planning for relaxation in lockdown conditions in Pali with the lockdown 2.0 coming to an end on May 3 with special focus on industries.

“But everything changed on April 27 when a woman from Nadi Mohalla was tested positive and when her contact tracing was done, positive cases started pouring in one after another,” said district magistrate Ansh Deep. 

Interestingly, till April 27, Pali had reported only two positive cases and those too from rural areas, which had even recovered before the first positive case was reported from Pali city.

According to the sources, failure of the administration in keeping an eye on the woman led to spurt in the positive cases in Pali.

“She had come from Kolkata on April 18 and had been quarantined at home. But she did not adhere to the protocol and kept meeting others. She even tore off the notice pasted outside her house,” said a source.

Ansh Deep said that out of 65 city wards, 50 are under complete curfew, which constitutes 80% of the total area of Pali. Four areas of Pali have been declared red zone that comprise all the curfew-bound wards.

“Most of these cases have been reported from Nadi Mohalla. We are trying to collect samples of the entire area as soon as possible,” said Ansh Deep.

So far, 1,180 samples have been collected by the medical teams from the entire district and 250 samples are being tested in Pali itself, which, however, also include samples from Jalore.
