2020-04-27
NEW DELHI: To prevent people from stepping out to shop during the holy month of Ramzan, police will patrol the streets in specially-designed cars with public address systems and conduct flag marches inside the colonies in central, northeast and southeast Delhi.

The cops have also asked local mosques to use their public address systems to urge people to stick to the lockdown rules. The imams of Jama Masjid and the Fatehpuri mosque have been requested to advise people to stay inside and pray.

In central Delhi, a flag march was conducted in areas around Hauz Qazi after a group of people stepped out to shop for Ramzan goods on Friday. In south Delhi, a van has been modified with stickers all over it informing the public about the rules. 

Drones will also be used to monitor the roads around the mosques after the iftar in all these areas and the terraces and the congested markets in Old Delhi where people usually gather to break the fast or offer prayers.

The residents outside containment zones can step out during the iftar for a stipulated period and collect food from police vehicles or permitted shops. To distribute food in containment zones, police will take help of NGOs. 

On Sunday, 83 FIRs were registered for violation of the lockdown rules under IPC 188 and 2,422 people were detained. Police booked 35 people for stepping out without a mask.
