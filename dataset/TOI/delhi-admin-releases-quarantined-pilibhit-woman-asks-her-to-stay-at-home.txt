PILIBHIT: A Pilibhit woman, who was quarantined at Terapanh Bhawanat in South Delhi’s Chhatarpur area upon her return from abroad on March 19, has been released by the Delhi administration after her quarantine period expired on April 5.

However, the woman — was sent to Pilibhit on a transit pass — has been directed to quarantine herself at her house for 14 days.

A copy of her transit permit was sent to Pilibhit superintendent of police Abhishek Dixit.

According to Dixit, the woman has not reached Pilibhit till Tuesday evening, but the information of her release from the Delhi-based quarantine centre has been shared with the health department.

The woman would be monitored during her home-quarantine here, said Dixit.

The SP, meanwhile, said a joint team of police and health department raided as many as 80 residential premises in different localities under Pilibhit kotwali on Tuesday in search of people who had attended the Nizamuddin congregation in Delhi or those who came in contact with an attendee of the meet.

During the search operation, police did not find any such person living in kotwali area, but the operation would continue till the time the central government kept sending lists of such persons, added the SP.
