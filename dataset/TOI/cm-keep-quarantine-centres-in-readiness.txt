2020-05-15
PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Thursday asked the officials concerned to keep the panchayat level quarantine centres for migrant workers and other facilities for those returning from abroad in utmost readiness.

The CM said the number of migrant workers coming from other states would be large, and all required facilities should be in place at the panchayat level quarantine centres in close coordination with panchayat representatives. Similarly, facilities should also be made at the quarantine centres where foreign returnees will be lodged, he said.

The CM asked the officials concerned to take note of the zones/states/regions from where the migrant workers are coming. Accordingly, the arrangements, including with regard to conducting their corona testing, should be kept in place at the quarantine centres, he said.

Nitish directed the officials to create testing facilities in all the districts expeditiously so that the testing for corona could be maximized as this alone would help in combating the corona pandemic.

The CM said the Shramik special trains would be bringing back the migrant workers, but buses and smaller vehicles should also be used to bring the willing migrant workers from the neighbouring states.

Anticipating the rush of the migrant workers and those coming from abroad, the CM advised the officials to remain alert.
