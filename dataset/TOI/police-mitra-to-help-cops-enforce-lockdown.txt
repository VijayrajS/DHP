‘Police Mitra’ to help cops enforce lockdown
2020-04-15
Rajkot: In order to unburden the overworked police force, the Rajkot police has decided to seek help of concerned citizens. The police are in need of a helping hand after the lockdown period got extended to May 3 on Tuesday. Cops have been performing their duty tirelessly ever since the lockdown was enforced on March 23. 

“We have decided to form a unit of citizens under the name ‘Police Mitra.’ Each police station will have a unit consisting of 15 to 20 people. ‘Police Mitra’ will be deployed along with the cops,” said Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agrawal in a press conference held on Tuesday. 

“Police Mitra members will also help the common people get essential commodities and medicines delivered at their doorsteps,” said Agrawal. 

“We have made wearing masks for all people on the road mandatory. A strict action will be taken against those caught on the street without passes,” Agrawal added.
