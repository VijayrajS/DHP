2020-02-12
Mangaluru: A Mangaluru youth working in a Chinese ship has arrived in India after a week-long ordeal due to the coronavirus scare.

Gaurav Bangera of Kumpala near Thokkotu was forced to postpone his wedding which was scheduled to be held on February 10, as he was not allowed to go on holiday from the ship World Dream Cruise, in which he was working. 

The cruise vessel was anchored at Hong Kong and was not allowed to sail due to the coronavirus threat. 

Was quarantined

Gaurav was supposed to land in Mangaluru on February 7. However, when the vessel was quarantined in Hong Kong, his wedding was postponed. 

On Monday, Gaurav arrived in Mumbai, and is expected to reach his home in Kumpala, late in the night on Tuesday.

Tests negative

Gaurav’s relative Ganesh Gatty told TOI that the ship was allowed to sail since all tests conducted on passengers and crew proved negative for coronavirus.

“They had conducted tests on all passengers and crew several times. Initially, the ship was not allowed to sail due to official procedures in that country. We had booked a hall in the city for his wedding, and invited all our relatives too. Similarly, all other arrangements too were made for the wedding. Later, we decided to postpone the wedding, since he was stranded in the ship at Hong Kong,” said Ganesh. 

New date for wedding to be fixed

“He has reached Mumbai and we are expecting his arrival today. We will fix the next date for his wedding, after discussing with him and all relatives,” Gatty said.

There were nearly 1,600 people, including passengers and crew on the cruise vessel, which set sail from China on January 26, and it was scheduled to reach Taiwan on February 5.
