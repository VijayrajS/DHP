Lockdown disrupts debit card delivery
2020-04-23
Mumbai: Banks are finding it a challenge to replace the millions of debit and credit cards that expire this month. The lockdown has thrown up logistical challenges although the government has allowed courier companies to function in this period. 

There are 81 crore debit cards, most of which have a five-year validity and around 5.6 crore credit cards that have a shorter validity. “On an average 40-50 lakh cards come up for renewal every month. While banks typically begin the replacement process a month in advance, the current lockdown has now exceeded a month and many cards are stuck in the pipeline,” said an executive with a private bank.

Bankers said that while the Centre has announced relaxations for businesses like courier services from April 20, the situation on the ground is different across cities. In many places, there are restrictions on the areas that the courier services can reach as they are not categorised as an essential service. Many private banks have integrated their systems with courier services like Blue Dart to ensure there is proper tracking and identification of the card. SBI is using India Post for card delivery but some banks say they do not have proper agreements with the department to ensure no card is lost. 

While some branches do offer ‘insta debit card’ branches that are equipped with these machines are few and far between. Debit cards are turning out to be crucial for not just cash withdrawal but also for regenerating forgotten netbanking passwords. A large number of accountholders also use their debit cards for online payments. “While banking has been classified as an essential service, this aspect of physical delivery of cards also needs to be classified as essential,” said a bank executive. A few lenders like SBI, allow their accountholders ‘cardless’ withdrawal from ATMs through their banking app.
