Rajasthan: Congress MLA bats for liquor shops, says booze can kill virus
2020-05-01
KOTA: Sangod Congress MLA Bharat Singh Kundanpur on Thursday shot a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot expressing concern on rise in manufacturing and sale of illegal countrymade liquor and urged him to grant permission to open liquor shops in the state.

In the letter, the MLA said closure of liquor shops had broken the backbone of state’s economy and it had led to the sale and manufacture of illegal countrymade liquor.

“When alcohol can remove Covid-19 virus with handwash, it is sure to remove the virus from a booze guzzler’s throat,” Singh argued and demanded the state government to grant permission to open liquor shops.

 
 

Since the demand for liquor amid lockdown is higher in the markets, as booze lovers welcome it, the illegal manufacturing and sale of country made liquor is not only causing heavy loss to state’s revenue, but also harm to booze guzzlers’ health, he added.

The MLA also referred to the incident of Halena village in Bharatpur where two persons lost their eyesight and died after consuming country made liquor and to the state government’s decision to increase excise duty on liquor in order to make up for the revenue loss during lockdown.

The target of generating revenue of Rs 12,500 crore from sale of liquor in the year 2020-2021 seems impossible due to the lockdown, he said, and recommended it is better to allow opening liquor shops so that the state government can generate revenue.

Notably, another MLA from Bhadara area of Hanumangarh district Balwan Singh Punia, wrote a letter to Gehlot urging him to grant permission to open liquor shops in the state amid lockdown.
