Coronavirus: Demand for N95 masks rises
2020-02-04
AHMEDABAD: The scare for coronavirus infections has pushed up the demand for N95 masks, especially among non-resident Indians (NRIs) and travellers who are going abroad. Estimates by chemists suggest that the stock of masks has eroded with high demand from travellers and currently, only pollution masks are available in the market.

“The demand for N95 masks has shown a sharp rise in the city, especially from NRIs, foreigners and those travelling abroad. N95 masks are more in demand because they provide protection against the viruses. We are already out of stock and have placed order for the new stock, but it will take at least a week to be delivered,” said Dashrat Patel, owner of a city-based medical store.

 
 “Some people also buy pollution masks, but they don’t provide protection against viruses,” he added.

Chemists said that the shelf-life of the N95 mask is about six hours and each family that is travelling procures a significant stock from the market. Industry sources also revealed that several of these masks are being sold in black market as well. “Masks that cost Rs 110 per mask are procured in bulk and are sold at more than double the price at Rs 250. Currently there is a major shortage in the market, even with wholesalers,” said a source.

“Use of N95 masks – protecting inhalation of very small airborne particles – is advisable both for the persons having any signs and for protection. For the infected person, it prevents spread of the virus whereas for the persons close by, it prevents accidental exposure,” said city-based critical care specialist Dr Manoj Singh.
