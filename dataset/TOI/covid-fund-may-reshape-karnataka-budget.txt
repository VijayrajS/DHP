2020-05-13
BENGALURU: The numbers of the state’s budget for 2020-21 are expected to undergo major revision as the BS Yediyurappa government must set aside a significant chunk of funds to fight coronavirus.


Chief minister BS Yediyurappa held a meeting with officials of the finance department on Tuesday to explore ways to mobilise resources to fund Covid-19 response. He is likely to readjust allocations proposed in the 2020-21 budget soon, an official said.

According to an estimate, the state government needs at least Rs 10,000 crore to fund direct and indirect operations related to Covid-19. Direct operations involve creating medical facilities, including testing labs, whereas indirect operations entail welfare measures such as the Rs 1,610-crore financial package for the unorganised sectors. 

While there is no budgetary allocation for the Covid-19 battle as such, Yediyurappa wants a dedicated fund to carry out relief measures and medical response, and he has asked officials to prepare a plan to achieve this.

“The meeting mainly discussed the mode implementation of the Rs 1,610 crore package. The chief minister also directed officials to put in place an effective system to identify the beneficiaries of the package and ensure the benefit reaches them,” an official said.
