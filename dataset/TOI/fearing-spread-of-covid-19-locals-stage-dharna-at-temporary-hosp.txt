Bareilly: Fearing spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) in their neighbourhood, local residents of Chandausi in UP’s Sambhal district staged a dharna outside a temporary hospital facility set up at railway training institute to treat suspected cases.

Sources said that angry residents gathered outside the medical facility and staged dharna on Thursday, opposing the move and said that “they would not let Covid-19 patients stay in the area”.

According to the police, around 180 Indian nationals living abroad and suspected with Covid-19-like symptoms will be put up at the institute. Opposing the move, locals stated that adequate medical facilities and treatment were not available to fight a deadly virus like Covid-19 in their district. Therefore, keeping infected people here will be, according to them, “a high risk” for all residents.

SDM Mahesh Dixit, Kotwali police and Bahjoi police reached the spot to take stock of the situation. SHO Chandausi, Dharam Pal Singh told TOI, “People came here in panic and started assembling outside the hospital facility in the afternoon. They demanded the authorities to roll back the decision of treating Covid-19 cases. The situation was brought under control and no major incident took place. People are peacefully staging protest against the decision. No complaint has been registered so far.”

Chief medical officer (CMO) Sambhal Dr Amita Singh said, “The move has been taken up on the directions issued by the Centre and will be worked upon accordingly. Moreover, there is a lot of panic among people due to the virus outbreak and people need to be made aware of it in detail. The local administration has taken cognizance and the issue will be resolved at the earliest.”
