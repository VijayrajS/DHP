Prayagraj: Eight novel coronavirus patients from Prayagraj region would be discharged and allowed to go home after they tested negative for the infection for the third time on Friday.

A Covid-19 positive patient is released from isolation if he/she tests negative for the virus for the third consecutive time. The eight patients had been undergoing treatment at Coivd-19 Level One Hospital in Kotwa.

Among the released patients, six are from Pratapgarh, one from Kaushambi and one Indonesain national who was staying in Prayagraj.

Till now, nine novel coronavirus cases have been reported from the three districts of Prayagraj region — six from Pratapgrah, two from Kaushambi and one from Prayagraj. The patients diagnosed in from Pratapgrah and Prayagraj had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi in March, which has been linked to several cases across the country.

In Prayagraj, an Indonesian national who had returned to the city after attending the congregation had tested positive for the Covid-19 last week. However, district officials are yet to confirm where the international citizen would be taken as his passport has already been seized. A lookout notice was issued against him earlier this week, prohibiting him from leaving the country.

Nodal official and additional chief medical officer Dr Rishi Sahai said, “Currently, nine novel coronavirus patients are undergoing treatment at Covid-19 Level One Hospital in Kotwa and eight of them would be released.”

Sahai said that a third sample of the Kaushambi-based man, who tested positive for the virus in the second test too, will be collected on Sunday.
