Vijayawada: After a lull for a day, 12 new positive coronavirus (Covid-19) cases were reported in the city, taking the total number to 258. 

The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and health department officials had felt relief when no cases were reported on Friday, but the sudden spike in numbers has worried them. 

Krishna Lanka again stood on top with six cases — one each in Balaji Nagar, Nunna, Kothapeta, and three cases from Gunadala. 

Krishna district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz has directed the officials to focus on containment measures in Karmika Nagar, Krishna Lanka, Ajith Singh Nagar, Vidhyadharapuram, and Kudhus Nagar. He also reviewed the geographical quarantine method implemented in high-risk areas in the city. 

“We have completely restricted the movement of vehicles and people in red zones as a part of our geographical quarantine method. We have also noticed that most cases were from Krishna Lanka, Machavaram, and other densely populated areas. People there ignored social distancing and it has resulted in the rapid spread of Covid-19. One person become a super-carrier and transmitted the virus to around 40 persons in his neighbourhood,” Imtiaz said. 

“We are happy that the number of cases has reduced thanks to the efforts by the officials. We are confident that the number of cases will come down further and red zones will be converted into orange zones soon,” he added. 

Meanwhile, Krishna district officials announced that they have conducted around 12,000 tests in the district till Saturday in which 8,000 of them were done using rapid test kits. 

As many as 10,289 patients have tested negative so far and reports of around 1,566 patients are pending.
