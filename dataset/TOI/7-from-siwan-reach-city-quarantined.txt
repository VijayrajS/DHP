PATNA: Seven persons from Siwan were picked up by police from East Indira Nagar under Kanakarbagh police station in Patna and quarantined at College of Commerce centre. They were picked up on complaints lodged by local residents about the outsiders on Thursday.

It was not clear how they managed to reach Patna as Siwan borders have been sealed after the maximum 29 Covid cases were reported from the district. Sources said the family of seven persons reached here on Wednesday night and stayed at the residence of their relatives. But alert neighbours informed the police next day.

Kankarbagh police station SHO Manoranjan Bharti said, “A district control room team took them to the college quarantine centre after proper medical screening.”

When contacted, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said it was being inquired as how they reached Patna from Siwan and if they were issued passes for movement.

Hours before the Kankarbagh incident, police raided a house at Indrapuri under Patliputra police station on Thursday on information from the residents about two outsiders staying there. Patliputra SHO SK Shahi said, “A man and his pregnant wife had taken shelter at his friend’s house due to financial issues and lack of food. The couple was from Ramkrishna Nagar police station area in Patna. We got the couple’s antecedents verified and allowed them to stay there.”
