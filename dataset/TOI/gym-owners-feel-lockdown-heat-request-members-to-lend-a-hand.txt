Coimbatore: Gym owners feel lockdown heat, request members to lend a hand
2020-06-12
COIMBATORE: While gyms and fitness centres are facing a serious crisis, a Vadavalli-based gym sent letters requesting members to pay Rs 2,000 as ‘compensation for three months lockdown’. Though the establishment clarified that it was not compulsory, industry sources balked at the idea.


Last week, several gyms and fitness centres submitted a petition to Coimbatore collector K Rajamani, requesting permission to reopen. With gyms closed for three months and no new memberships, they were struggling to meet their expenses including rent, electricity, disinfecting the space and salaries, they said. However, unless the state government allows fitness centres to reopen, the district administration would be unable to help.

As they did not get a reply, Lifestyle Fitness Studio in Vadavalli decided to approach members to bail them out. “We requested our members to pay Rs 2,000 as compensation,” said owner Manoj Kumar. “We were forced to do so and wanted our members to help and save us.”

But the fee is not compulsory, said co-owner Vijay. “Neither the bank that gave us loan nor our landlords agreed to give us a break despite the government orders.” Other gym owners were divided over the measure. “With no income and no options, the situation is bad. May be the gym will deduct whatever compensation they receive from members from their next membership renewal and make it all right,” said S Ravishankar of Ravi’s Crossfit.

A fitness instructor, who runs a gym on Avinashi Road, said, “We had members asking us not to freeze their membership as a small help to keep the gym running. But we said no, as we didn't feel it was right.”
