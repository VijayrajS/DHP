NASHIK: Four private hospitals in the city have sought permission from the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for treating Covid-19 patients. The hospital authorities said that they have arranged at least 150 beds for the purpose.


Civic officials said they will issue permission to the hospitals after conducting an inspection of the facilities. 

NMC has also decided to allow more such hospitals with the capacity of at least 30 beds. They said that more such hospitals need to be allowed to admit Covid-19 patients so that people do not have to travel long distances for treatment.

There are already government guidelines to reserve up to 80% beds in private hospitals.

“At present, we have adequate beds for institutional quarantining and treatment of Covid-19 patients in the city. But, we also come across some patients who do not wish to receive treatment in municipal or government hospitals,” said NMC officials.
