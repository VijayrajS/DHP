Road deaths go up with lockdown relaxation in May
2020-06-10
Nashik: The number of road accident-related fatalities in the city shot up to 16 in May after a relatively sedate April, when only 5 road accident deaths were reported. It is to be noted, there was strict lockdown in place in April and the streets had a much-reduced volume of vehicular traffic movement. 

The phase-wise lockdown relaxation in May saw more and more vehicles plying on the comparatively empty city roads. This led to accidents mainly because of overspeeding and human error of the drivers. 

Police said that in April, there was a strict lockdown, and permissions were granted only to people with medical emergencies or other urgent work. Police personnel too were deployed at strategic junctions to check the movement of motorists. However, in May, some industries reopened and movement of people also started increasing. 

The police said that to reign in the speed of motorists on the roads, the traffic signals were also made operational a few days back. 

The signals at important junctions ensure that motorists stop and pedestrians get a chance to cross the road. 

Police said their action against erring motorists continued even during the lockdown period. Those who were found driving without valid documents and police permissions were challaned by the traffic police.
