2020-05-03
Patna: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said on Saturday that the government would pay salaries to its officials, employees, contractual staff and those outsourced in various departments for the period of their absence from office for various reasons during lockdown from March 24 to May 3. 

Even the employees who travel daily by passenger trains and could not attend their offices would be paid their salaries. Further, officials who were on official tour with due permission but were stranded due to the lockdown would also enjoy the relief. 

Similarly, those who were absent without permission during the lockdown would also get their salaries as their absence is deemed as presence with sanction from a competent official.
