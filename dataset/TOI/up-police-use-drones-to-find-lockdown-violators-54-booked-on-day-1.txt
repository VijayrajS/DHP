MUZAFFARNAGAR: Police in UP’s Muzaffarnagar district have resorted to aerial surveillance to keep a tab on crowding in areas marked as Covid-19 hotspots. Drones flying overhead are spotting and taking photos of those violating the lockdown. “Those identified are being booked and FIRs are being sent at their doorsteps,” a police officer said.


On Thursday, police in Muzaffarnagar’s Kidwai Nagar area, which is a hotspot, registered 11 FIRs against 54 people after spotting them through drones.

Interestingly, as part of another novel initiative, copies of the FIRs are being delivered at the homes of the accused so that they don’t crowd the police stations. Local police are also announcing the names of lockdown violators over public broadcast systems in a bid to shame them for what it said “dangerous act” amid pandemic.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Muzaffarnagar Abhishek Yadav said, “We are using drone cameras, CCTV cameras, mobile phone footages to find such offenders and FIRs are being sent to their homes. We have booked more than 2,000 offenders so far.”

So far, 2,683 people have been booked for violating the lockdown in the district. Police have also slapped Rs 31 lakh penalty on 13,438 vehicle owners, caught driving on roads without any valid reason. Besides, 1,161 vehicles were impounded.
