PATNA: With fewer people venturing out due to the nationwide lockdown, crime across the state has witnessed a sharp decline. There has been an overall drop of 26% in the total number of cognisable offences from April 1 to 15 compared to the corresponding period in 2019.


A comparative data released by the state police headquarters on Tuesday revealed that murders witnessed a decline of 26% from April 1 to 15 this year. Cases of dacoity, loot, house burglary and theft also dropped during the period.

According to the official figures, altogether 7,181 cognisable offences were recorded in the state between April 1 and April 15 compared to 9,749 cases during the corresponding period in 2019. As many as 82 people were killed compared to 111 during the period in 2019.

Similarly, the cases of dacoity dropped to two from 10, cases of loot from 79 to 22, house burglary from 183 to 103 and theft from 1,392 to 442. There has been significant decline in the number of kidnapping cases for multiple purposes as well. Altogether 93 people were kidnapped in the state during the period compared to 492 in 2019.

The rate of crime against women has also dipped. A total of 28 rape cases were registered in the state compared to 63 cases during the corresponding period last year. Likewise, the cases of atrocities against women dropped to 73 from 217 in 2019.

The cases of atrocities against people belonging to the scheduled caste and the scheduled tribe have also dropped to 201 from 242 in 2019. Moreover, road accidents have reduced by 66% in the state during the period.

Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar attributed the reason for sharp drop in crime across the state to stepped up vigil during the lockdown period. 

“Both interdistrict and interstate borders have been sealed and vehicle-checking drives undertaken extensively. This has proved helpful in lowering the crime rate during the lockdown period. Moreover, we are tracking down all suspicious movement. The incidents of theft have come down as everyone is at home,” Kumar said and added that at some places, drones had been roped in to track movement on the streets.

Another senior police officer said, “The number of road accidents has dropped significantly as fewer vehicles are on the roads during the lockdown period.”
