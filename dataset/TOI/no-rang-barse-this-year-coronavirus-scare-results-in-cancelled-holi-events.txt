No rang barse this year?: Coronavirus scare results in cancelled Holi events
2020-03-06
On Wednesday, the Prime Minister’s official handle tweeted that “experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence, this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme.” Soon, several other political leaders also said that they are skipping Holi gatherings. Later, President Ram Nath Kovind’s office informed that the Rashtrapati Bhavan will not hold the traditional Holi gatherings as a precautionary measure. However, even before these announcements came, many people were already cancelling Holi parties and gatherings as a precaution against coronavirus. From large-scale events to smaller society gathering – the virus has impacted all Holi celebrations. 

Dilli Haat calls off Holi event, Holi Moo to refund tickets
Delhi Tourism’s annual Holi events, which were supposed to take place at Dilli Haat, INA, and Dilli Haat, Janakpuri, have been cancelled. A Delhi Tourism official tells us, “Our annual Holi event has been cancelled due to measures taken by the Delhi Government to contain the coronavirus outbreak.”
Several large-scale parties across NCR are organised for Holi, but this year, the coronavirus threat looms large over them. Holi Moo, which is organised in Asiad village in Hauz Khas, has been cancelled due to the same reason. Anshuman Gulati, Festival Director at Holi Moo, issued a statement that they’ve cancelled Holi celebrations due to coronavirus scare. He said in a statement, “We have decided not to go ahead with the festival this year. The safety and security of all our patrons is always a matter of paramount importance to us. For all those who have already purchased tickets to the festival, be rest assured, your transaction amount will be refunded within 10 working days.” 

NCR RWAs cancel Holi Milan as residents fret over coronavirus
Following the sudden rise in coronavirus cases in NCR, many residential societies are cancelling their Holi events. In Delhi, URJA – United Residents Joint Action, the apex body of RWAs, has issued an advisory to all residents’ associations to not hold “public engagements” or Holi programmes.
Raja Puri, Secretary, N Block RWA GK-1, says, “We had organised Holi Milan in our society on March 10, but after the news of the party hosted by a coronavirus patient came out, we started getting calls from our society members asking to cancel the event. They don’t want to take a risk by participating in any public event, so we had to cancel it. People are not sending kids to schools if they don’t have exams, so celebrating Holi in a big event seems out of question.”
After Defence Colony residents wrote to the Defence Colony Club, asking to cancel their Holi celebrations, a meeting was organised and the Holi function was called off. Several other societies, including Malviya Nagar, GK-1, South Ex-II, Geetanjali Enclave also cancelled their Holi celebrations.
Ruby Makhija, RWA president, Navjiwan Vihar, says, “On Wednesday, we informed our society members with regret about our decision to cancel our annual Holi lunch. We’re aware that this year no gathering could be organised because of coronavirus. Safety comes first, and that’s why we’ve cancelled the celebrations. I have also written to all the RWAs to cancel their events as well. Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association, says, “A couple of societies in Noida and Gr Noida have informed us that they have cancelled Holi celebrations in their societies. In other societies, the celebrations are going to very different this year. For instance, there won’t be rain dances. While we have issued a health advisory to all societies, we have not issued an advisory to cancel Holi events yet. We’re monitoring the situation and we will take a decision within the next two-three days.”

No hugging at Holi parties
To prevent spread of the virus, advisories recommend people to not shake hands, hug or kiss each other on the cheek. However, Delhiites say that since Holi is all about hugging, even strangers, they are worried that they might forget to not do so at Holi parties, Dimple Gulati, who lives in South Ex, says, “On Holi, people hug everyone they meet at parties. In coronavirus advisories, doctors are asking to not even shake hands. I don’t think we’ll be able to do that at parties, so I decided not to go for any Holi pool parties. I’ve excused myself saying that I’ve sore throat and cold.” Inderpreet Bakshi, a resident of Gurgaon Golf Course Road, says, “Post Holi, we host a dinner for friends at our residence. We were finalising the invite designs when the coronavirus cases in India were reported. So we decided to cancel our dinner because half of my friends will anyway not be attending now. Earlier, when there were no cases in India, even then, as a precaution, we had decided to keep hand sanitisers on all the tables. But now, we’ve cancelled it because it’s not possible to refuse hugs and handshakes at Holi events.”
