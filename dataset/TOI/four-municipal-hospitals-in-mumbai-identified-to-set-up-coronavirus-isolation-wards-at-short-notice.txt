MUMBAI: Four municipal hospitals where isolation wards can be set up at short notice in case of a Covid-19 outbreak have been identified by the BMC, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Tuesday. Currently, only Kasturba hospital has an isolation ward in the city.


The hospitals shortlisted are Hinduhridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari; Bhabha hospital in Bandra, Bhabha hospital in Kurla and Rajawadi in Ghatkopar. “The goal is to have over 500 isolation beds, including those in private hospitals. In case of an outbreak, there should be effective measures in place to contain the spread as the population density in Mumbai is high,” Kakani said.

 
 
Among the other measures being taken by the municipal corporation include upgrading facilities in Kasturba, developing facilities at other locations by roping in more civic, state government and private hospitals.

Kakani said the BMC has already started talks with two private hospitals. He said the third step would be to ensure adequate stock of medicine, material and protective gear, enough to last at least 10 days. “We have also issued a tender for long-term purchases so that we can procure material as and when we want,” he said, adding that finally if an outbreak does occur, the BMC would also focus on spreading awareness and information on combating the virus.

The state had also told government medical colleges to be ready to set up isolation wards. “Isolation wards could be set up in district hospitals so that there are over 500 isolation beds to tackle an outbreak,” Dr Pradeep Awate, disease surveillance officer, state government, said.

Awate was speaking at a discussion organised by the Observer Research Foundation on ‘Combating Coronavirus’. He said surveillance was being carried out at the district level where telephonic contact was made with travellers who had been to places under Covid-19 threat. “If they develop any symptoms, they are referred to isolation wards,” he said.

He said 3,245 samples had been tested in the country so far and that many of these were repeat tests done after 15 days of quarantine. “In the last four days itself, 365 samples were tested,” he said.

The BMC has also been tracking passengers who arrived from countries battling the virus outbreak. “Even if they are asymptomatic, we make a phone call to them for 14 days. We have deputed people for this,” Kakani said.
