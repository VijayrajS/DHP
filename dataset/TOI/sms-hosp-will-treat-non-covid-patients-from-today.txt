JAIPUR: Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital, which was converted into a Covid-19 centre, will now handle others patients. RUHS Hospital at Pratap Nagar will be the new Covid-19 treatment hospital in the city. 


In an effort to make SMS Hospital free from Covid-19 patients, the last 61 patients were shifted to RUHS Hospital by ambulances on Saturday. 

“From Monday, SMS Hospital will treat all kinds of patients. In the initial period, the OPD, IPD and emergency services for such patients was available at SMS Hospital,” said health minister Raghu Sharma. 

Sharma said Covid-19 experts from SMS Hospital will take care of patients at RUHS Hospital. 

However, OPD for influenza-like illness patients will continue at Charak Bhawan, which will be shifted to Pharmacy College soon. 

Mahila Chikitsalaya will continue treating Covid-19 patients, while Zanana hospital will provide services to non-Covid-19 patients. Recently, Jaipuria Hospital has also been made non-Covid-19 institute. 

With the increase in pandemic cases in the city, the state government had converted SMS Hospital into a Covid-19 centre in March. 

In the past two months, the OPD registration at SMS Hospital suffered badly and it came down to 10% to 20% as non-Covid patients, due to fear and apprehension of getting infected, did not come for treatment. “We have completed all the preparations to treat non-Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Ajit Singh, additional superintendent, SMS Hospital.
