Trichy: As the summer is settin in and mercury levels climbing upwards to 40C, people working out in the sultry weather such as police and sanitary workers during the lockdown are vulnerable to dehydration. To keep them hydrated, S Manikandan, 30, has been going around the city on his moped distributing drinking water free of cost.Manikandan, a diploma holder and entrepreneur running a home service start-up, steps out of his house in Ariyamangalam around 7am with a 20 litre water can and gives policemen guarding containment zones and crucial checkpoints drinking water. The water cans are sponsored by his friend R Prabakar. “Although police personnel have water bottles, many of them would have exhausted it due to the sultry weather. I reach out to them and refill their water bottles,” Manikandan added. He also carries an empty water bottle and disposable glasses to serve sanitary workers he comes across. He has been completely exhausting 4-5 bubble top water cans every day. Apart from water, he spends Rs 500- Rs 600 every day to but bread loafs from a wholesale bakery unit near his house and distributes it to cops and around 20-25 homeless people. He covers an area of 5km radius from his house including Crawford, Kattur, Thiruverumbur and Ponmalai with the help of his volunteer pass issued by the authorities till noon. “Several volunteers are providing lunch for the homeless people but breakfast for those who make roads their home is rare. So, I provide them bread packets in the morning,” Manikandan said. He added that he will continue the service every day till the lockdown is lifted.
