Char Dham portals to open on due dates; call on yatra after decision on lockdown extension
2020-04-09
Dehradun: With Uttarakhand government recommending the Centre to extend the Covid-19 lockdown, an uncertainty shrouds the format of the Char Dham Yatra this year. 

Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI on Wednesday that he is scheduled to hold a video conferencing session with the district magistrates of Rudraprayag, Uttarkashi, and Chamoli to discuss the preparations and other matters related to the Char Dham Yatra. However, a final call would be taken only after Centre’s decision on lockdown extension and its duration. Maharaj said, “The portals of all the four shrines will be opened on the due dates. We will ensure that our preparations are in place but the yatra format will be finalised only after Centre’s announcement on lockdown.”

The minister said that the state was planning to seal the border of three districts — where the four revered shrines are located — after the lockdown ends. “The pilgrims would be allowed only after a proper thermal check-up and scanning. Their mobile numbers, the phone number of their drivers, vehicle numbers, route to be taken, and their detailed itinerary would be mentioned in a log book, so that we can track them at any time,” said the minister. 

On the issue of medical facility, he said that teams would be deployed at the district borders and also on the routes. “We will consult the priests and till the time the lockdown is lifted, the activities at Char Dham may be limited to rituals being performed by priests,” he added.

The portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri are to be opened on April 26, followed by Kedarnath on April 29 and Badrinath on April 30. Last year, the yatra saw a record turnout of over 32 lakh pilgrims. Both Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines recorded a pilgrim footfall of over 10 lakh each.
