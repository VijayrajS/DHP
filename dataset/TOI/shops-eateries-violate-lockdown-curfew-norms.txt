MACHHIWARA AND SAMRALA (LUDHIANA): Imposition of lockdown and curfew in view of coronavirus scare failed to stop several eateries, shops and vends from putting life of people at stake in several parts of Ludhiana.


While several eateries misused the exemption given under the lockdown and served customers on their premises in violation of the norms, several other shops and vends Machhiwara, Samrala and Doraha areas did not shut their units when the curfew was imposed at 2pm.

A large number of people had lunch at an eatery on the road between Samrala and Machhiwara. At another nearby eatery, two persons had lunch on a cot. In the same market, a vehicle workshop was also open. 

In the Machhiwara town, most of the shops were closed and the township wore a deserted look.

Gurdeep Singh, a local resident, said people from villages had come to the town on Monday morning to buy eatables. He said afterwards, there was not much activity in the town.

On Neelon-Doraha road, a liquor vend was open even after the curfew was imposed by the district administration. 

During curfew, many people were also seen driving in Khanna, Machhiwara, Samrala, Jagraon and Raikot areas.

Samrala SDM Geetika Singh, under whose jurisdiction Machhiwara and Samrala come, said that she would check whether the eateries were serving food to people on the premises or not. She said during curfew, people are not allowed to go out and can do so only during relaxation hours.
