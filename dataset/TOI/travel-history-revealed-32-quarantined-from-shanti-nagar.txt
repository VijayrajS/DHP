2020-04-15
Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) containment team led by Dr Minakshi Mane on Tuesday picked up 26 persons, including a big family from Mahesh Nagar in Shanti Nagar, as part of the contact tracing of 53-year-old nephew of the city’s first Covid-19 victim from Satranjipura. Another team traced the nephew’s six friends, with whom he had been on a trip, from Shanti Nagar and Azam Shah Chowk, and quarantined them.So far, NMC had been carrying out containment drive in Satranjipura following the death of the 68-year-old man on April 5. The wife of the 53-year-old nephew, who is a Haj and Umrah tour operator, tested positive on Monday. The big family is of the tour operator’s elder brother.On April 14, TOI had highlighted how Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) was clueless about the nephew’s travel history, and officials only swung into action after a tip off by this paper.The Mahesh Nagar-based family of the tour operator’s elder brother was placed in institutional quarantine at MLA Hostel.This family had remained out of the radar of the NMC containment team led by additional medical officer health Dr Praveen Ganatwar mainly because of their reliance on the tour operator’s verbal submissions.His profession had been recorded as ‘cushion works’ by NMC officials, thus missing the most important link in containing the spread of the deadly disease.The NMC team later came to know that he was also running an international tour agency, yet it never cared to investigate further.TOI investigations revealed the tour operator had deliberately hidden his travel details to allegedly stay away from the subsequent complications of institutional quarantine and testing for coronavirus. His elder brother from Mahesh Nagar and his family too had attempted to distance themselves from the Satranjipura Covid-hit family. The elder brother is politically connected and an influential hotelier.Residing in the same locality, the tour operator had attended the funeral of his uncle-in-law (the Covid-19 victim). It came as a shocker for some community members when his presence at the funeral was attributed as the reason for him testing positive on April 11. The NMC officials ruled out this theory on Monday when they went into the details of his travel history.The tour operator’s family had visited their ailing uncle before his death on April 1. His three sons (aged 23, 20 and 16) and 80-year-old mother’s test results are now awaited.Interestingly, despite the tour operator and his wife testing positive, GMCH officials allegedly turned away the tour operator’s six friends, who had accompanied him to a marriage at Bareilly from March 19 to 23. NMC placed them in institutional quarantine at MLA Hostel.As per officials, the six friends didn’t disclose to GMCH staff that they had travelled to Bareilly, but only said they were his friends.The tour operator had also travelled to Mecca from Feb 4 and Feb 14. The air tickets were checked by officials on Monday. Unlike others from Satranjipura, the containment team is not considering them as suspects.The tour operator was also in regular touch with his elder brother after his Saudi Arabia tour, officials said.
