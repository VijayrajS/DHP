RUDRAPUR: A 35-year-old man, who was recently operated for brain tumour at a Delhi hospital, died after allegedly showing Covid-19 symptoms late night on Wednesday. On being informed, health officials on Thursday took blood samples of eight other members of the family, and quarantined them. 


Officials said the preventive measures are being taken because the doctor who had conducted the surgery on the deceased, was later detected Covid-19 -positive.

Amarjeet Singh, the city health officer (CHO) of Kashipur municipal corporation, said Wasim Mohammad of Punjabi Sarai Colony was operated upon for brain tumor at Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi some 20 days ago. He returned home to Kashipur after being discharged. On Wednesday, after he complained of cough and breathlessness, his kin took him to a private hospital, from where he was referred to a higher centre. But he succumbed on the way and was later buried by his kin. 

“We have collected blood samples of all family members and sent them for examination. They have been quarantined, and if reports show anyone has the disease, we will seal the whole colony. Meanwhile, we are also tracking all those who came in contact with the deceased,” said CHO Singh. 

He also said he has received information that the doctor who operated Wasim has tested corona positive. “We are taking the case seriously and will act as per health ministry guidelines, after the reports arrive,” he added.
