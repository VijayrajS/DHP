Lockdown curbs hit pet food stocks in Vizag and Vijayawada
2020-04-09
VISAKHAPATNAM: The lockdown has made procuring pet food a challenge for pet owners with most shops in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada running out of stock. Proprietors of pet shops also claim that when attempting home delivery of pet food, police are stopping them at some junctions.


“Stocks of pet food were not available at the pharmacies in locality. On Monday I drove around 10 kms to buy the food,” said M Arun Kumar, a resident of Madhurawada in Visakhapatnam.

Pharmacies confirmed that they were running low on supplies as several pet owners had stocked up in bulk in the initial days of the lockdown. “We don’t procure pet foods in bulk. Whatever stocks we had got exhausted. Fresh supplies are not coming,” said Gangaprasad Rao, owner of a pharmacy.

Nor do all localities in the two cities have a pet shop in close proximity. “We tried to home deliver pet food but police are stopping us at several crossings across the city. Now, we are delivering only to places where we are sure that police is not there. Pet food should have been an essential commodity,” said M Prasad, owner of a pet shop in Visakhapatnam. “The situation is the same here,” added Sai Latha, owner of a pet shop in Vijayawada.

As an alternative, vets suggest pet owners switch over to homemade food. “If they are accustomed to packaged pet foods they might be reluctant to eat homemade food initially but would eventually get used to it,” said Makenna Srinu, a vet in Vijayawada.
