MADURAI: The district health department on Tuesday began the process of screening passengers arriving by international flights at the Madurai International Airport for any presence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was first reported from Wuhan, China.


Speaking to reporters, deputy director of health services, Dr Priya Raj said that passengers from the four flights that are coming to Madurai airport from other countries are being screened. 

“We have a team with a doctor in the airport. We are screening only passengers who have had a history of travelling to China, particularly during the last one month or so. If someone is symptomatic, we will quarantine or follow up with them for around 20 days,” she said. She further said that district health officials are only on alert and so far there has been no requirement for implementing any other preventive or precautionary measures.

S Senthil Valavan, who took charge as director of Madurai Airport on Tuesday, said the health department contacted them for screening of passengers for which they have allotted space required for the medical team. Boards have been erected informing passengers on the medical check-up they may have to undergo at the terminal.

Meanwhile, the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai is set to open a special ward on Wednesday to isolate and treat patients who might be carrying coronavirus.

So far, there has been no confirmed coronavirus positive case in India. However, some patients with acute respiratory illness have reportedly been isolated in Kerala on suspicion of carrying the virus, prompting Tamil Nadu health officials to be on high alert.
