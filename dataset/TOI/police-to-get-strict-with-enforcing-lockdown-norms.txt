2020-05-19
PANAJI: With the rise in Covid-19 cases in the state, Goa Police has decided to strictly enforce between 7pm to 7am so that people are not seen out on streets. 


Speaking to TOI, north Goa superintendent of police Utkrisht Prasoon said that police have also started conducting surprise checks at public places to check whether people are wearing face masks. “We have started imposing fines on those found not wearing face masks,” he said.
He also said that the police department’s focus currently is to streamline the process for migrants to return to their native states. On Monday, Prasoon visited the migrants camp at Mapusa and assured them that the train to their state would be arranged and till that time they should not become restless.

On Sunday migrants came out of their camp demanding that they be allowed to go back to their respective states, some of who threatened to walk home if trains were not arranged for them. Prasoon said that they are also helping senior citizens, women, disabled at railway stations to board trains. 

With migrant labourers stranded in Goa getting restless to return to their native states, inspector general of police (IGP) Jaspal Singh directed Goa Police personnel to “deal with migrants with compassion”.

Around one lakh migrant labourers have registered with the nodal officer to leave the state, of which over 15,000 have already left in trains, buses and private vehicles.

Over the past couple of days, migrants have been seen gathering in large numbers at the border check-posts to leave the state. A few workers were seen walking along the railway tracks as well.

TOI had also reported that migrants who have failed to get travel permits have been trying to cross the border illegally. Hungry, angry and frustrated they are willing to walk thousands of kilometres to get home.
