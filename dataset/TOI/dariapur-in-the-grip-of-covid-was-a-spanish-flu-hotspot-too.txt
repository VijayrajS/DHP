AHMEDABAD: The Unesco’s World Heritage City of Ahmedabad, which Mughal emperor Humayun referred as the ‘most embellished city of the world’ while ordering its army not to vandalize it nearly five centuries ago, has emerged as a disease and death trap on many occasions.


Here, the most congested Dariapur area in the overcrowded walled city, which is a hotspot for coronavirus epidemic currently, was also reported to be in grip of the highly virulent Spanish Flu epidemic in 1918. 

Currently, the Dariapur areas has reported 75 Covid-19 cases of the total 373 cases in Ahmedabad.

Similar was the case with Dariapur 102 years ago, when deadly Spanish Flu struck India killing nearly 1.7 crore of its population. Ahmedabad too witnessed heavy loss of life with 3,527 persons reported dead within six months. 

Among many areas of Ahmedabad, Dariapur attracted notice of historians, as the book ‘The Spanish Influenza Pandemic of 1918-1919: New Perspectives’ mentions, “The epidemic was particularly virulent in the crowded localities, like Dariapur…”

Braving many such odds in the history, Dariapur continued to be thickly populated as ever. The 0.79 square-kilometre area in Ahmedabad is the hotspot for Covid-19 outbreak with 75 cases recorded till date. This area has a population of 63,644 packed into 13,170 households, according to the 2015 AMC property tax survey.

Dariapur and neighbouring Jamalpur account for 122 Covid19 cases in the city. Urban health centre officials of Dariapur claim that highly clustered localities and neighbourhood makes social distancing difficult. “Many bylanes of areas like Dariapur, Kalupur, Khadia and Jamalpur become informal vending places during morning hours,” says a health official.
