2020-04-11
Kannur: The Covid-19 scenario in Kannur is gradually coming under control with the number of people under home quarantine coming down drastically and also many people testing negative in the last few days. But the surveillance in the areas under Thalassery taluk has become stringent because majority of the Covid-19 positive cases have been reported from there.As on April 9, of the total 59 positive cases, 48 are from Thalassery taluk, including eight people from one family and their immediate relatives. Besides, two people who tested positive are from Mahe, bordering Thalassery. Incidentally, barring a few primary contacts, most positive cases are returnees from Gulf countries, according to officials.As reported earlier, a majority of infected people in the Malabar region are from Naif region and surrounding areas of Dubai, or those in contact from those places, according to health officials. Before the airports were closed many people from Dubai, especially Naif, had reached here.As part of the stringent surveillance, ‘double lockdown’ was enforced in three municipalities (Thalassery, Panoor and Koothuparamba) and seven panchayats (Chittariparamba, Kottayam Malabar, Kathiroor, Patyam, Mokeri, Chokli and Panniyannur) a few days ago.The highest numbers of cases were reported from Chittariparamba and Kottayam Malabar – eight each. In Patyam, seven positive cases were reported while in Koothuparamba it was five.“We have noted that the main cause of the increased number from this taluk is because there are many people working in Gulf countries. Hence, we have decided to conduct testing for all primary contacts of those who tested positive, to ensure there is no spread,” said Kannur district medical officer K Narayana Nayak. Some people without any symptom had tested positive, prompting the authorities to take this decision. Kannur is the first district in the state to take the decision to subject all primary contacts of high-risk cases for Covid-19 test, said the DMO.
