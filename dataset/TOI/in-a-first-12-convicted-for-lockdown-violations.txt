NAGPUR: Judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) NK Meshram on Monday convicted 12 persons, fining them Rs700 each, for violating the orders of the national lockdown. This is possibly the first conviction in cases for violating curfew in the state or the region.


The court order brought cheer to the police department. Court observed that the accused ‘knowingly malignantly did an act by wandering in the society which is likely to be spread the infection of Corona disease which is dangerous to life and thereby committed an offence’. The convictions will be a deterrent for others. 

The chargesheets were sent to the court by senior inspector Hemant Kharabe of MIDC police station under supervision of Zonal DCP Vivek Masaal, Jt CP Ravindra Kadam and CP BK Upadhyay, in the cases registered between March 28 and April 2.

Under Section 188 of IPC, the court slapped fine of Rs200 or in default four days of imprisonment for disobeying order issued by an official. In addition, the court had also levied fine of Rs500 or a simple imprisonment of one month holding them guilty of violating Section 270 of IPC for their act that may have led to the spread of the disease.

Kharabe said it may look like small fine small but none of the convicted would be eligible for passport or even government services now. “The guilty persons paid the fine and walked away,” he said. 

CP Upadhyay too lauded the efforts of PI Kharabe stating such conviction may be unprecedented in the state. 

Meanwhile, city police kept a tight vigil for restricting any movement in the two sealed localities of Satranjipura and Mominpura due to Covid-19 related complications. Zonal DCP Rahul Maknikar, who led a route march in the localities, said around 200 cops had been deployed. Police registered 321 offences against violators on Monday and seized 45 vehicles.
