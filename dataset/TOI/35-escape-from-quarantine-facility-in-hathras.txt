Agra: In a shocking incident, at least 35 local residents, who had returned to Hathras in the last 15 days and were quarantined at Bisawar primary school, escaped from the government facility on Wednesday night. 

Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar said that panchayat secretary KP Singh, who was on duty, has been suspended and an FIR has been registered against the missing persons under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC along with section 4 of the Epidemic Disease Act.

He added that six persons, however, returned later, but 29 were still missing. “The administration will soon locate and put them again at the quarantine facility. Though no one had symptoms of Covid-19, they were quarantined for 14 days as a precautionary measure,” he said, adding that there are directions by the state government to put all persons, who returned to their home towns during the lockdown period, in a state-run facility for a defined period. 

One of the persons, who was quarantined at Bisawar primary school, claimed that around 55 persons were present inside the facility on Wednesday. However, after the dinner, only 12 persons remained. He claimed that the security guard was also not available at night.

On March 29, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had issued directions to district officials to keep people who had arrived in the state during lockdown under quarantine. Their names, addresses and phone numbers have been made available to the district magistrates and they are being monitored. 

According to sources, around 3 lakh migrant workers started marching towards their domicile states after the announcement of 21 days lockdown on March 25.
