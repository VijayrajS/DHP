Covid homes’ waste disposal rules bent in Telangana
2020-04-03
HYDERABAD: The ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) has advised state governments to treat waste from houses with quarantined people as bio-medical waste, but several urban local bodies (ULBs) in Telangana, including GHMC, are not implementing the advisory issued by the central government. 


As per the advisory, all households where residents are under home quarantine should be provided yellow garbage bags. Unlike regular waste which is collected by ULBs, the bio-medical waste is disposed of by private agencies that collect and incinerate it. 

The agencies are collecting waste from state-run quarantine centres and houses of Covid-19 patients, but are turning a blind eye towards houses where residents are home quarantined. The ministry also stated that safety gear, including masks and gloves from non-quarantined households, should be treated as domestic hazardous waste. 

As per norms, the waste should be wrapped separately, collected and transported without mixing with normal household waste. Officials, however, say they are following government orders issued by the state and central governments.

“As advised by the government, the waste from houses where people were tested positive for Covid-19 is being disposed of by agencies that collect waste from hospitals,” said Rahul Raj, GHMC additional commissioner for health.
