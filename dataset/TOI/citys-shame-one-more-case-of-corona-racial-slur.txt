Kolkata’s shame: One more case of coronavirus racial slur
2020-03-26
KOLKATA: A woman from Kalimpong was refused grocery items by a shop owner because of her Mongolian features on Tuesday. The incident happened a few days after a youth from the Hills had been subjected to racial abuse at Tagore Park in the city. The woman, an air hostess, whose brother is a student of Jadavpur University, has locked herself in the apartment since the racial slur on her. 


“This is not the first time that I faced such incident. Many people from the Hills or north-eastern states have to face the same thing. People taunt us as Chinese. Normally, I don’t react to such comments but this time it was scary,” said the woman.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on lockdown on Tuesday, the woman went out to buy vegetables from a nearby shop. There was a queue where she stood, waiting for her turn. She asked for 1kg potato but the shop owner refused her, though he had enough stock of the vegetable. 

The woman heard some people making comments about her in Bengali. “I understand Bengali and those people were calling me Chinese carrying coronavirus. I decided not to waste my time there and went to another shop. Thankfully, he sold me what I needed,” she recounted.

The woman has been staying in the city for eight years and never did she face such harassment before. “Kolkata was not like this. It used to welcome everyone despite their ethnicity or religion. But it has changed suddenly after t”he coronavirus scare. It is sad a section of the society tries to distance us in the time of crisis," she said.
