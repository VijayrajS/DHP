Andhra Pradesh: Woman allowed to stay with Covid-19 positive child
2020-06-08
VISAKHAPATNAM: In a baffling case for doctors, nearly a dozen members from two families living in a building at Kurmannapalem have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last few days, but one of women in the family tested negative.

As a special case, a Covid negative woman was allowed to stay with her child who tested positive for Covid, in the hospital as the child refused to stay without her mother. 

Problems arose when the child started crying and refused to be admitted without the mother. To deal with the peculiar problem, doctors decided to keep the mother along with the child in the hospital.

Speaking to TOI, Dr P V Sudhakar, Special Officer for Covid for three north coastal Andhra districts said, “It is surprising that one sole member did not test positive when all other family members have been affected by the virus. Two members from the two families contracted the virus presumably from a pharmaceutical lab where they worked. All the Covid positive members have been sent to the hospital. However, it cannot be ruled out that the virus is in incubation period and the woman may test positive after a few days. But when for now she has tested negative, we cannot keep her in a quarantine centre with other suspects.” 

“Finally, we decided to let the Covid negative mother stay with her asymptomatic daughter. The mother was sensitized about the strict safety measures to be taken and minimise contact with her child,” the doctor said.
