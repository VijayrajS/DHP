Don’t violate lockdown in Ramzan: Cleric
2020-04-13
Lucknow: With a fortnight left for the holy month of Ramzan, chairperson of Islamic Centre of India and Imam of Aishbagh Eidgah, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, has advised Muslims to observe roza and perform allied religious practices at home, in keeping with lockdown norms.

The Sunni cleric, who is also a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), on Sunday, said the holy month is likely to begin from April 25 and the nationwide lockdown may be extended beyond April 14. 

“So, people are advised to observe roza (fasting) and iftar (meal to break fast) in evenings at home. There should be no congregational prayers in mosques and namaz should be offered at home. Only those who stay or are staying in mosques should pray there, but they should also adhere to social distancing norms,” the cleric said .

In a 12-point advisory, the cleric exhorted people to fast and pray for the end of the covid-19 pandemic in the holy month. 

“And those who arrange iftar parties should instead give the money in charity. Not more than five people should be present at a time in a mosque and people should perform the ‘taraweeh’ at home,” the cleric said.

Days before Shab-e-Bara’at, both Shia and Sunni clerics had appealed to Muslims to pray at home and not visit graveyards. 

To ensure compliance of lockdown, gates of several graveyards in the city were locked by caretakers in Lucknow.

Earlier, the government made it clar that there would be no point in easing the lockdown if there was even a single case of coronavirus in the state.
