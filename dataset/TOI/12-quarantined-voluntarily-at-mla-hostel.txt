NAGPUR: Amid occupants complaining of poor amenities, the quarantine facility at MLA Hostel also has persons voluntarily turning up for a stay. As the number of occupants reached 154 on Sunday, there were 12 who have come in voluntarily, said officials here.


On Saturday, six persons came voluntarily, followed by four on Sunday. This takes the number to 12 after taking into account those who had comer earlier, said an official managing the facility. They have preferred to stay here to avoid spreading infection to others in the family and neighbourhood. The number increased as awareness spread, said the officials.

Some have travelled from abroad, but reached Nagpur through a domestic flight or any other mode where the screening is not done, said the official. Such passengers too are expected to remain home quarantined, some of them have come here, the source said. From Monday onwards, there will be no international flights till March 29.

TOI came across a couple who had travelled from Dubai but had reached Hyderabad first and reached Nagpur by train. The husband, a fitness trainer, said, “I already have patients at home and I don’t want to add to their troubles by staying with them. I have a home at Nagpur but will spend time at the quarantine facility first,” he said.

The officials said they will have to stay for 48 hours at least. Rounds by psychiatrists continued at the facility. Source said occupants have been provided with religious books and sessions on stress management are being carried out. They have been advised to practice yoga and breathing exercises. No clinical signs of mental stress has been seen in the occupants so far, the source said.
