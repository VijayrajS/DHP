2020-05-25
INDORE: There are pockets in city with high number of Corona cases, where spread of the disease is happening at community level, which is also the case in other majorly hit cities, said Dr AB Vajpayee of All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Kolkata. Dr Vajpayee and Dr Shamita Mondal from AIIH, Kolkata were in city oversee the strategy for preventing the virus from spreading. 

He said, “Effective lockdown has helped in reducing number of new positive cases in the city but it is not a permanent solution. Bit it is the only solution for now.” 

The team was satisfied with ongoing strategy for containing the virus. Vajpayee said, “The administration has planned the strategy at micro level. People will come outside after a time because of basic necessities like food.” The administration has been providing food to the poorest through community kitchen with a daily budget of Rs 1 crore. The other requirements are also fulfilled through the other means, said Vajpayee. “I like two three measures very much including this. The other is providing pulse-o-meter for regular monitoring of oxygen content in high-risk people. These people are asked to provide a photograph of the reading regularly on an app used for monitoring the population,” said Vajpayee. If oxygen content of any of the person is found low, a team rushes to his place. Also, home quarantining of contacts traced is also one of the good measures, said Vajpayee.

These measures aren’t there in many of the cities like Kolkata and Mumbai. As lockdown is lifted, infection will begin to increase. But, before that people should be aware of how to follow precautionary measures in post-lockdown period till vaccine comes, said Vajpayee. To stop virus from spreading through herd immunity, around 60% of population needed to be infected. If this stage is reached, the death number will be very high, hospitals will be full, said Vajpayee.
