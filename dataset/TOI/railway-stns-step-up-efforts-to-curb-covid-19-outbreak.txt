Prayagraj: More frequent cleaning, disinfecting overbridges and sanitising coaches are among the few measures launched by the North Central Railway’s (NCR) Prayagraj division to avoid a potential outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Public relations officer of NCR’s Prayagraj division SK Gupta said, “Trains are one of the most common modes of public transport and are more susceptible to a contagion. We have launched several measures to check the spread of the virus on trains.”

Air conditioners in trains under Prayagraj division will now be running at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius to sanitise coaches, he added. 

NCR authorities have stepped up the frequency of cleaning of blankets, bed sheets, pillow covers, towels and curtains at the mechanised laundry facility, operating at Leader Road. 

Apart from ensuring that coaches are being cleaned regularly, NCR is spraying disinfectants around toilets.

The stairs and pathway of foot overbridges too are being sanitised to wipe out harmful viruses.

The iron handles used by passengers to enter coaches and handles of escalators are being covered in rubber sheets at railway stations. 

Seats, railings of foot overbridges and ramps are being cleaned by steam spray. Guards and loco-pilots have been provided with hand sanitisers, said the PRO.

Provision of quarantine wards have also been made at major railway stations of the division including Prayagraj and Kanpur.
