Coronavirus scare: Delhi University teachers want to work from home
2020-03-16
NEW DELHI: Several members of the Delhi University’s Academic Council (AC) have written to the varsity’s vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, requesting that teachers should also be asked to work from home after the university announced closure of classes till March 31.

In their letter, four AC members stated that while they welcome DU’s “prompt decision to suspend classes for all students”, they feel that teachers should also be exempted.

“Many principals have asked teachers to compulsorily report to their respective colleges despite the suspension of classes, even though the varsity’s press release clearly insists on making e-resources available to students on a weekly basis,” the letter said.

The AC members suggested that both students and teachers should be allowed to work from home so that “unnecessary travelling of over 10,000 people can be further reduced. To further minimise contact points, administrative offices should be maintained at a minimal on a roster.” 

The teachers also demanded extension of the semester to cover up for the lost hours of regular teaching-learning and make corresponding changes in the examination schedule.
