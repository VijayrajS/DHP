Visakhapatnam: The Vizianagaram district authorities have urged people to volunteer for free medical service to deal with the rising cases of coronavirus. Close to 10,000 trained people are needed in the district to deal with the current situation.

The collector held a review meet over the prevailing situation in Vizianagaram on Monday. He said there is a need for an additional 339 doctors, 4,600 staff nurses, 54 lab technicians, 64 pharmacists, 4,600 health workers and 18 microbioligists.

Clarifying on the minimum required qualifications, the district collector M Hari Jawhar Lal said, “Those volunteering as doctors must be at least MBBS qualified, while those volunteering as staff nurses must have either General Nursing and Midwifery (GNM) or BSc degrees and should be qualified in ICU training. Lab technicians should be DMLT holders, while microbiologists should be post graduate degree holders in microbiology.” 

Field health workers must have a MPHW diploma and counselors should at least be graduates. 

Sources in the district administration pointed out that the appeal for volunteers is being made because of the increasing number of isolation and quarantine wards being set up and and tests being done.

Regarding the manner in which the testing base can be increased, Jawahar Lal said measures must be taken to ensure that people come forward voluntarily.
