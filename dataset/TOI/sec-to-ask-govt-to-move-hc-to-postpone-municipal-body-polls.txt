2020-03-16
JAIPUR: After collectors of Jaipur and Kota urged department of local self government (LSG) to reschedule and postpone the elections to the six newly-formed municipal corporations in the wake of coronavirus, the department on Sunday wrote to the state election commission (SEC) requesting it to consider the same. Hence, the commission, instead of taking a decision on deferring the elections, will urge the state government to move the High Court and get the elections postponed, according to sources. 


Rajasthan High Court had directed the state government to complete the elections to the municipal corporations in the state by April 18. 

Jaipur collector Joga Ram and Kota collector Om Prakash Kasara on Saturday wrote to secretary local self government department (LSG) Bhawani Singh Detha urging him to postpone elections scheduled for April 5. The elected ward members will elect the mayors on April 16. ACS (health) Rohit Singh had also written to state election commission to postpone the polls.

Meanwhile, minister of state for women and child development (independent charge) Mamta Bhupesh issued directions to keep all Anganwadi centres and mini Anganwadi centres closed till March 31, as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus. The Rajasthan government decided on Friday to close schools, colleges, coaching centres, gymnasium, movie theatres and theatre halls till March 30.
