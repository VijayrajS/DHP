Pythons entering human settlements in Terai due to lockdown, opine experts
2020-05-30
RUDRAPUR: As two nests of Indian rock pythons have been found in densely populated areas of Udham Singh Nagar within a week’s time, wildlife experts opine that big serpents are finding it easier to lay eggs and crawl into abandoned places due to the ongoing lockdown and the consequent dip in movement of humans. The experts, however, add that their significant breeding is a good sign for the environment.

Earlier, nests of venomous snakes were found in a city-based godown and in Barwala village of Bazpur town. 

Wildlife expert Dr Sunil Thokal told TOI "Terai region and the plains stretching till Shivalik Range in Haridwar are the most suitable habitats for pythons as the area has sufficient number of animals — rodents, mammals, lizards, deer, and birds — to prey on. Breeding of snakes in the area will help the farmers as they eat rodents which spoil the crops. They have entered human territories because of the lockdown and absence of much human movement due to it. Even leopard families have been spotted several times in Terai region during lockdown period.” 

Meanwhile, city-based veterinarian Dr Sarpreet Singh Thind said, “Nesting of pythons inside cities is alarming as these reptiles can feed over any living being.”
