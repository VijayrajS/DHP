PORVORIM: Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane on Monday said that the Goa government should issue a public advisory against travel to certain countries, to avoid bringing the coronavirus infection into the state. 

“What action has been taken by the government to prevent a coronavirus epidemic in Goa?” he asked. “We don’t want to die like flies as it happened in China. God knows how many people died,” Rane said.

He said that the health department should take proactive measures against the spread of the infection. “Many people from Goa work overseas; they travel and come back, and so it is important to take steps to prevent the virus from coming into Goa,” Rane said. He asked the CM and the health minister about the steps the government has taken in the matter.
