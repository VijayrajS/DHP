CHENNAI: Country’s third largest two and three wheeler maker, TVS Motor on Monday said that its vehicle production for February would be 10% lower due to Corona virus outbreak in China.


There is a supply chain disruption caused due to the outbreak of Corona virus as parts suppliers in China are either shut or have fewer workmen reporting for work.

At TVS Motor Company, the outbreak of pandemic Coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to impact on supply of certain components for production of BS-VI vehicles. 

China is a key part of the global automobile supply chain.

To minimise the impact on production of BS-VI vehicles, we are consistently monitoring developments with those of our suppliers who are sourcing certain components from China. Parallelly, we are also exploring suppliers in other regions and are looking to localise within India,” he said.
