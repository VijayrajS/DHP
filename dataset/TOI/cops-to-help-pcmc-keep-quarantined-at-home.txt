Cops to help PCMC keep quarantined at home
2020-03-20
Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will seek the help of police as well as home guards to ensure that people advised home quarantine for 14 days do not venture out in the public.

Sharing this information at a press conference on Thursday, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar also appealed to private firms in PCMC limits to extend help to the civic body via corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to check the spread of Covid-19.

The civic chief said the condition of the 11 positive patients in isolation was stable. “Nine of them are asymptomatic, while two have minor symptoms,” Hardikar said. 

He said the number of people under surveillance or home quarantine rose to 299 on Thursday from 230 the previous day. “It is necessary for these people to stay at home for the entire 14-day period. The civic body has formed 100 field surveillance teams with 240 civic employees to ensure that home-quarantined people stay at home. We are also taking the help of 60 police personnel for this purpose. We have sought home guards from the state government to help these teams,” the municipal commissioner said.

He said the civic body had covered 22,000 households under its door-to-door survey in the buffer areas of the spots. “We are advising people suffering from cold or cough to seek doctor’s advice,” Hardikar said.

When contacted, deputy commissioner of police Sudhir Hiremath said, “We have formed 20 teams, including officers from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. These teams will visit residences of those home quarantined. Police will warn them of strict action if they are found roaming in their societies. The quarantined people must ensure that they stay at home. We have the list of home quarantined people.”
