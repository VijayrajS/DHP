MEERUT: A Mumbai man, who was recently shifted to a temporary jail in Saharanpur after he completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine, has now tested positive for Covid-19.


According to sources, the man, who had attended the mid-March Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi, was shifted to the temporary jail along with 60 others recently as they had completed the quarantine period and tested negative. 

Saharanpur superintendent of police (city) Vineet Bhatnagar said, “Some Jamaatis who had tested negative and completed the mandatory 14 days in quarantine were shifted to a temporary jail on Tuesday. However, one of them subsequently tested positive. His sample had come negative in the test conducted on April 4.”

With an inmate testing positive even after the quarantine period, authorities are now mulling sample collection of the other 60 too.

The SP added, “With the help of health officials, he has been shifted to a separate medical facility. The entire jail premises is being sanitised and the process of fresh sampling of the others lodged there has been initiated.”
