Ranchi spooked by bird flu fears amid Covid scare
2020-04-03
Ranchi: While the Jharkhand government machinery grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, bird flu may have affected several villages adjoining the state zoo on the outskirts of Ranchi.

The district animal husbandry department has put several villages on Ormanjhi block, some 20km from Ranchi, under its lens after 10 birds died of bird flu in the neighbouring Birsa Biological Park in the last week of February.

On February 23, two garuds (a rare species of bird), three owls and two white ibis were found dead in the park’s aviary section. Two days later, two more owls and one ‘garud’ died. All of them showed symptoms of avian influenza. The samples were sent to Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases for tests and on March 16, all samples tested positive for avian influenza.

Following the test reports, a quick response team of the department went into an overdrive and its doctors and experts fanned out in 10 villages around the 259-acre zoo to collect samples from poultry and other avian species. The sample collection exercise was held between March 17 and 19. While the first batches of samples were sent to Bhopal for tests, others were held back as transportation came to a complete halt in Jharkhand since March 22 due to the Covid-19 lockdown. However, no further avian deaths have been reported from the zoo or the adjoining hamlets, so far. 

Ajay Kumar, the zoo vet, said, “Following the deaths, the zoo aviary was emptied and sanitized. So far, no fresh case has been reported.”
