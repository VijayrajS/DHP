2020-03-12
Vadodara: Barodians came out in thousands in different areas to play colours on Tuesday despite the coronavirus scare. The roads, especially in old city, were crowded with citizens who were seen playing in groups with their friends and relatives. “We were bit sceptical in morning but later decided to visit our friends and family to play Dhuleti. There seemed to be no scare of Coronavirus as people gathered in big numbers and were playing with colours,” said Rashmin Jadhav, who works as financial advisor. Students of M S University too came out on the road and enjoyed Dhuleti as the authorities had banned gathering campus due to coronavirus. When some students at Faculty of Family and Community Sciences tried to play with colours in the campus, the authorities confiscated the colour. While some Barodians preferred to play with organic colours, some even used rose petals to celebrate Dhuleti.Police department hadn’t issued any guidelines for large gatherings during Dhuleti but the cops did organize awareness campaign on Tuesday asking people to avoid big groups or touching each other.
