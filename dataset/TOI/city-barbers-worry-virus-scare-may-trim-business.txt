City barbers worry virus scare may trim business
2020-04-26
Ranchi: Salons across the city plan safety measures for the post-lockdown period, fearing that their customers may stay away due to contamination scare. However, while the big names have already come up with expensive ideas, the smaller ones fear loss of business.

Ugesh Thakur, owner of Asian Men’s Salon in Bariatu, said, “If salons are allowed to open, we may get customers, but in very less numbers as they will be scared of contracting the coronavirus.” He added, “As a preventive measure, I am planning to offer masks and sanitizers, but anything beyond this will not be possible for me as I have already suffered huge losses.”

At smaller salons, social distancing might be problematic, leading to loss of business, fear barbers. Manoj Kumar, a barber in Kusai Colony, said, “I have a small shop and maintaining social distancing is not possible. I fear that I will lose my customers.” Kumar, however, will wait to see the trend for a few days after the lockdown is lifted before shifting to some other business.

Meanwhile, big salons are ready with expensive plans and are waiting for the lockdown to end. Udit Narayan, owner of Calvin and Hobbes, said, “The scare of the infection is bound to keep customers away from our shops and thus, we have planned to procure PPE kits for our staff and ensure sanitization of chairs and all other equipment after every use.”
