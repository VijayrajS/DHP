Trader gets new heart; home care amid pandemic a challenge
2020-04-21
Kolkata: When the entire world is busy tackling Covid-19, a group of doctors at Medica Superspecialty Hospital was quietly focusing on a patient so that the 45-year-old could go back home with a new heart. 

Amit Kumar Dey of Nadia’s Debagram got lucky just a few days before the nationwide lockdown began. Deys’s family rushed to the hospital on getting a call about the prospect of heart transplant as a matching organ was allocated to the hospital. The small-time trader had been suffering from an end-stage heart failure.

On March 18, an organ retrieval team from Medica flew to Patna to retrieve the heart from Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, where the donor had died after ROTTO allocated it. The heart was flown in and was transplanted on the same day.

“The transplant surgery was only a part of the challenge. The patient had to be on constant supply of medications post transplant, which had posed a challenge on the face of the lockdown that followed. But with meticulous planning and support from all stakeholders, we overcame that difficulty,” said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar, who led his transplant team with doctors Sandip Sardar, Arpan Chakraborty, Dipanjan Chatterjee and Soumyajit Ghosh.

Doctors said the patient had an uneventful recovery. The transplant team has also been training the patient’s family members on how to take care of his nutrition, hygiene at home, specially when a pandemic is around. Dey will be heading for his home on Tuesday.

This was Medica’s maiden heart transplant. Last year, the city had seen at least 8 heart transplants when the number of deceased organ donations went up in the state. This year, there has been at least two donations. But with the healthcare system focussing more on Covid-19 crisis, people involved in organ donation movement expect less donations this year.
