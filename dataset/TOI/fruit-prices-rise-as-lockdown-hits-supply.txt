Fruit prices rise as lockdown hits supply in Madurai
2020-04-02
MADURAI: As the lockdown has affected the supply of fruits to Madurai city, the residents have requested that fruits should be made accessible like vegetables and meat.


Banana shops are totally absent in the main streets. “I have not ventured out for the past one week, and have not been able to buy any fruit,” said Sundaram of K K Nagar. He says that he used to have a banana a day after dinner. Many like him say that vegetables are available in the local grocery stores in almost every street, but not fruits. “Now it is difficult to get a banana for my five-year-old daughter,” said Kalaivani of Vilangudi.

Madurai Fruit Vendors Association president B Suresh said that out of the 240 shops in the city, only about 10 to 20 were functioning now, and the supplies had also dipped sharply resulting in the shortage. “Guava, oranges and pomegranates, which usually come from the northern states are not coming. Only Kashmir apples are coming in air conditioned containers,” he said.

The fruit market usually opens at 10pm and closes by 5am, after which retailers take the fruit out. But, now due to the restriction in timings, vendors told to close shops by 9am. He said that there had not been many retailers coming forward to sell fruit on Tuesday.

What is available now is watermelon, which is coming from Vandavasi. Banana supplies have dipped. Grapes including panneer grapes and the seedless varieties are coming from the neighbouring districts. The fruit vendors had made a representation to Theni district collector Pallavi M Baldev to allow enough supply of fruits to Madurai.

Meanwhile, the prices of fruits have also gone up due to the poor supply. A bunch of any kind of banana is sold for not less than Rs 100. Panneer grapes touched Rs 40 in wholesale and Rs 80 at some retail shops. Seedless grapes are sold for Rs 100/kg. Mobile fruit markets would be a big boon at least in select locations, say residents.
