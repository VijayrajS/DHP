2020-06-12
AHMEDABAD: Gujarat has the third highest Covid test positivity rate in the country with 8.09 positive cases per 100 tests as on June 10. The state is only better than Delhi, which is at 9.58, while Maharashtra had the country’s highest test positivity rate of 13.7%, as on May 31. Despite these high test positivity rates, Gujarat lags behind in contact tracing, being the third worst in the country and way behind states like Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Goa. 


In contact tracing, while Goa conducts 258 tests for every Covid-19 positive case, Bihar conducts 20 tests per case, but Gujarat conducts 13. This is the third lowest figure in the country. Maharashtra is the lowest with 7 tests for every positive case. Several northeastern states are way ahead in contact tracing. 




“It is observed that states which have better contact tracing have lower Covid positivity rates. States like Kerala also have dispersed housing, unlike the congested localities of Ahmedabad or Mumbai, where isolating Covid-19 patients or containing the disease becomes a challenge. A difference can be seen between Covid spread in villages of Ahmedabad district and that of the city. There are other reasons also which are a matter of scientific investigation,” says a senior health official.

Recently, scientists at ICMR-National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH), Ahmedabad, were first to report on how a person with high viral load spread the infection at a rate almost eight times higher that of one with a low viral. NIOH, Ahmedabad had studied samples from about 2,000 individuals of whom 140 were Covid-19 patients. 

The Covid test positive rates for Gujarat had been hovering between 3.9% and 4.9% between April 10 and April 15, after which by May 8 it had gone beyond 7% and by June 10 it went up to 8.09%, after the lockdown was eased on May 31. Meanwhile, contact tracing records for Gujarat has been hovering between 13 and 14 per case till the last week of May and then dipping to 12 tests per Covid patient by June 10, despite the high number of cases.
