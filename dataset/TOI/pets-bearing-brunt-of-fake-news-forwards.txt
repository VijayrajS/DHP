Covid-19 pandemic: Pets bearing brunt of fake news forwards
2020-03-22
HYDERABAD: While coronavirus is spreading across the globe, fake news and misconceptions are spreading even faster. One such news is that of dogs and other domestic animals being carriers of this virus. In recent days, the state has seen a spike in abandonment of pets over such misconceptions. Animal activists said that in many cases, healthy dogs are being left on the streets by their owners.



“I have been receiving 10 to 15 calls a day from people willing to give up their dogs. When I ask them why do they want to do so, some say they are scared they might get infected,” said Pravallika N, founder of Compassionate Society for Animals (CSA).


 

Despite the World Health Organisation (WHO) denying rumours of dogs being carriers of the virus, many have been rushing to veterinary clinics to get their pets vaccinated. Veterinarians, at both private and government clinics, have been receiving an increasing number of calls for vaccination. “It is important to understand that coronavirus in dogs and novel coronavirus (Covid-19) are completely different. We are counselling people who are enquiring about the vaccine but still many insist on getting their pets vaccinated with the coronavirus injection,” said Dr M Nivedita who works for Blue Cross and also runs a private clinic. 

Coronavirus in dogs causes mild gastroenteritis along with diarrhoea and usually happens to older dogs while the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a respiratory disease which spreads only through human transmission. When asked about the crisis, GHMC chief veterinary officer Dr Abdul Vakil said: “It is illegal to abandon pets. We have already spread word among doctors and volunteers to explain and spread awareness about the fact that Covid-19 doesn’t spread from dogs and the coronavirus vaccine for dogs is optional.” He also added that strict action will be taken against those who abandon their pets.
