VISAKHAPATNAM: A man who arrived in Visakhapatnam from Dubai via Hyderabad in an Air India flight was stopped at the airport and is being quarantined at Chest and Communicable Diseases Hospitals after doctors observed that he was suffering from cold and cough.

Officials informed that the man hails from Jalluputtunga village in Samputa mandal in Srikakulam district. He was living in Dubai and works at a saw mill. He was on his way home on vacation.

An airport official said that apart from having cough and cold, the passenger also suffers from a chronic ailment, which is why the doctors decided against taking a risk and quarantined him. “He was shifted to the hospital directly from the airport,” the official added.

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in late January, nearly 5,000 passengers arriving in the city from other countries have been screened at Visakhapatnam airport.

“Doctors at the airport have sent three passengers to quarantine since then. On Wednesday, two of three members of a family who had arrived in the city from Kuala Lumpur were quarantined,” the official further informed. Their reports came in on Saturday and both of them have tested negative for Covid-19 and have been released from the hospital.
