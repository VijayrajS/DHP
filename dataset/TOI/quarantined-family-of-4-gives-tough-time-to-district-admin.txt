NASHIK: A family of four who have returned from Australia and advised home quarantine started frequenting between their Nashik city residence and parents’ home in Khambale village of Igatpuri taluka, leaving the authorities in a tizzy.


The family has finally been given strict instructions to stay self-quarantined at their residence in Nashik city, said officials of the district health department. 

“None of the family members is suffering from any illness, but all of them are under strict watch because of rising number of coronavirus cases in the state.” 

According to health officials, the man, aged 36, his wife and children aged eight years and one year returned from Australia on March 11. After spending a few days in a hotel and at their residence in Nashik, they went to their parents house in Khambale village on March 17. 

“Soon after the health department got information about the travel history of the family, they rushed to their residence in Khambale on March 18 and asked the family to remain confined to their house,” said the officials.

“However, on the same day in the afternoon, they returned to their residence in Pathardi Phata. After that, they once against went to Khambale on March 19.”

Given the frequent travelling of the family from Khambale to Pathardi Phata, the district administration decided to keep them in isolation. An ambulance was rushed to Khambale to pick them. 

District collector Suraj Mandhare said the family has been warned of strict action if they are found leaving their house in the city again. 

He has appealed to people to dial 104 and 100 and alert the officials if people with travel history are found mingling in crowds or moving about freely.
