AGRA: After central jail, Novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has now reached Agra district jail. A 90-year-old prisoner, who died during treatment at SN Medical College (SNMC) with Covid-19 symptoms on May 13, has been found to be infected with the virus on Friday. So far, there were 27 Covid-19 deaths in Agra district. 


As a precaution to prevent the further spread of the virus inside the prison, 28 inmates who had come in contact with the infected prisoner were quarantined in a separate block, while six staffers were home quarantined. A team from Agra municipal corporation conducted sanitisation of the jail premises. 

Agra district jail superintendent Shashikant Mishra said, “The person was under treatment at the jail hospital since May 3. He was suffering from loose motions, vomiting and weakness. He was shifted to SNMC on May 13. Later, he died during treatment. After his death, samples were collected for Covid-19 testing in which he was found positive." 

“A health department team has conducted screening of all the prisoners and staffers who had come in his contact. In the first phase, samples of six prisoners and three staffers are being sent for lab testing," he said. 

Last week, a 60-year-old Covid-19 infected prisoner of Agra Central Jail had died at SNMC. So far, 10 prisoners of the central jail have been tested positive. 

Meanwhile, nine new Covid-19 cases surfaced in Agra, taking the district tally to 794.
