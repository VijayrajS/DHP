2020-04-04
BENGALURU: With distrust derailing the testing and quarantining of those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday reached out to Muslim leaders and legislators to dispel fear and rumours and bring back on track the state’s fight against Covid-19.


On a day many Tabligh delegates tested positive in Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra and other states, Yediyurappa urged the leaders to take urgent confidence-building measures with the community and help the government trace all delegates and their contacts.




A 75-year-old man died in Bagalkot on Friday hours after he was confirmed positive, taking the state’s toll to four. A kirana merchant by profession, he had been kept in isolation in the district hospital and was being treated for symptoms, DC K Rajendra said. He is the first patient from the district; with Bagalkot, 15 of the state’s 30 districts have come under the corona cloud.


Assaults on health workers: CM calls for more awareness

Authorities in Bagalkot said the victim had not travelled anywhere recently. His son and daughter had arrived from Bengaluru 10 days ago and they have tested negative. Test reports of another family member are awaited.


Three test positive

Earlier in the day, three Tabligh delegates from Belagavi district tested positive for the infection. Along with the Bagalkot victim, they were the only Covid-19 cases to be reported in the state in 24 hours.

The Centre had sent the state a list of 1,500 people linked to the congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz, which has since emerged as a super-spreader of the virus, triggering cluster infections in several states. With increasing incidents of assault of healthcare workers and resistance to testing and quarantine being reported, Yediyurappa said there was a need to create awareness.

“We sought the help of community leaders to help us identify and trace those who attended the Nizamuddin Jamaat meeting,” Yediyurappa said.

Among those present at the meeting were Congress MLAs Zameer Ahmed Khan, NA Haris and Rizwan Arshad; party MLCs CM Ibrahim and Nazir Ahmed and KPCC working president Salim Ahmed. Pledging support to the state’s fight against the pandemic, the leaders assured the CM that they would hold meetings with religious leaders and stress on testing as a means to contain the outbreak.
