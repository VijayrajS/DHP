MLAs made respondents in lockdown violation PIL
2020-05-13
Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday allowed petitioners to include public representatives who violated lockdown norms as respondents in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition seeking directions to the state government to take action against lawmakers for either holding meetings or participating in public gatherings during the lockdown period.

Para Kishore, an advocate, moved the HC with a PIL pointing out violations by the MLAs during the lockdown. He argued in his petition that lawmakers, who should educate people, are violating the norms.

He included five MLAs as respondents in the petition along with the state government and the police department. The HC had earlier issued notices to respondents and asked the state government and director general of police to file action taken report.

On Tuesday, advocate for petitioner Karumanchi Indraneel Babu told the HC that even after high court notices, many lawmakers were violating lockdown norms. Upon hearing both sides, the HC allowed petitioners to include lawmakers who violated lockdown norms as respondents in the petition. The HC posted further hearing of the case to next Tuesday. TNN
