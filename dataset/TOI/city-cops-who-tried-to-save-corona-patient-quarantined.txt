Vijayawada: Two cops who put their lives at risk by transporting a 55-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid-19 to Vijayawada GGH were put under quarantine on Wednesday. 

According to police, the incident happened early in the morning on April 20 when the 55-year-old woman who wasnâ€™t well was first taken to Global Hospital by her family. Later, hospital authorities advised them to take her to old GGH as they did not have outpatient services. Since there were no vehicles, a sub-inspector and a cyber expert working at the DISHA police station took her along with her husband to the GGH in on their vehicle. 

Eventually, the woman was again sent to Vijayawada GGH, where they were told that they treat only Covid-19 patients. On advise of the hospital authorities, the woman was then taken to ESI hospital, where she was declared brought dead. Upon conducting tests, on April 21, it was learnt that she was Covid-19 positive. 

During the course of contact tracing, it was learnt that both the SI and the cyber expert happen to have transported them. Eventually, they were kept under quarantine as a precautionary measure. Both of them are being tested for Covid-19. The police commissioner applauded both of them.
