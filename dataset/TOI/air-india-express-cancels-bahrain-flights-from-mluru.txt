“Flights to/from Bahrain have been withdrawn as Bahrain Civil Aviation Authority permits only a single Air India Express flight per day.”

Meanwhile, in a letter to the airport director, MIA, AIE stated: “This is to inform you that Air India Express flight withdrawn due to Covid-19 notification issued for the suspension of travel.”

However, Bahrain has not officially restricted arrivals from India. 

“This is totally unacceptable, the AIE should at least operate one flight from MIA instead of restricting all. So far there is no travel restriction to Bahrain,” said Vincent who moved to Bahrain two decades ago. 

“My son was to fly to Bahrain from MIA on Wednesday but flight stands cancelled now. The AIE in its communiqué stated that flights are operational from airports in Kerala. On an average 60-70 passengers travel to Bahrain from MIA in each flight. Why can’t AIE operate one flight in a week to accommodate all those expats,” he questioned. 

Bahrain has over one lakh expats from undivided Dakshina Kannada.

Sources from corporate communications, AIE told TOI that flight may have been grounded due to load factor.
