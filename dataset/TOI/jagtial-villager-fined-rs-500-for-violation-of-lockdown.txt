Hyderabad:Itikyala gram panchayat in Jagtial district of Telangana has found a novel way to stop villagers from violating the lockdown.

The panchayat secretary imposed a fine of 500 on villager Mittametla Raja Reddy on Monday for coming out of his house. In a receipt that was issued to Reddy, it was said the fine was imposed for roaming around three times in a day. The fine has been listed under ‘others’ in the fines list.

Meanwhile, in Siddipet, local legislator and finance minister T Harish Rao patrolled the local areas and got several two-wheelers seized by police. The minister questioned bikers as to why they were moving around during the lockdown. On receiving unsatisfactory replies, the minister ordered that the vehicles be seized and returned after the lockdown period ends.

Harish distributed provisions worth Rs 1,250 to 700 auto drivers and asked shop owners to provide hand sanitisers and soaps to customers.
