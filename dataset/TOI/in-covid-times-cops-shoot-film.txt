2020-04-01
AHMEDABAD: When the coronavirus pandemic has gripped the world, city police cops seem to be busy capturing how they deal with people to show to cops of all the other police stations of Ahmedabad city.

Some 50 cops, including a PSI, a PI and two ACPs were stationed in Laldarwaja in front of the Sidi Saiyyad Mosque with four cameras set up. Constables were stopping people, most of whom were involved in providing essential services, and interrogated them about why they were on the road.

The cops also did not miss the chance to issue memos for traffic violation and put people in a queue to question them. When a police officer was asked about this, a person with a DSLR camera intervened and said, “We are shooting for Saheb”. At this, a crime branch ACP, who was present at the spot, cut off the person with the camera and said, “This is a routine procedure.” 

An official of Karanj police said they were shooting for a film to demonstrate to cops how they should work during the coronavirus lockdown. On why a crime branch ACP was present, the official said he also wanted to understand how to work in this situation. 

“We will show this film to every police station to teach cops on how to work during the coronavirus outbreak,” said the official.

The official said as the coronavirus situation is unprecedented, they are filming the standard operating procedure for future reference.
