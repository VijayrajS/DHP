Health department issued a statement reminding that Covid care centres have been established in all districts with a view to accommodate people who have been advised home isolation but have no residence in the state. The idea is to also accommodate persons in home isolation who donâ€™t follow home isolation guidelines. These centres will also accommodate Keralite returning from various states in the country.

It further said that any person with travel history to Covid-19-affected countries or person with contact with such a traveller, whether they are having symptoms or not, must remain in home isolation.
