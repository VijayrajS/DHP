Hubballi: The state government had made it mandatory for everyone coming into the state to be in institutionally quarantined for 14 days, however, the government has relaxed some of these norms.

There have been protests in Bengaluru by people coming in from Delhi and different states in the country, against going into institutional quarantine, and officials are having a hard time in making them comply.

Earlier, everyone, including pregnant women, children, the aged, and people afflicted with chronic diseases had to be institutionally quarantined, if they came into the state. 

Only 2%-3% of the people coming into the state are willing to be quarantined in hotels at their own cost, said sources.

Dr Om Prakash Patil, director, directorate of state health and family welfare services, said that the health and family welfare department has made certain changes pertaining to institutional quarantine norms, and also issued a circular to all the deputy commissioners in this regard, on Thursday. 

The circular stated that on the arrival of people in the state, who are category II asymptomatic, such as pregnant women, children below 10, those above 80, and terminally ill patients, they are exempted from mandatory institutional quarantine, and they can be home quarantined for 14 days, from their date of arrival. 

Bagalkot additional deputy commissioner Mahadev Muragi said that as per the new circular, they are institutionally quarantining everyone coming into the state, except those in category II.
