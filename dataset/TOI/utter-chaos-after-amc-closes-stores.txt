Ahmedabad lockdown: Utter chaos after AMC closes stores
2020-05-07
ahmedabad: A mad scramble for groceries and vegetables erupted minutes after in-charge Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) commissioner Mukesh Kumar issued a notification ordering a shutdown of all stores except those selling milk and medicines from Thursday, till 6am on May 15. 

Crowds swelled outside vegetable and grocery stores in various parts of the city, caring two hoots about social distancing. Panic buyers were seen in the serpentine queues outside stores on Wednesday evening to buy vegetables, fruits and groceries and whatever else they could catch hold of.

As people rushed out of their homes to get essentials, heavy traffic snarls were also seen in several parts of the city. 

“Do we have a choice? I have a family of four to sustain for eight days! A decision comes in around 5pm to shut grocery stores and vegetable vendors from the next day. It’s the start of the month and we don’t have enough supplies to last us through this time,” said Bhargav Sharma, a professional, who rushed out to stock up groceries.

Most people hoarded potatoes and onions, which went off shelves within minutes, according to traders. A number of stores, especially those selling vegetables ran out of supplies and were forced to ask customers to return empty handed. 

“I waited in queue for 25 minutes and by the time I got into the store, there were some mangoes and potatoes. All the vegetables were out of stock. The queues were pretty much the same across all the stores and vendors in the locality,” said Nishtha Shah, a Vejalpur resident.

As social distancing went for a toss amid swelling crowds outside stores in different parts of the city including Stadium Road, Prernatirth Derasar Road, Anandnagar Road and Azad Society, among others, police personnel had to intervene to get people in order.
