Kolkata cops on alert as week 2 of Unlock 1.0 starts today
2020-06-08
KOLKATA: Cops will be on their toes to thoroughly check if social distancing norms are being maintained when malls and religious places reopen on Monday.


According to Lalbazar sources, every police station and traffic guard has formed small teams that will visit all those sectors that open on Monday. They will provide a status report, based on which a response will be generated.

All police stations have been reminded that the lockdown is still in force and that only economic activities were being allowed. “We have been asked to ensure that there is no gathering on roads and that all attempts at joyrides and needless roaming — especially near the micro-containment zones — are nipped in the bud,” a divisional DC said. “We will ensure that people wear masks. There will be naka checkings as well,” he added.

Cops on the ground, though, wondered how much of it will be possible given that relaxations had been offered in nearly every segment and the public was yet to grasp the necessity of social distancing. “On multiple occasions in the past week, we had been challenged on the road and asked to spell out specifics on why people cannot be allowed to sit at a tea stall,” said an officer from a south suburban police station.

Traffic cops said several bus owners had approached them seeking to know if crowded buses would be stopped for raids. “We have told them that our daily checks will continue. Some buses are plying with their doors shut. We have assured all support, but have asked drivers to stop at important stops on Monday as passengers keep rushing to the doors,” another officer said, adding that raids to check autos and unruly bikes, too, have been planned with the transport department.
