Hyderabad: Non-telescopic electricity tariff, three-month cumulative billing and increased power consumption due to the summer heat are the three reasons behind the hefty power bills, pinching pockets of shocked electricity consumers. However, power distribution companies cannot be absolved as erroneous billing and faulty meter reading has resulted in many consumers receiving huge electricity bills. If not redressed, some customers are mulling to drag officials to court.

Enquiries by TOI revealed that non-telescopic tariff slabs and three-month cumulative bill were the main culprits for the bill amounts going up. Also, power consumption was 40-50% more during summer compared to other months. Due to the lockdown, people staying indoors while also working and studying from home resulted in more power being consumed in the months of March, April and May, the bills for which were served in June first week.

The state has been using a non-telescopic tariff plan, approved by Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC), for the past few years. As TSSPDCLgenerated cumulative bill for three months, the total number of units consumed was divided by three (for March, April and May). Generally, consumers of LT category 1-B1 who used to pay Rs 3.30 per unit in March and April due to consumption of below 100 units, found themselves being billed at Rs 4.30 per unit due to increased power consumption in May.

For example, their March and April consumption would e about 90 units and 98 units respectively. However, May power consumption jumped to 150 units. Due to cumulative billing, total consumed units were 338 and billed at Rs 4.30 per unit as per non-telescopic method and not Rs 3.30 per unit up to 100 units and Rs 4.30 for remaining units.
