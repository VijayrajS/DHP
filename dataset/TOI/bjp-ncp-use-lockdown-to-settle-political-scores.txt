2020-05-15
KOLHAPUR: The in-power NCP and the opposition BJP in Solapur district are engaged in settling a political score by exploiting the nationwide lockdown.

Ram Satpute, the BJP MLA from Malshiras, is currently quarantined at home following a complaint by the NCP. The BJP has now demanded that NCPâ€™s Mohol MLA Mohol Vishwanath Mane too be put into home quarantine for violating the lockdown. 

Satpute, was ordered to be in home quarantine last week following a complaint by NCP district general secretary Kiran Sathe. Malshiras block development officer Shama Pawar had ordered Malshiras municipal council to ensure home quarantine of the sitting MLA. BJP sources confirmed that Satpute has been home quarantine for the past few days. 

NCP had complained to the district administration that Satpute had returned to Malshiras from Beed and Pune, which is a red zone. The party also pointed out that Satpute conducted a meeting of the government officials after his return to Malshiras. Pawar had then issued an order to put Satpute in home quarantine.

On Wednesday, BJP workers in neighbouring Mohol taluka submitted a memorandum to block development officer, demanding home quarantine for NCP MLA Vishwanath Mane. Mohol BJP president Satish Kale said in a letter that Mane has entered Solapur district from Pune, which is a red zone. Kale has said that Mane had violated lockdown rules and needs to go for home quarantine as per the rules.

Kale also has alleged that Mane had visited two villages after his arrival from Pune. 

The Mohol BDO has sent the letter to district collector, seeking an order on the BJP letter.
