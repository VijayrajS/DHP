Sanofi ties up with US for virus vaccine
2020-02-20
Mumbai: Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines business unit of Sanofi, will leverage previous development work for a SARS vaccine to fast-track development of a Covid-19 vaccine. The company will collaborate with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, at the US department of health. 

Covid-19 belongs to a family of coronaviruses that can cause respiratory disease. 

In 2002, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus emerged and then disappeared by 2004. Sanofi plans to investigate an advanced pre-clinical SARS vaccine candidate that could protect against Covid-19. “Addressing a global health threat such as this coronavirus is going to take a collaborative effort, which is why we are working with BARDA to quickly advance a potential vaccine candidate,” said David Loew, global head of vaccines at Sanofi. “While we are lending our expertise where possible, we believe the collaboration with BARDA may provide the most meaningful results in protecting the public from this latest outbreak.” The company will use its recombinant DNA platform to produce a vaccine candidate. agencies The recombinant technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus. The DNA sequence encoding this antigen will be combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi’s licensed recombinant influenza product, and used to rapidly produce large quantities of the coronavirus antigen which will be formulated to stimulate the immune system to protect against the virus.

Earlier it had entered into an agreement with HHS to increase the company’s pandemic influenza vaccine production, capabilities based in Pennsylvania.
