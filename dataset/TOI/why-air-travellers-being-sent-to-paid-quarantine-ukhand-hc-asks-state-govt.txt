2020-06-04
NAINITAL: Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state government as well as civil aviation secretary and the district magistrate of Dehradun to explain why people coming to the state via the air route are being sent to paid quarantine into hotels.

The directions from the bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe came while it was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging that many people travelling to the state through air are being asked to quarantine themselves in hotels. Dehradun resident Umesh Kumar, who is also the petitioner in the case, alleged that the people in quarantine are asked to pay for everything, including food at these centres.

Though the court’s written order wasn’t available till the time of filing of this report, Gopal Verma, the counsel appearing for the petitioner told TOI that the court has asked the respondents to explain why, when people travelling by car or trains are being sent to institutional quarantine centres or being asked to quarantine themselves in their own homes, people travelling by air are being sent to paid quarantine centres. "We informed the court that the government has established 36 of these quarantine centres in areas such as Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar where air travellers are being sent, while no person travelling by car or train is being sent to these paid quarantine facilities," he said.

He added that there are many air passengers who have somehow arranged money from their friends and relatives to take flights to Dehradun but as soon as they reach the airport, they are being sent to 7-14 days of paid quarantine. “Many of them cannot afford to spend so much on paid quarantine facilities,” the counsel said.

The court has given the state and other respondent time till Thursday to respond to the allegations.
