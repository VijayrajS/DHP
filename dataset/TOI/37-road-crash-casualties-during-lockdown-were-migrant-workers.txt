2020-05-19
LUCKNOW: Home-bound migrant workers lost their life in 37% of the total road traffic accidents (RTA) that took place during the period of lockdown—from March 24 to May 18.

This assessment, undertaken by Road Safety Network, a national coalition of organisations promoting safe roads, also showed that 7% of the accident victims were corona warriors deputed on Covid duties.



The researchers noted that a total of 1,236 crashes took place during the lockdown. The incidents led to 423 deaths and 833 injures. Of these, 158 deceased and 607 injured were migrants workers. Accidents also took lives of 29 essential workers and left 26 injured. The remaining 236 deaths and 200 injured were placed in the ‘others’ category. 

State-wise, 56.7% (or 138) of these crash deaths took place in Uttar Pradesh. The number included 51 migrant workers and 10 essential workers. 

Madhya Pradesh followed next with 44 deaths. Telangana, Punjab and Maharashtra secured the third, fourth and fifth positions with 35, 23 and 21 crash deaths respectively.

Speaking on behalf of the network, founder of SaveLife Foundation Piyush Tewari said: “The information for the analysis was gathered from secondary sources, particularly media reports. It was verified with district police, ambulance service providers and traffic department.”

Referring to the incidents in Auraiyya, Unnao and Kushinagar, Tewari said: “State governments can increase highway patrolling while agencies like NHAI and other agencies’ inspecting vehicles should keep an eye on speeding, especially by commercial vehicles, to avoid accidents.”

The network also recommends police check barriers on highways to reduce speeding. Barriers can be placed after every 20km or near roads with risky terrain.
