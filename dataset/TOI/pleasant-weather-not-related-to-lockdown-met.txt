Pleasant weather not related to lockdown: MeT
2020-05-03
RANCHI: The weather department on Saturday discarded a popular theory that the state is witnessing a change in the weather pattern, unusual for April and May, due to a drop in air pollutants after the lockdown.

Director of India Meteorological Department, Ranchi, S D Kotal, said, “It has nothing to do with the lockdown. We are witnessing a comparatively lower temperature and a pleasant weather condition because of frequent thunderstorms in Jharkhand and neighbouring states like Chhattisgarh and Bihar.”

Predicting a pleasant weather for the week to come, Kotal added, “The weather will remain pleasant in the coming week and light rain, thundershowers are expected in many parts of the state.”

“The weather this year has been quite rainy in April and May due to frequent localised thunderstorms. The weather condition can be attributed to a cyclonic circulation and eastward movement of a trough. People may feel colder in the later hours of the day because of the rain.”

The MeT department had earlier said that this year, summer would be hotter and the average temperature may witness a surge by 1-1.5 degrees Celsius. However, on Saturday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 35.4°C in Daltonganj, while the minimum was around 18.3°C at Kanke.
