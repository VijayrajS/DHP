Stop forcing shipping firms to pay for quarantine: GFP
2020-04-30
PANAJI: Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Wednesday said the state government should expedite efforts to bring back Goan seafarers and NRIs stranded abroad. It said the government should not “arm twist” shipping companies and cruise line firms to pay for quarantining the seafarers.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai said, “We would be glad if the seafarer companies can afford and willing to pay the reasonable charges, but to demand that the seafarer companies pay for the quarantine of their repatriated crew as per the quarantine measures laid down by the state and adopting an attitude of pay or be damned is like holding a gun to their head – in other words, an extortion.” 

The International Labour Organisation said that under Regulation 2.5 of the Marine Labour Convention, 2006, seafarers have a right to be repatriated at no cost to themselves in the circumstances and under the conditions specified in the Code. The ILO’s Covid-19 guidelines for member states, which includes India, also state that members must permit the entry of seafarers holding a valid seafarers’ identity document supplemented by a passport, when entry is requested for the purpose of: (a) joining their ship or transferring to another ship; (b) passing in transit to join their ship in another country or for repatriation. 

GFP, which remains part of the NDA alliance, said that the government’s stance could jeopardise future job prospects for the Goan seafarers.

Sardesai pointed out that many companies have taken care of the crew members for nearly two months and that most of the cruise liners are now on the verge of collapse due to the economic slump.

The party said that the state government should simultaneously draw up detailed repatriation plans for Goan seamen stuck on foreign shores and for the hundreds of Goan origin NRIs who are stuck in other parts of the world.

“While expressing our joy at the return of our seafarers from Marella Discovery, we also wish to express our disappointment at the way the whole operation was handled,” said Sardesai.
