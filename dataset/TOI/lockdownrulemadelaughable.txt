Lockdown rule made laughable
2020-04-12
There is a Ration shop in Shivaji Chowk, Malad East. Everyday the crowd gathers with a 100 meter queue starting from morning 7:00 am with around more than 100 people not following the lockdown rule. Residents around have to call the police to handle them and still the Ration licence holder is not able to manage the crowd and also unable to meet the demand of the required ration.
