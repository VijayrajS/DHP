Women in south Rajasthan counter rumours on Covid
2020-05-28
JAIPUR: To make people aware about the real symptoms of coronavirus and its prevention, a women’s organisation in Southern Rajasthan ‘Ujala Samooh’ has started a door-to-door campaign. 

When Covid-19 spread in the country, rumours started spreading in rural areas of southern districts that the government would shot dead the migrants or the government will take away excess ration from people’s houses. On the advice of priests, women started fasting for six continuous days to save their families from the impact of the virus.

Ujala Samooh is a women solidarity group active at six blocks in Rajsamand, Udaipur, Banswara and Dungarpur districts. The objective of the group is to protect rights of women in the region, but with the spread of the virus, they started a campaign to generate awareness about the pandemic. The group, which was launched a decade ago by Ajeevika Bureau in Udaipur district, now consists of 13,000 women members.

Manju Rajput, an executive of the group said, “There were many rumours spreading in villages about coronavirus. Someone said it spreads through dogbite while others said police will kill migrants to prevent its spread. We started visiting people’s households to make them aware about the way virus was spreading and its prevention.” 

Hundreds of women in the region started fasting for 5 – 6 days continuously believing that was the only way to save their family from coronavirus. 

Prema Dhruve, a volunteer of Ujala Samhooh working in Salumbar bock in Udaipur, said it was always women who had been asked to fast.
