2020-04-27
Gorakhpur: A three-month-old baby who had tested positive for coronavirus around two weeks ago, was cured and discharged along with her mother who had been looking after him, on Sunday from BRD Medical College. The baby happens to be a relative of Basti’s first Covid death case.

The mother-son duo received a standing ovation from Gorakhpur DM Vijyendra Pandiyan, commissioner Jayant Narlirkar, BRD college principal Ganesh Kumar and other officials for winning the fight against the virus.

On April 12, the mother (30) had arrived with her son to BRD Medical College and both were tested twice. The mother was found to be negative but the baby was positive. 

“The major challenge for the doctors was to save mother from the infection. The infant was shifted to the isolation ward, where his mother took care of him with all precautions,” said the BRD college principal.

“The baby had no serious complications except fever for which he was initially given paracetamol. He recovered without any medication due to self-immunity boosted by the intake of mother’s milk,” the principal added. 

The tests conducted on Saturday and Sunday of both mother and baby were negative.
