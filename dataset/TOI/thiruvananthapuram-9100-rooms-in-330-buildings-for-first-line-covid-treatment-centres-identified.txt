THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation completed the list of Covid first line treatment centres and mayor K Sreekumar handed over the same to minister for tourism and devaswom, Kadakampally Surendran here on Wednesday. Total 9,100 rooms in 330 buildings have been set up for first line treatment centres. Fifty-five of these are government buildings and rest 275 are private buildings.
 

The list includes 23 auditoriums, 125 educational institutions, 79 hotels, 34 lodges, 14 flats and 22 halls have been identified for the treatment centres. Of these, 3,793 rooms have a bathroom attached. The city corporation has been running seven centres as Covid care homes; Samethi hall, training centre at Manvila, Women's College Vazhuthacaud, IMG hall, University College hostel, Mar Ivanios College and Vizhinjam St Mary's. 

The health department has stressed the need to identify centres as CFLTC considering a situation where more number of primary contacts are turning positive and more number of patients will have to be admitted.

The centre identified as CFLTC will treat all mild and moderate symptomatic persons under surveillance and will be utilised for treating positive cases, when need arises. The idea is to use these places as primary level health care centres which will tend to less serious cases and referral of serious cases to Covid hospitals to avoid crowding directly in the Covid hospital and wastage of resources, as per the guidelines issued by state health department.
