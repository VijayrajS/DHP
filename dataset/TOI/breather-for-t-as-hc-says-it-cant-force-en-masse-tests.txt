Breather for Telangana as HC says it can't force to conduct Covid tests
2020-05-15
HYDERABAD: Days after cornering the government on fewer Covid-19 tests, the Telangana HC on Thursday gave relief to the state, expressing its reluctance to force the government to conduct tests in a massive way and test even those with no symptoms at all.

Stating that it would be a huge financial burden on the state, a bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman said forcing people to undergo tests without consent would be a direct infringement on their rights. Hearing a PIL filed by S Varun of Suryapet who wanted HC to direct government to conduct massive tests in red and orange zones, the bench said it would be better to ask the state to allow those who can afford Rs 4,500 per test to get themselves tested at any of the 12 private labs approved by ICMR. “Nothing is finalised,” said the bench which had reserved its judment in similar case. HC issued notices to the state and Centre, sought counters and posted the case to May 18.

Gorantla Pujitha, petitioner’s counsel, said as people with no symptoms were also testing positive, it would be better to ask the government to do tests on all in red and orange zones. The bench said the government was doing tests free of cost. “Centre is supplying imported test kits, the number of which is limited. Finances are a huge problem. Moreover, this is a technical issue to be decided by ICMR experts,” HC added.

“Government cannot force people to undergo tests. If they catch hold of a normal person, it creates panic in localities,” the bench said. Advocate General BS Prasad said ICMR guidelines also did not specify that tests be done on people who show no symptoms.

On another PIL by professor PL Vishweshwar Rao of TJS who wanted state to conduct tests on bodies, HC sought counters from state and Centre. “Let the state follow ICMR guidelines,” the bench said. Prasad said ICMR guidelines did not specify tests on bodies.
