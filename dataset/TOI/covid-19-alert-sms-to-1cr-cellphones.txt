2020-04-08
Pune: The city police have sent one crore text messages to people who either visited the slum pockets in Gultekdi, where two persons were found Covid-19 positive or passed through the area or were in touch with the local residents over the phone, alerting them about the symptoms of the disease and urging them to seek medical help if they have any of those symptoms.

Police traced the SIM cards which were found active in the area in the last 20 days and drew up a list of cellphone numbers.

 Last week, the Pune city police’s cybercrime unit undertook a task of identifying people who visited the Meenatai Thackarey Vasahat and adjoining slum pockets in Gultekdi. 

Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam said, “Some of these numbers are of locals, while others are from different parts of the city.".
