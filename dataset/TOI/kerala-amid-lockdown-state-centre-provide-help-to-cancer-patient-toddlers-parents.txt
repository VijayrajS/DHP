ALAPPUZHA: When social media and all the political parties have joined their hands together, the state government has come forward to send one-and-half year-old Anvitha with her parents from Cherthala to Hyderabad for cancer treatment.

 Vineeth Vijayan and Gopika, residing in Cherthala municipality, needed to take their child Anvitha, suffering from retinoblastoma (a cancer that starts in the retina), to L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad on April 7 for her treatment. 

But the unexpected lockdown created roadblock for her treatment and her patents didnâ€™t have any idea how they could take their child to the hospital. Following it, her father, made a post in social media explaining their plight. After seeing the post, the state government and politicians like Oommen Chnady, union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan and media persons have come forward for helping Anvitha and her family.
