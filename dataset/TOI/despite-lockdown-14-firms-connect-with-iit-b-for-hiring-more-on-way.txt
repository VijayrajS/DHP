2020-05-02
MUMBAI: Around 14 companies have shown interest in recruiting IIT-Bombay graduates amid the Covid-19 lockdown. More companies are expected to participate in the placement process in the coming days and weeks. 


The elite institute has resumed its second phase of recruitment even as students are anxious about job confirmation and withdrawal of offers in the current scenario. 

Several institutes in the city are taking efforts to ensure placements are not jeopardized. So far, at IIT-B, only five offers from one company have been revoked. These students will be allowed to participate in the ongoing online process, said an official from the placement cell. 

Every year, the placement season at IIT-B attracts over 300 companies. 

Interviews are being conducted on Skype and on phones. A majority of these companies are from research, IT, consulting and education sectors. Courseleap, Metal Power, Matdun Corp and Institute of Advanced Sciences are some of the companies that have begun to hire IIT-B talent.

The second phase of recruitment at IIT-B usually commences in January and goes on till April. This year, the process was suspended in March following the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. While 1,204 students from the 2019-20 graduating batch have already been placed, the institute has requested all companies to defer the joining dates till August 1. 

Most companies have responded in the affirmative, said the official.

At National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) in Powai, the administration has begun online exams for 410 postgraduate students to enable them to join respective firms post lockdown, on a provisional graduation status.
