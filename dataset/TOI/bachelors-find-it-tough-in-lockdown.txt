TRICHY: While families enjoyed a comfortable Sunday by locking themselves in the houses, bachelors and people who stay in private stay facility (locally called mansion) in the city had a tough time in sourcing food. Though online food delivery platforms were operational in the city, the high demand owing to the extended lockdown has put them in a misery.


“Fortunately, there was food delivery option available in the mobile application. But many of the inmates in my mansion had managed to feed their hunger with bread and biscuits they purchased on Saturday,” R Aravind, a student residing in a mansion at Woraiyur, said. 

The youths residing in the mansions have managed to stock eatables and snacks from a few tea shops and cafés that were opened on Sunday morning. Bachelors residing in mansions said that their friends in the city came to their rescue by bringing cooked food. tnn
