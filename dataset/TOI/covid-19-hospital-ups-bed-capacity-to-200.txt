2020-05-22
MARGAO: After witnessing the state’s active coronavirus cases go from zero to more than 40 in a week’s time, the government has increased the capacity of the Covid-19 hospital in Margao from 170 to 200 beds.

Only on Tuesday, the bed capacity was increased from 100 to 170 beds. 

“We are ready to cater to 200 patients,” said Dr Ira Almeida, deputy director, health services.

Health secretary Nila Mohanan told reporters that the target is to enhance capacity further, to 220 beds. The need was felt after fresh cases began coming in, she said. 

The hospital has a six-bedded ICU and a four-bedded paediatric ICU (PICU). “We have the potential to use ventilators for 40 patients at a time. We are ready for oxygen cylinders to be used for 100 beds. We also have backup, and can scale up to 200 at any time,” Almeida said. 

The hospital also has a separate paediatric ward which is currently occupied by five children, including two infants accompanied by their mothers, who were admitted over the past week. 

Specialist patient care will be provided by a team from Goa Medical College and Hospital, and they will be supported by the team of doctors from the ESI hospital. 

All the nurses are provided by the director of health services.

Mohanan said the experience around the country and world have proved that the first option would be to give a patient oxygen supply and only if that fails should the patient be put on a ventilator. 

“There are sufficient ICU and oxygen beds,” Mohanan said, adding that the government of India, ministry of health and family welfare has asked states to pay more emphasis on availability of oxygen beds. 

While the paediatric ward and ICU are on one floor, the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients have also been accommodated on different wards on different floors of the hospital. A backup floor is also equipped and ready.
