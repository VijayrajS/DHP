Private lab in Vijayawada gets ICMR nod to hold Covid-19 tests
2020-06-13
VIJAYAWADA: In a major development, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given permission to a private diagnostic centre in Vijayawada to perform the Covid-19 test. Apollo Diagnostics situated at Tikkle road was granted permission to collect samples from suspected Covid-19 patients and perform the diagnostic test.


The number of Covid-19 suspects approaching the government hospitals and testing centres has been increasing every day and it has been an uphill task for Krishna district administration to test all suspect cases. The governmentâ€™s testing centres are taking two to three days to revert with the result. Testing has also become a huge financial burden for the state government.

Apollo Diagnostics will begin performing tests from Saturday. 

However, Andhra Pradesh state government has directed the diagnostic centre to charge only Rs 2,900 per test, though many laboratories in other states are charging Rs 4,500 for a test. The diagnostic centre said that they are making arrangements to collect the samples at the doorstep of patients.
