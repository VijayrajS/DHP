Virus takes a toll on hospitality sector
2020-04-01
Bhubaneswar: With the coronavirus pandemic rattling the global economy and disrupting supply chains, the future of the Indian tourism and hospitality industry looks grim.

Worried over financial losses and the volatile markets, the Hotel Association of India (HAI) has sought help from the Centre and the state government, urging them to grant tax holidays and waive some taxes and bills so that the industry can revive from the deep downturn in earnings.

In a letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, HAI president Puneet Chhatwal said the hotel occupancies were nearly zero owing to the wave of cancellations and suspension of airline services. “The revenue is at an all-time low and is on the verge of drying out,” the letter further said. “In this unprecedented time, the industry is in dire need of support from the government for its survival and subsequent revival,” the letter said.

HAI’s honorary secretary J K Mohanty said, “Following the lockdown in the state, hotels across Odisha became empty as the guests were asked to vacate their rooms. Even the hotels that are being used as paid quarantine facilities are not yielding good response. However, we have to pay the staff and maintain the properties.”

The HAI has urged the government to provide GST, licence fee and excise and other licences’ holidays for six months. They have also requested the government to defer utility bills and waive electricity duty for one year and property and municipal taxes and miscellaneous charges for six months. “The hospitality sector contributes significantly to the state’s revenue and is among the top foreign exchange earners and employment generators. We are confident of your support,” the letter said.
