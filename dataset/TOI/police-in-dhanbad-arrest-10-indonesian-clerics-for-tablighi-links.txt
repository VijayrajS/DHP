SINDRI: A day after Jamshedpur police sent 11 foreign clerics to jail for violating visa norms, Dhanbad police on Sunday forwarded 10 Indonesian clerics having links with Tablighi Jamaat to jail on similar charges taking the total count to 21.

Surendra Kumar Singh, the inspector in-charge of Govindpur Police Station, said, “The Indonesian clerics have been booked under Sections 7,13 and 14 of the Foreigners Act, besides different sections for violating lockdown rules and spreading coronavirus.”

The religious preachers, who came to India on tourist visa, along with two Mumbai-based clerics were caught by Govindpur police on March 26 from Asanbani Mosque. They were alleged to have participated in the Tablighi Jamaat sessions in Delhi before arriving in Dhanbad. After the initial medical check-up, they were allowed to remain in quarantine in the mosque itself. But later, police sent them to a 14-day quarantine at IIT(ISM). On April 7, the police formally lodged a case of visa rules violation against all the Indonesian nationals and their mobile phones were seized as they were found to be in contact with Tablighi Jamaat preachers all over the nation.

“As their quarantine period ended on April 15, they were subjected to Covid-19 test again on April 16 and after the test reports came negative, they were forwarded to judicial custody on Sunday,” another official said.
