Bihar changes tack, to go for 1,000 random Covid-19 tests a day

PATNA: With the increase in inflow of migrants to Bihar, the state government has decided to go for a new strategy to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic — random samplings of 1,000 migrants in a day with focus on those coming from red zones.


And, one of the major weapons in this new strategy will be the use of Truenat machines, which are used to test drug resistant Tuberculosis (TB). CM Nitish Kumar has directed that the procurement of these units be expedited.

State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said the change in strategy has been initiated keeping in mind migrants who are coming back in large numbers.

“Now we are concentrating more on migrants. Also locally we are not getting many positive cases. We are going to do random testing because many positive cases are asymptomatic,” he said, adding, “We will go for one thousand random tests in a day and have started this process from Thursday.”

Sanjay further said migrants coming to Bihar have been classified into three categories, depending from which zones they are coming, red, orange or green. Those coming from red zones will be tested on priority basis. “District magistrates have been told to go for smart random testing. That is, even though random testing has to be done, officials will stress on migrants who have come from red zones and even among them those who are above 60 years,” he added.

It is estimated that around 27 lakh migrants are stranded outside the state in this lockdown. Approximately two lakh had come back before the issuing of the May 1 guideline by the Centre.

Sanjay said Truenat machines will be used for the first time in Bihar for screening of Covid-19 cases. “Thirty machines have been given by the Centre and the state is procuring 10 on its own. Fifteen of these machines are on way and are expected to reach Bihar on Friday. Each district hospital will get one machine. If a sample tests negative on Truenat, it means no coronavirus. But if a sample tests positive on this machine, then it will be again tested on RT-PCR,” said Sanjay, adding, 40 to 42 samples can be tested on one machine in a day.

Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had on April 10 validated the use of Truenat machine for Covid-19 test. So far, only reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was being used in Bihar for Covid-19 test. As per the information shared by state health society, 29841 samples had been tested till Thursday morning.
