Over 50 per cent of all Covid-19-related deaths are from 5 wards in Mumbai

MUMBAI: With Mumbai crossing 1,000 coronavirus deaths, a look at ward-wise data shows that five of the 24 wards in the city have recorded over a 100 Covid-related deaths each, led by 154 in L ward covering Kurla and Saki Naka (see box). In comparison, some large states have recorded similar or fewer fatalities, like UP (169), Tamil Nadu (119), AP and Telangana (56) each, and Karnataka 44.

The civic data mentions the fatalities were among Covid-19 positive patients but a death committee will finally certify whether the deaths were caused by the coronavirus or these were patients who died with it. At first glance, however, the figures indicate that only five wards account for more than 57% of the city’s fatalities (1065 on Tuesday).



Interestingly, G North that has reported the maximum cases of over 2,000 has not yet crossed the 100-death mark. The ward including Dharavi has reported 85 deaths so far.

In L ward, 66 of its 154 fatalities were among people above 60. The 46-60 age group accounted for 65 deaths, 18 were among 31-45-year-olds, and five among youngsters between 16 and 30. “We are trying to screen as many elderly in the ward as possible so that in case of any symptoms, they can be given help as soon as possible,” said a ward official.

The silver lining in L ward is the recovery rate: 52%. As many as 872 of the 1,667 patients have recovered, said the official.

Rais Shaikh, corporator of E ward (Byculla and Mumbai Central), said all resources should now be focused towards helping patients with co-morbid conditions, like diabetes and hypertension. “The condition of patients having co-morbidities deteriorates faster, so it is important they are stabilised faster to control the mortality rate,” he said. E ward has reported over 1,700 cases and 129 deaths.

In wards like K West (Andheri W) and M East (Govandi and Mankhurd), civic officials said most of the 100-plus deaths were from the slum areas. “In slum pockets, homes are too small and people refuse to stay locked down. Also, community toilets are a large source of infection,” said a civic official, adding they are now trying to quarantine 15 contacts for every positive case in the slums to break the chain of infection.

Another ward with high fatality is H East (Bandra E, Santacruz). Congress corporator Tulip Miranda, who represents Kalina, said an average 50-60 new Covid cases are being reported daily from the ward. “The figures are alarming and it does not seem to be coming under control at all. With lockdown not being taken seriously, we find people moving around freely,” she said.
