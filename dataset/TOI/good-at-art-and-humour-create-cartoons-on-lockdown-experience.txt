Good at art and humour? Create cartoons on lockdown experience

Panaji: Within two days of its announcement, the ‘Who will be the next Mario Miranda’ contest has received around 100 entries from budding cartoonists. The online competition on the theme ‘Life in the time of Coronavirus’ will mark late artist’s 94th birth anniversary.

“Mario’s greatest virtue was always being able to see the funny side of things. The competition is an opportunity to look at the present situation differently and not so seriously. Mario would have found humour in a queue to buy groceries or someone getting lathi-charged. Instead of everyone sitting at home and worrying, we thought this competition would keep them occupied and allow them to think of humourous things,” curator of Mario Gallery, architect Gerard da Cunha told TOI.

The competition is open to the artistic with a funny bone in four age categories right from 10 years of age to those above 70 years. The last date for entries is April 30 and da Cunha, along with Mario’s two sons will judge the entries. The results will be announced on Mario’s birthday, May 2.

Da Cunha said the entries that have already come and the children who sent in posters, have been told to turn them into cartoons which get the message across subtly like how Mario’s cartoons did.
