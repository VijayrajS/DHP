Vadodara: The very thought of being locked into a quarantine facility may sound like solitary confinement, but that is hardly the case if the experience of a person who spent 10 days there is anything to go by.

Umlesh Pandit, who spent 10 days at the quarantine facility at the State Institute of Health and Family Welfare (SIHFW), dispels many notions attached with the facility. He had opted to go there with his family after a relative who returned from abroad tested positive for COVID-19.

“We opted to go to the facility right away instead of insisting on staying in home quarantine,” he said.

Pandit, his wife Kalpana and son Shubham were kept in different rooms a SIHFW. “The rooms were spacious with an attached bathroom. We were given with fresh towels, toilet kits and slippers,” he said.

“Diabetics like me were given tea, coffee and milk without sugar. Those who did not eat dinner were given fruits and milk. Those serving us were also polite and never complained,” he said. 

“We used to inquire about each other’s health and talk as a family,” he said. Pandit’s daughter Riya is studying MBBS in Spain. She stays with a relative there and is safe.
