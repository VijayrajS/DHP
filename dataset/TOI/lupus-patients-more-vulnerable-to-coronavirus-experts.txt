Lupus patients more vulnerable to coronavirus: Experts
2020-05-10
AMARAVATI: The protracted lockdown could make patients with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, more vulnerable to coronavirus, fear doctors. Lupus weakens the immune system, which could make them prone to coronavirus.

Experts noted that the governments should set special focus on such patients and allow them to get treated on war footing as neither the lockdown, nor Covid-19, are likely to end soon. “Lupus attacks healthy tissues. This can make the immune system less effective at fighting infections. Medications that suppress the immune system, which people with lupus often take, might also limit the patients’ ability to respond to infections. As a result, people with lupus are less able to fight bacteria and viruses, like Covid-19,” observed noted rheumatologist Dr Manukonda Muralikrishna of Guntur Rheumatology and Immunology Center. He explained that when people with lupus may also have other ailments such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, which put them at higher risk from coronavirus.

According to Muralikrishna, the number of people with lupus have been growing. “Studies showed that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger it,” said Dr Muralikrishna.
