CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu on Thursday reported 580 Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s tally past 5,000 to 5,409. As the number of cases soared in the state capital and its neighbouring districts, all linked to the Koyambedu cluster, epidemiologists and public health experts warned that the crowds at liquor shops that opened on Thursday could result in another cluster and another surge in infections.


“What we saw in Tasmac shops reminded us of the rush to Koyamedu market as soon as the state announced the lockdown. All social distancing norms were violated. We will see the ramifications in four to five days in the form of a new cluster,” said former city health officer P Kuganandam.

 


Of the new cases, 316 were recorded in Chennai, taking the city’s count to 2,644. All its neighbours registered fresh cases – Tiruvallur recorded 63 cases taking its score to 192, Chengalpet recorded 13 cases taking its total to 158, and Kancheepuram recorded two cases taking its total to 89. The Koyambedu cluster continued to impact at least 22 districts including Villupuram (45 new cases), Perambalur (33), Cuddalore (32) and Ariyalur (24). Krishnagiri reported four cases.

The state’s toll rose to 37 with two deaths – a 56-year-old woman admitted to Kilpauk Medical College died on Wednesday while a 48-year-old woman treated at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital died in the early hours of Thursday. Doctors said both the patients had comorbidities. At least 800 more people were tested on Thursday compared to Wednesday. The state said tests were done for 14,102 people on Thursday compared to 13,281 on Wednesday. According to the data from the ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai has done 2,476 tests per million compared to the national average of 983. On a comparative scale, Maharastra has done 1,549 tests per million, Delhi 3,578, AP has done 2,845, Kerala 977 and Gujarat 1,339. TN has also seen at least 63 positive cases per million compared to the national average of 38. 

The directorate of public health announced, that like Greater Chennai Corporation, the state will also revise the testing protocol. As per the new protocol all family contacts of patients tested positive will undergo mandatory testing. All extended contacts, visitors and co-workers will be quarantined for 14 days and tested if they develop symptoms of the viral infections such as fever, breathlessness or cough. If the extended contacts are above 60 years of age or have comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease or asthma, they will be taken for tests. Besides this, anyone admitted to hospitals with severe respiratory distress or those with flu-like-symptoms will be tested. All pregnant women will have to be tested a week before the expected date of delivery.

“Revision is also there in treatment strategy,” said health minister C Vijayabaskar. Healthy asymptomatic individuals testing positive can be in quarantine at home as long as the treating doctor agrees and notifies it to the public health authority. “We will be giving all patients a kit comprising masks, zinc and vitamins besides nilavembu and kabasura kudineer,” he said. 

As many as 31 people were discharged from various hospitals in the state on Thursday while 3,822 patients were still undergoing treatment.
