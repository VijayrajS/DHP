2020-04-03
JAIPUR: Adarsh Senior Secondary School in Adarsh Nagar, one of the shelter homes in Jaipur district, now houses 144 migrant workers, mainly from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

Meanwhile, 21 have been sent to the houses of their relatives and friends in Jaipur with permission from police officials, the authorities said.

Thirty eight camps and shelter homes have been set in Jaipur district to house migrant labourers for the remaining days of the nationwide lockdown. Nearly 2,000 people are living in all these camps across the district.

The migrant labourers who are staying at the camps are being provided food twice a day, breakfast (biscuits and a cup of tea), sanitizers, hair oil, masks, tooth paste, soaps and blankets. However, authorities are also facing challenges in meeting the demands of the people staying there as they complain about food quality and other facilities.

Soon after they were brought by police from various parts of the city, they underwent a medical test.

“Now, there are 144 migrant labourers in this camp who have been kept in 15 rooms at the school. At least, 10 people are being kept in one room. There isn’t any more space here. We are refusing to accommodate more people if police insists on bringing them. Medical check-up has been done for all and not a single has been found positive for coronavirus,” said Ravi Pratap Singh, in-charge of the camp.

“About 21 people were sent to the houses of their friends and relatives in Jaipur. They were released after seeking permission from police and health officials. They were allowed to go only after somebody had come to pick them up. The constables had dropped them at their respective locations,” he added.

Over 680 labourers are living in the eight camps set up in the Jaipur sub-division. These facilities have been set up in government schools and private buildings across the city.
