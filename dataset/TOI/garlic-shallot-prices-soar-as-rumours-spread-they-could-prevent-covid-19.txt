ERODE: Panic buying after rumour-mongers spread messages that small onion and garlic would cure novel coronavirus has led to increase in prices of vegetables in markets across the district. 


On Thursday morning, hundreds of people thronged the weekly shandy in Sathyamangalam to buy grocery and vegetables. 

“Usually, only locals will come to the shandy. But this time, villagers from nearby villages have also came to the shandy due to the fear of lockdown over Covid-19,” M Saravanan, one of the vendors said. 

Using the opportunity, vendors in the shandy hiked the vegetable prices. 

One kilo of tomato, which was sold for Rs 5 until Wednesday, was sold for Rs 20 on Thursday. Similarly, one kilo of small onion, which was sold for Rs 30, was now sold for Rs 80. “The price of garlic has increased to Rs 100 from Rs 50,” A Raja, one of the buyers said. 

According to the shandy vendors, they usually bring three tonnes of small onions for sale. “Due to sudden demand for small onions, we brought eight tonnes on Thursday,” S Venkatesh, an onion vendor said. Agents who had huge stock sold it for exorbitant price utilizing the opportunity. 

“Many of my regular customers have purchased huge quantity of vegetables from my shop,” P Ganesan, another vendor added.

Meanwhile, Erode-based activist A Aadhavan urged the state government to keep the vegetable and essential commodities prices on control. “Many vendors will utilize the opportunity to increase the prices,” he lamented.
