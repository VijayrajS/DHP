PUNE: Institutional-quarantined persons can be provided food by their family members, who will have to leave them at the reception of these centres, stated administration officials.


However, those quarantined at these centres will not be allowed to meet their family members, said officials.

There are 21 quarantine centres in Pune and PCMC areas and additional facilities are being readied at 18 empanelled hospitals under the Disaster Management Act.

“While all the centres may not have television facility immediately, they will have basic facilities,’’ said PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal, in-charge of quarantine facilities in the city. In the wake of the new directive issued by the Centre on 14-day quarantining for flyers reaching the city following travel to seven high-risk countries, the administration officials said that they have readied all the basic facilities and those quarantined can eat home food. “We have taken preventive measures as per the protocol and we request both the individuals and relatives to cooperate,” she said.

On Friday, 129 passengers reached the city from Dubai. None of them had travelled to the high-risk countries, so they were sent home and asked to go in for home quarantine for 14 days as per the health advisory.
