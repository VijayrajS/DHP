VADODARA: “If I would have not been in India, I would have never fully recovered.” This was Vadodara’s first Covid-19 positive patient’s reaction upon returning home victorious on Tuesday.

Amid thundering cheer, clapping and banging of thalis by his eager neighbours along with residents of Makarpura area, Chirag Pandit (49) acknowledges he was frightened at first. “When I was told that I was infected by the deadly virus, I was frightened,” said Pandit, the coronavirus survivor, who walked home after 14 days in the isolation ward of the state-run SSG Hospital, where he was admitted since March 17.

Pandit has his business interest in Spain and therefore was there between February 27 and March 7, and had landed at the Mumbai airport on March 8. His family is based in Spain. After staying in Mumbai for two days, Pandit had reached Vadodara on March 10.

“I had fever and headache. But the doctors and the staff at SSG Hospital kept motivating me to stay positive assuring me constantly that I will return home healthy,” said Pandit, who also got a call from Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani himself who assured Pandit of getting all required support from the state government.

Before he was discharged from the isolation ward, Vadodara collector Shalini Agrawal too assured Pandit of all support through a video call.

Pandit termed his experience at the hospital as the best medical treatment he could have thought of. “
