MUMBAI: Nearly 200 people, mostly fishermen who work in Mumbai and Thane, are said to have travelled down the coast in boats to beat the Covid-19 lockdown and reach their hometowns in Ratnagiri.

Since the national lockdown was announced on Tuesday, migrant workers, daily-wage labourers and many others left with no income after suspension of operations at their workplaces have been trying to go back home. Some started walking home with their families and belongings while some hid in milk and water tankers or any other vehicle transporting essential goods.

“We have had nearly 200 people alight at different shores in Guhagar over two days,” Datta Bhadakwad, resident deputy collector, Ratnagiri, said. 

Bhadakwad said the police, coast guard and customs were told to patrol the coast to stop such boats from reaching the district.
