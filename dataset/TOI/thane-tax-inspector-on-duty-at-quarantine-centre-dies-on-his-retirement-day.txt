THANE: A 58-year-old civic employee, detected asymptomatic, died at a private Covid hospital on his retirement day. He was admitted to hospital few days back for Covid treatment and discharged within three days without a second test. He had to be wheeled back a day later after he complained of chest pain and breathlessness. 

The family and municipal employees' union alleged negligence by the civic body and hospital, which did not conduct his second test before discharge.

His family said he was a tax inspector with Majiwada-Manpada ward and deployed as a food inspector at Bhayandarpada quarantine centre for nearly two months, much against his family's wishes, citing age and ill health.

His daughter-in-law, a medical officer with health department, said he was found asymptomatic on May 12 and immediately admitted to hospital. His wife, sons and grandchild were also asymptomatic and admitted elsewhere. 

"He had not recovered but was discharged before his second test. I had requested the doctors not to discharge him but they ignored my pleas. The next day he complained of breathlessness and chest pain, and was admitted to the same facility. We were never told about his health initially," said his daughter-in-law.

Family sources said they paid a hefty admission fee.The family claimed they never got access to his case papers and were only informed about his death on Saturday afternoon.

Ravi Rao of Thane municipal employees' union demanded stern action against those responsible. "We have been cautioning the administration not to allow staff above 55 to work but they deployed him at a risky quarantine centre."

TMC said he had recovered but said it would look into it.
