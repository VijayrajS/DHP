MUMBAI: Lodha Developers said on Monday it has sold around 300 units across multiple projects in Mumbai region since the start of the lockdown over four weeks ago. 


On Akshay Tritiya day itself, the group said it sold 80 residential units with a high preference for ready-to-move-in inventories. A company spokesperson said the group’s UK business, too, generated sales of around Rs 150 crore (£15 million) during this period.

Prashant Bindal, chief sales officer, Lodha, said lower interest rates on home loans helped sales. “Ready-to-move-in homes and projects with integrated living are witnessing high interest,’’ he said.

The company said it has provided special financial support for SME vendors and channel partners during the lockdown and has so far served 3.5 lakh free meals to the needy and ensured that sufficient food was made available to the thousands of workmen living at its sites.
