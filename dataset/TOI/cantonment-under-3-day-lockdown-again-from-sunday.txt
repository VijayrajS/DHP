Cantonment under 3-day lockdown again from Sunday
2020-05-23
Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board has decided to impose another three-day complete shutdown in its limits from Sunday. 

This gives residents, who just came out a three-day lockdown on Friday, a day’s respite to stock up on essentials and get important work done. 

PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar said they would issue an order to this effect on Saturday. “On Thursday, we recorded 21 positive cases from Bhimpura, New Modikhana and Modikhana, which was the highest one-day rise so far,” Kumar said. 

Only medical shops will be allowed to operate, from 10am to 1pm and 5pm to 8pm, while milk booths and vegetable shops will be allowed to open from 7am to 10am. “With the help of police and volunteers, we have managed to supply essential items to citizens in severely affected areas,” Kumar added. 

“The strategy of three-day total shutdown and a day’s break seems to be working fairly well,” board member Atul Gaikwad said. “People stock up on vegetables and fruits for three days during the one-day relaxation. This also helps keeping crowds to a minimum,” he said. 

Meanwhile, the results of 10 employees, whose swab samples were collected on Wednesday, have come back negative, said Kumar. “We have closed all our sections till Monday as a precaution. Fewer than 10 employees out of 100 are currently working at our head office near Golibar Maidan.,” the CEO said.
