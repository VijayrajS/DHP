CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu’s Covid-19 surge continued unabated with 805 more cases detected on Monday, taking its tally to 17,082, and public health authorities blamed it on the inflow of people from other states, especially worst-hit Maharashtra.

 


Of the 93 returnees who tested positive on Monday, 87 were from Maharashtra. The toll touched 118 after seven people died at various hospitals in Chennai, which reported 548 cases, mostly from containment zones in Royapuram, Thiru-vi-ka Nagar and Puliyanthope.

As resumption of domestic flights brought in more people from other states,health minister C Vijayabaskar said natives returning from Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal and MP by road and rail made up 5% of the caseload in the past 10 days. Since May 9, 942 returnees had tested positive, he said. “This includes 726 people from Maharashtra, 21 from Gujarat, 15 from Delhi and 19 from West Bengal. We have been able to stop all these people at the check posts or on arrival at railway stations, test and isolate them,” he said. However, with 25 flights expected to land in Chennai alone every day, the risk of infections will go up, he said. As per the revised protocol, TN will continue to screen passengers on arrival.
