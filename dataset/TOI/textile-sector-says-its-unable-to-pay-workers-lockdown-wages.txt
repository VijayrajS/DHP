2020-05-12
Surat: Textile associations of the city have urged the state government to withdraw its notification regarding payment of wages to workers for lockdown period.In a letter to chief minister Vijay Rupani, the associations have stated that the survival of MSME units in the textile sector is at stake due to lockdown. The industry paid full wages to the workers for March, but was not in a position to pay lockdown wages due to its poor financial condition, the letter said.Sachin Industrial Cooperative Society secretary Nilesh Korat said, “The spread of coronavirus and announcement of lockdown to contain it have cast a dark shadow on the textile sector. Since the units are shut for the last one-and-a-half-month, people do not have funds to pay suppliers as they are not receiving pending payments. In such a situation, forcing unit owners to pay wages for lockdown period is not morally correct.”Pandesara Weavers’ Association president Ashish Gujarati said, “We had paid full wages for the month of March and are supplying kits and food packets to workers since the first day of lockdown. There is severe financial crisis in the sector and we are unable to pay lockdown wages. We request the state government to withdraw the notification. Any forceful measure will result in indefinite closure of the units in the city. ”
