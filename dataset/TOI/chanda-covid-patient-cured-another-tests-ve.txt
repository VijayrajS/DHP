Chandrapur: While one of the positive patients from Chandrapur was declared cured, another person was detected Covid-19 positive on Wednesday. Thus, the Covid-19 tally still stands at two in Chandrapur.

Civil surgeon Dr CS Rathod said a family of five had returned to neighbouring Durgapur village from Hyderabad on May 12. They all were placed under institutional quarantine on the following day. Their swab samples were collected on May 18 and three of their test reports came on Wednesday. Dr Rathod claimed that a 55-year-old male has been found Covid positive, while two others — a 20-year-old girl and a two-and-a-half-year-old — have tested negative. Reports of two other family members are awaited, he added. 

First of the two positive patients from Chandrapur, a security guard, was declared cured of Covid-19 infection after his two consecutive swab samples taken after 14 days tested negative. He belonged to Krishna Nagar and was found positive on May 1.

Krishna Nagar and two other localities were declared containment zone and over 8,200 residents in these areas were monitored for 14 days. The security guard’s family and all close contacts had tested negative to Covid-19. He is being treated at GMCH Nagpur for ailments other than Covid-19.

Condition of the other positive patient — 23-year-old girl — is stable, officials told TOI.
