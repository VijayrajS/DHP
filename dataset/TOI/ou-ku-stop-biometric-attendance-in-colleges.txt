Both the state universities have issued circulars to all affiliated colleges as directed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to exempt employees from marking their attendance on the biometric system due to concerns that chances of virus spread through touch may increase.

 
 

“As a preventive measure to curb spread of Covid-19, the principals of campus/constituent and all affiliated colleges under the jurisdiction of Osmania University are hereby informed to withhold recording of the attendance of staff and students of their colleges through Aadhaar-based biometric system until further orders and maintain attendance registers as it was done earlier,” read the circular issued by OU on Thursday. Similar orders were issued in KU on March 7 with staff and students asked to maintain manual attendance until further instructions are issued.

The OU directive comes nearly a month after it made Covid-19 tests mandatory for Chinese students returning from vacation or seeking admissions for the 2020-21 academic year. Even other state universities such as Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Telangana University, and Satvahana University are likely to issue similar directives soon. 

The UGC has also issued detailed guidelines to all higher educational institutions on ways to contain Covid-19 spread. The commission has directed all institutions to avoid large gatherings, disinfect frequently-used surfaces such as door knobs, switches, desktops, and railings within the campus as well as provide alcohol-based sanitisers in colleges and hostels.

The UGC has also asked teachers to be alert and look out for students with cold, cough, fever and difficulty in breathing and have them tested immediately.
