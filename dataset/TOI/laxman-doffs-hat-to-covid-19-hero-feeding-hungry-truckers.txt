2020-05-26
HYDERABAD: Not just on the field, but off it too, VVS Laxman has shown that he’s got a keen eye. The hardship caused by the pandemic was not lost on the Hyderabadi stylist as he lauded the service of a certain Syed Amjad, who feeds lorry drivers and their helpers in Sadashivpet. 


The cricket legend is a consistent presence on social media and his post “Syed Amjad and his family have been feeding 180 lorry drivers and cleaners in Sadashivpet, Telangana. It is so wonderful to see the common man doing incredible service in these challenging times. Hats off to Amjad and everyone who is doing their bit,” evoked plenty of likes and many retweets on Monday. “Feeding the needy is the best kind of service,” Laxman told TOI. “In tough times, the general tendency is to hoard but for Syed to go out of his way to help is amazing and means a lot.” But how does he unearth these stories? “I get to know of these stories through my Foundation (VVS Foundation), friends and family. It is one way of recognising unsung heroes -- a recognition of human spirit. What truly inspires me is that they’re not giving it out of plenty, but from their limited means.”

 “There’s been a lot of time for everyone to introspect life – career, relationships – and approach life in a better perspective. Many people are struggling to make ends meet. We’ve seen migrants dying, weather in the east has not been kind. So if this lockdown was spent realising that nature is the boss, it would’ve been well spent,” he said.
