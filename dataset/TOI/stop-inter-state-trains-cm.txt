Coronavirus scare: Stop inter-state trains, says West Bengal CM
2020-03-22
Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has called for an immediate stop to inter-state trains entering Bengal as there is no mechanism to screen passengers on trains.


Banerjee instructed state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha to get in touch with railway officials after getting news of two special trains, one from Mumbai and the other from Pune, bringing home thousands of migrants working in Maharashtra. 

 Sixty-four people so far have tested positive for Covid-19 in Maharashtra, making it the most severely affected state in the country.

“Why can’t these states take responsibility for these people’s health when they make them work? But they (railways) are not listening. I have asked the state chief secretary to urge railways to stop trains to Kolkata. We will not allow them to enter the state if they keep sending trains here,” the CM told a private television channel on Saturday. tnn

“All three positive cases here are of people coming from abroad. Some of them landed elsewhere in the country and then reached Kolkata. Railways do not have any screening mechanism in place,” she said.

Banerjee urged people to take utmost care. “Don’t step out of your homes for at least a fortnight. This is a precaution one should take in the interests of the family and the state,” she said.
