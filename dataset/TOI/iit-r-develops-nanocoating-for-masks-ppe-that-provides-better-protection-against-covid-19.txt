IIT-Roorkee develops nanocoating for masks, PPE that provides better protection against Covid-19

ROORKEE: Researchers at IIT-Roorkee claim to have developed a nanocoating which when applied to masks, gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE) can provide better protection against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The four-member team which developed the nanocoating said it could reduce the risk of virus transmission by as much as 95%. The coating also eliminated pathogens — such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli — within 10 to 15 minutes in a clinical setting.

Lead researcher professor Naveen K Navani from the department of biotechnology and centre of nanotechnology at the institute, said the team had sent their product to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology for further tests. 

According to Navani, the coating could act as an additional layer of protection for frontline healthcare workers. Once applied, it can remain effective on a surface for three days.

Researchers said the coating was made using silver nanoparticles and a phytochemical from a tulsi plant, called badri tulsi which is found in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand.

Ajmal Hussain, another member of the research team, said the coating could easily be mass produced and a mask polished with this coating would cost only Rs 12, a modest increase over an ordinary mask that costs Rs 10.
