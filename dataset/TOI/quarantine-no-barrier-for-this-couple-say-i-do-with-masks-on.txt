BHOPAL: Rekha and Manish Sahu’s wedding that took place at a quarantine centre, a first of sorts, created quite a stir, although barely 25 people could attend it. The ceremony began at the Beersheba English Medium School in Piparia, Hoshangabad, on Friday. 


Maintaining social distancing, the bride, groom and the pandit sat under the mandap, wearing face masks as the ceremony began. The other guests sat five feet apart and only witnessed the wedding from a distance. "It was mandatory to follow protocol, else the whole purpose of the quarantine would have been defeated. The girl had come back from Indore earlier this month and was sent to quarantine centre as a precautionary measure. The wedding decorators were told to set the chairs further apart and guests were asked to wear masks at all times," said Tehsildar Rajesh Borasi, who coordinated and supervised the quarantine wedding.

The other 60 people quarantined inside the school were asked to stay indoors and not come out to attend the wedding.
