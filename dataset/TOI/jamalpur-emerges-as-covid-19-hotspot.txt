2020-04-21
PATNA: The Munger district administration is on its toes after Jamalpur, a sub-divisional town, emerged as the second major hotpost of Covid-19 pandemic in the state. 

Jamalpur, known for its railway workshop, has recorded 13 out of 20 positive cases from the district till date.

Siwan, however, figures on the top with 29 positive cases. However, no fresh case has been reported from Siwan in the last three days. 

Munger civil surgeon Dr Purusotam Kumar said that a seven-member team from the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), Bhagalpur, is camping at Jamalpur with adequate number of paramedical staff to deal with the cases. The health department officials have already started screening suspects in those areas where 182 persons had travel history. Altogether 442 samples were sent to RMRI in Patna for testing. Of them, 425 were tested negative while the remaining 17 were tested positive. Besides, three more cases were confirmed positive on Saturday, taking the number to 20 in the district.

Out of 13 suspects tested positive from Jamalpur, nine belonged to one family. A 60-year-old man, who had returned from a religious congregation in New Delhi last month, is said to have infected them all, including a six month-old girl and two year-old boy. This has put the district in red zone.

Munger DM Rajesh Meena said that door-to-door screening was carried out in around 3.04 lakh households in the district. Besides, 17.9 lakh people were screened by the health department officials in the last four days. Of them, 41 have been identified as suspected. Their samples have been sent to Patna for test.

Sources in the state police headquarters said that personnel of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed at Jamalpur to assist the district administration.

Of the 38 districts in the state, 14 have so far reported Covid-19 cases.
