Vijayawada: With the police using batons against people gathering in large numbers and to discourage motorists from taking to the roads, most of the residents of Vijayawada city remained confined to their homes on Wednesday.

The police, with the support of few other departments, strictly enforced the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. The police used batons on some motorists at few places in the city to discourage them from taking to the roads uneccesarily. “We will not allow motorists on the roads for unnecessary travel and will act tough against the violators of the lockdown under various sections of IPC,” the police chief added.

Tirumala Rao said that Rythu Bazaars have been relocated from congested locations to the ground in the city for strict implementation of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. “Despite our instructions, some people are coming on the roads unnecessarily and arguing with the police, who have been performing their duties for the safety of the people. We are appealing the people to stay in homes and follow the precautions to fight against the virus,” Tirumala Rao said.

“We have observed that some youngsters are defying the lockdown and riding the bikes at high speeds. We are also examining CCTV footage to register cases against all the violators,” a traffic police officer said.

“Thanks to some videos going viral, where the police were seen beating up motorists for violating the rules of the lockdown, youngsters remained at home on Wednesday,” said K Narayana, a resident.
