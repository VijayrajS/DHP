Stricter implementation of lockdown now: DGP
2020-04-27
Ahmedabad: DGP Shivanand Jha said on Sunday that the lockdown will be implemented more strictly in the state. Talking to mediapersons, he said liquor trafficking in vehicles meant for transporting essential items is a major concern. “A case was registered in Botad where both IMFL and country-made liquor were found in a van being used for transporting milk,” he said.

“There have also been cases of vehicles for essential items carrying people from one district to another. Due to such incidents, the cops have beefed up vigil on such vehicles,” he added.

He said no one will be allowed to move on roads without any valid reason. “They will be booked and their vehicles will be impounded,” he said.

The DGP said that those coming out to buy essential items should use private vehicles. Taxis are prohibited from running on roads during lockdown.
