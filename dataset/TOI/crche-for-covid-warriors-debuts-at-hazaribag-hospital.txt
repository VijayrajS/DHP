2020-04-17
Hazaribag: In a first of its kind in the district, the administration, along with the social welfare department, has set up a crèche at the Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital (HMCH) for female Covid-19 frontline workers who have young children. The crèche has a capacity to accommodate 100 children and was formally launched on Wednesday.

Talking to TOI, Hazaribag DC BP Singh said, “There are many female health staff like doctors, nurses and from other allied services, who are at the forefront of Covid-19 fight but are also facing problems in managing their kids at home and are forced to carry them at workplaces. Hence, to provide some relief to our mainline force, we planned this crèche. This is probably the first in any district during the ongoing crisis.”

Singh said he has personally inspected the facilities and expressed satisfaction that the crèche adheres to safety norms and has dedicated staff to manage it. He said, “It has become functional and I found many children happily playing and spending their time at this place while their mothers are on emergency duty at isolation, quarantine wards or other areas. You can call it as a mini-anganbari at this hospital.”

Across the district, there are 155 quarantine centre in which 2,039 persons are currently lodged. So far, 18,614 persons have been screened for Covid-19 and two persons tested positive in Hazaribag.

Hazaribag SDO Megha Bharadwaj on Thursday issued a host of dos’ and don’ts for medicine and grocery shops to prevent spread of infection. Some of them included mandatory use of masks and sanitisers for both staff and customers, no sale to any customer who doesn’t wear mask and enforcement of social distancing norms among others. The SDO said flying squads will keep inspecting the areas and punitive action will be taken on violation of the norms.
