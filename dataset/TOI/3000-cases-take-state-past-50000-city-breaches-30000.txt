MUMBAI: On a day when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray indicated that the state was yet to see the worst of Covid-19, cases in Maharashtra have touched 50,000 and scaled a grim record of over 3,000 in a single day. With 3,041 registered on Sunday, Maharashtra’s tally stood at 50,231. The journey from the first two cases to half a lakh has taken 77 days. Maharashtra now has a doubling rate of 11 days. Notably, of the 50,231 cases, as many as 39,756 (79%) were recorded in May. 


Mumbai meantime set its own worrying record of 30,000 cases and inched closer to 1,000 deaths. It also recorded 1,725 cases in a day, its second highest jump on a single day, taking the count of positive cases to 30,542. With 39 deaths, the city’s death toll is now 988. The state recorded 58 deaths on Sunday, taking the toll so far to 1,635. Mumbai continues to account for 60% of the state’s fatalities. 

 

Starting from May 6, the state has recorded over 1,000 cases daily for 12 days in a row. Thereafter, it has started seeing a further surge. For the last six days, it has recorded over 2,000 cases every single day. On Sunday, it crossed the 3,000-mark in one day. The only silver lining was, 1,194 patients went home on Sunday, taking the count of recovered people to 14,600. State’s recovery rate continues to be 29%.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in an address, said the crucial period is yet to come, and the state has to brace for the worst. He called for precautions to be taken since the rains are approaching. Anticipating a shortage of blood, he appealed for donors as the state faces a shortfall of blood units. “We have blood which will suffice only for 8-10 days. We need blood for Covid-19 and non-Covid patients,” said Thackeray.

The CM further added that the number of beds available for Covid-19 patients would increase to 14,000 by May-end. He said field hospitals have been set up with ICU beds and oxygen facilities as more patients would need oxygen than ventilators. He also thanked citizens for complying with social distancing norms and lockdown rules, which he said, had helped keep the case load below 50,000 at a time when a central team had projected 1.25 to 1.5 lakh patients till May-end.

The civic authorities said the city’s Covid-19 growth rate from May 16 to May 22 was 6.61%. They claimed that only eight of the city’s 24 civic wards have a growth rate of more than 8%. The maximum growth rate (13.7%) was seen in N ward that covers Ghatkopar and Vidyavihar. BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said wards that have a higher growth rate need stricter containment measures and greater participation from citizen groups in terms of social distancing.

In terms of augmenting facilities, Kakani added that doctors have undertaken a dry run of the jumbo facility in MMRDA, BKC and it was likely to be thrown open for patients from Monday. “We will be starting with 100 patients and gradually scale it up to 400. The overall capacity of the centre is 1,008 beds of which 50% will have oxygen support,” he said. In the next few days, facilities at NESCO in Goregaon and Mahalaxmi will be opened. 

Across the state, there were 58 deaths due to Covid-19, of which 39 were from Mumbai, six from Pune, six from Solapur, four from Aurangabad and one each from Latur, Mira-Bhayandar and Thane. Of the total 58 deaths, 34 were male and 24 females. Thirty of them were over 60 years, 27 were from the age group of 40 to 59 years and one patient was younger than 40 years. Forty out of 58 patients (67%) had co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. According to the state health department, 38 deaths occurred in the last 24 hours and the rest between April 23 and May 20.
