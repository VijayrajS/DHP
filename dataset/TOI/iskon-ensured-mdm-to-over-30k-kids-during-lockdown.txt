Jamshedpur: The Annamrita Foundation of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) served mid-day meals to schoolchildren in East Singhbhum and Seraikala-Kharsawan districts during the entire lockdown period. 

The foundation said it supplied over 22 lakh meals in Jamshedpur and its peripheral areas, covering suburban and slums, which are located close to government schools. 

Annamrita Foundation manager Sudhir Kumar said, “Our objective is to see that children staying home during the lockdown can avail meals. We made a deliberate effort to organise our food distribution camps close to schools so that children living in the surrounding areas can collect the meals.”

He said out of the 377 government schools in the East Singhbhhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts, where Annamrita Foundation supply MDM, close to 210 schools were covered during the lockdown. “Over 30,000 schoolchildren must have received the meals,” Kumar said.

He said the programme was run with support from Tata Steel and Jamipol companies. The foundation also said it assisted the state government in the transportation of raw rice packets to government schoolchildren under the MDM scheme.

“For 37 days in April and May, raw rice bags were transported to government schools for distribution of 100-gram rice packets each of the children of Class I to V and 150-gram rice packets for Class VI to VIII students to make up for the loss of the mid-day meals due to the lockdown,” Kumar added.
