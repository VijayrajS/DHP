NEW DELHI: An infant born to a Covid-19 positive mother, wife of a senior resident doctor at AIIMS who had also tested positive, has tested negative for the disease. Hospital sources said the baby’s mother is asymptomatic, but is still positive for Covid-19. “The infant is doing well,” said a senior doctor.


The hospital is recording the health status of the mother and her infant for future reference, the doctor added, because this was India’s first case of child delivery from a Covid-19 patient.

The baby boy was delivered on April 3 through caesarean section surgery. One day before that, the senior resident doctor working in the department of physiology at AIIMS and his nine-month-pregnant wife had tested positive for Covid-19.

Recently, another woman who delivered a healthy baby at RML hospital tested positive for the disease. The doctors said the baby is doing well.

According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, mother-to-child transmission of coronavirus during pregnancy is unlikely, but after birth a newborn is susceptible to person-to-person spread. 

“A very small number of babies have tested positive for the virus shortly after birth. However, it is unknown if these babies got the virus before or after birth,” the CDC said.The virus was not detected in amniotic fluid, breastmilk, or other maternal samples.
