HYDERABAD: Researchers at IIT Hyderabad have developed an artificial intelligence-powered low-cost testing kit to detect the novel coronavirus in 20 minutes flat.


The cost of Covid-19 test using the new kit will be around Rs 600 only, while each test is currently being conducted for Rs 4,500. Mass production of the new kit will help reduce the test cost further to around Rs 350.

This new kit is part of the three Covid-19 testing kits being developed by IIT-H. While this kit was developed within a week, the other two will take about three to six months. The device has been sent to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, and the National Institute of Biologicals, Pune, for evaluation
