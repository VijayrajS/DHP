DEHRADUN: A 32-year-old cancer patient who died in Ramnagar while in home quarantine was reported Covid-19-positive, barely an hour after his death on Thursday. His family members were quarantined soon after his cremation. Health officials attributed the man’s death to cancer.


According to the health department, the man, a resident of Ramnagar’s Shiv Mandir locality, was working as an executive at a multinational firm in New Delhi. He was suffering from liver cancer for the past several months and was undergoing treatment at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Delhi, since January.

However, on May 25, he was brought back to home in the ambulance and was subsequently home quarantined with three other family members, including his wife.

“The man died on Thursday morning and the family received the reports of his Covid-19 test around an hour after his death. His sample was tested in Delhi,” said SHO of Ramnagar, Ravi Sainin.

Chief medical officer, Nainital, Dr Bharti Rana told TOI that his family was quarantined soon after the administration received the information of the deceased man testing positive.

“The cause of death, in this case, is advanced stage cancer,” added Dr Rana.
