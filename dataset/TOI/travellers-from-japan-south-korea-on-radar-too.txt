PUNE: State health officials have started screening and tracking travellers arriving from Japan and South Korea, besides China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand, in the wake of the novel coronavirus threat. 

 
 
The decision follows the latest diktat from the Union health ministry. “Travellers residing in Maharashtra and coming from Japan and South Korea are also being screened at the Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) and later tracked for 14 days to rule out novel coronavirus infection. They will also be quarantined and tested in case of any symptoms. Field surveillance is also actively going on across the state in search of people coming from the affected countries,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.

In addition to Mumbai, Pune and Thane, travellers are also being monitored in Nanded, Buldhana, Nagpur, Wardha, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Amaravati, Palghar, Jalgaon, Chandrapur and Satara districts, health officials said.

A total of 27, 894 passengers returning from China and other affected countries have so far been screened at the CSMIA since January 18. Of them, 173 travellers were put under 14-day surveillance and 41 of them were quarantined in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and other parts of the state after they developed flu-like symptoms.

“Of the 41 travellers who developed minor illnesses, 40 have tested negative for the coronavirus infection in the state and the report of one traveller is awaited,”Awate said.

When it comes to Pune, 16 travellers including a child were quarantined at civic-run Naidu hospital over the last three weeks after they complained of minor illness. “All of them have tested negative for the virus and have been discharged,” Ramchandra Hankare, the Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department chief, said.
