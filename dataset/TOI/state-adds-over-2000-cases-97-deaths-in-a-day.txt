MUMBAI: The state on Tuesday reported 97 Covid-19 deaths, the highest in a single day so far. With that, Maharashtra’s death toll climbed to 1,792. Mumbai saw 39 of the deaths, taking the city’s fatalities to 1,065. State officials claimed 62 of the deaths took place last week and were being scrutinised by the death review committee.


On Tuesday, the city added 2,091 cases, taking the overall count of cases to 54,758. Mumbai added 1,002 new cases, taking the overall incidence for the city to 32,974. Mumbai has been among the four cities across the world with the highest daily count of cases over the past four-five days.

BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said that since the corporation was adopting a more aggressive approach of “chasing the virus,” the city could see more cases in the days to come. In what can be an indicator of the disease progression, he said the corporation was preparing 1.5 lakh Covid-19 beds till mid-June.

The commissioner maintained that over 1.75 lakh people have already been tested in the city that now has a positivity rate of 18%. “We have done 13,400 tests per million, which is way ahead of what entire states have achieved,” he said. He added that of the currently active cases, around 15,800 were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Chahal said the lockdown has given them time to prepare for a surge once restrictions are withdrawn.

State chief secretary Ajoy Mehta said the lockdown was helpful in reducing the rate of increase in cases and in adding hospital beds in the state. Mehta said the time taken for cases to double too has gone up to 14 days. There were a total of 72 labs in 15 districts of the state and permission for 22 new labs had been sought. As on Monday, the state had a daily capacity of 13,000 tests. “Nearly 66 lakh people or 6% of the state population has been screened by 16,000- plus squads,” he said. He said the state had not added cases as was feared. “There were projections that we will be adding 1.5 lakh cases till the end of May, we won’t reach anywhere close to that number,” Mehta said.

The commissioner also said nearly 3,700 doctors have responded to their call to join the civic Covid services, of which 570 have shown willingness to work in the jumbo hospitals at MMDRA, BKC, Nesco in Goregaon and the NSCI Dome in Worli.

Meanwhile, Thane recorded 122 fresh cases, including two doctors who tested positive, taking the tally there to 2,294.

The state said that of the 97 Covid deaths, 39 were in Mumbai, 15 in Thane, 10 in Kalyan-Dombivli, 8 in Pune, 7 in Solapur, 5 in Aurangabad, 5 in Mira-Bhayandar, 3 each in Malegaon and Ulhasnagar and one each in Nagpur and Ratnagiri. About 65 of the 97 patients (67%) had high-risk co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease,etc.

The BEST Workers’ Union, meanwhile, has petitioned the transport undertaking saying 19 of its staffers died recently while on duty, and eight had been declared as Covid deaths. It has demanded that “detailed scrutiny” be conducted of all the deceased persons.
