Pune: At least 100 police personnel posted at a centrally located police station in Pune city were on Monday sent to either institutional or home quarantine as a precautionary measure after three of their colleagues tested positive for Covid-19, recently. 

All the quarantined personnel are believed to have come in contact with the three positive patients, a senior police officer said.

Their swab samples have been collected for analysis and the reports are awaited, said a senior police officer.

The three policemen, who tested positive a week ago, along with their family members, have been admitted to hospitals in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.

The 100 policemen will be allowed to resume their duties only after their test reports are received, the officer said.

Meanwhile, the police station and the police chowkies under its jurisdiction were sealed on Monday morning for disinfection and sanitisation. 

“The police station and its chowkies were closed for about five to six hours on Monday,” the officer said.

The police station has sought manpower from other police stations and the crime branch for routine work and for bandobast duty.

Adequate manpower has been provided to the police station for check point duties and bandobast in the red zone areas under the police station. 

The jurisdiction of this police station includes market places, hospitals, a large number of old wadas and four slum pockets.
