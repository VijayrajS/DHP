MYSURU: Three youths from Mandya, who escaped from a checkpost by claiming they were Covid-19 patients and created panic in their village recently, are now cooling their heels in jail. On April 8, Mahesh, Abhi and Srinivas, all in their 20s, were travelling in an autorickshaw when police personnel stopped them at a checkpost near Jockey Factory in Tendekere at 10.45pm. 


The youths got down from the vehicle and threatened to spread the disease if police tried to arrest them. One of them even showed quarantine seal on his hand. When cops were puzzled, the trio sped away.

Police alerted KR Pet taluk tahsildar M Shivamurthy and they traced the youths to Bhallekere village in Bhukanakere hobli, 8km from KR Pet town. During interrogation, they confessed to have lied to police at the checkpost. Mahesh, an auto driver in Bengaluru, was stamped because he had returned to his village from an infected area.
