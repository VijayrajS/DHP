PUNE: A woman employee of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) in the city was sent to Naidu Hospital for check-up because she helped the coronavirus-affected cab driver in signing some documents when he went to the facility on March 3, after driving the contagion-hit couple to the city from Mumbai.

“The cab driver had signed some papers related to a bank loan termination and left the building. We came to know about it on Wednesday, after which the woman employee, who helped him, was identified and sent to Naidu Hospital. The doctors said she was fine but advised her 17-day rest at home,” Sanjeev Bhor, the deputy RTO, told TOI.

A senior official said the RTOs were expected to suspend biometric attendance soon. Pune RTO Ajit Shinde said hand sanitizers had been kept in different places. “The employees have been told to apply them on their hands before going for the biometric attendance,” he said.

More than 100 employees, including senior officials, are posted at the Pune RTO office near Sangam bridge.

“An additional 152 beds across the rail hospitals in the Pune division have been readied for people who need to be quarantined,” a railway official said, adding that the biometric attendance system at the divisional railway manager (DRM)’s office in Pune had been suspended.
