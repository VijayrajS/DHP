Covid-19 scare: Exempt us from going to colleges, demand Patliputra University teachers
2020-03-20
PATNA: Patliputra University Teachers’ Association (PPUTA) on Thursday submitted a memorandum to governor-cum-chancellor of universities Phagu Chauhan, urging him to ask the state government to exempt teachers of the postgraduate (PG) departments and constituent colleges located in Nalanda and Patna districts from going to colleges every day at a time when all institutions have been closed for students till March 31 by the state government due to Covid-19 scare.


PPUTA president A K Singh Thakur said university and college teachers have been asked to ensure their presence in the colleges every day as per the state government directive issued on March 13. “The state government has closed all colleges for students to prevent spread of Covid-19. There is no rationale behind making presence of teachers mandatory in the colleges when classes are suspended,” Thakur said, adding most colleges have no separate rooms for teachers to sit and spend at least five hours every day.

General secretary of the association Hridya Narayan Singh said some teachers were forced to sit in a congested staff room in the colleges which could be harmful for them in view of the Covid-19 scare. “Most colleges in rural and semi urban areas have not adopted any precautionary measure against Covid-19. It would be much better if teachers are exempted from coming to colleges daily,” he said.
