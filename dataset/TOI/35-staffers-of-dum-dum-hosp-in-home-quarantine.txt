KOLKATA: Around 35 staffmembers at a private hospital in Dum Dum, including doctors, nurses and other workers, have been sent to home quarantine after a 48-year-old nursing superintendent there was admitted to the isolation ward on the suspicion of being Covid-19 positive on Thursday. 

The latest case came barely five days after a doctor of a Colonel rank, posted at Alipore Command Hospital in Kolkata, had tested positive for Covid-19. Two more Covid-19 suspects are still undergoing treatment in the same hospital at Nagerbazar in Dum Dum, where the nursing superintendent has also been admitted in the isolation ward. 

The hospital authorities, however, said that the three patients, including the nurse, were recovering. The nurse, a resident of Madhyamgram’s Michelnagar near the airport, has been working with the hospital for a couple of years. 

“She used to look after all patients as a senior and superintendent of nurses. Even her husband tested negative for Covid-19. The exact cause behind her infection couldn't be ascertained so far,” sources said. 

“She fell ill with fever and slight breathing trouble on Tuesday. So, she was admitted in her hospital's isolation ward. Her swab samples were collected on Wednesday and sent to NICED. She is a Covid-19 suspect," sources added. “We are working on to set up an isolation ward with adequate infrastructure to combat Covid-19. The trio, including our nursing superintendent, are stable now. We hope all of them will be released soon,” a senior doctor of the hospital’s emergency department told TOI. 

Panic, however, gripped the residents of Michelnagar in Madhyamgram as the news of a Corona suspect from their area spread like wildfire. 

Subodh Chakraborty, chairman of North Dum Dum Municipality, who led a municipal team to sanitise the area, said that there was no reason for locals to be scared of.
