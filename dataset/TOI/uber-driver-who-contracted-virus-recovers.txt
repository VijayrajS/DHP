Kochi: The Uber driver who is believed to have contacted Covid-19 from a man considered to be the first person to die of the virus in the state on Thursday walked out of Kalamassery medical college after recovering from the disease. When Latheesh T L picked up a passenger, Yakoob Sait, from Kochi international airport for dropping him at Chullikkal on March 16, it was nothing more than a regular cab drop for him. 

Four days later, he developed a fever and treated it the normal way but on March 23 he got a call from health department officials in Ernakulam.

 They traced him after Sait tested positive for Covid-19 on March 22. "I reported for a swab test on March 23 and was asked to go on quarantine. On March 25, a day after Sait's wife too tested positive he again got a call. "I still had fever and my stomach was paining. So, I decided to get admitted," he said. 

“The facilities at Kalamassery medical college were excellent. The food was great and the most comforting factor was that doctors and nurses would frequently check on you,” said Latheesh, who hails from Vallarpadam.
