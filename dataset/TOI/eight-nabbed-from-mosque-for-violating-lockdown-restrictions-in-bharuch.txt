SURAT: About eight people were arrested for assembling in a mosque in violation of lockdown restrictions imposed due to coronavirus threat in Bharuch on Friday. The arrests have been made due to fear of spread of COVID-19 as 62 people from Bharuch had attended a religious congregation in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area in March that led to spike in cases there. These 62 individuals are under home quarantine. 

Bharuch town police registered an FIR against the eight people under IPC sections 188 and 269 for disobedience and negligent act to spread infection of disease dangerous to life and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. They were noticed during a surveillance carried out by a drone over a mosque located at Ratan Talav in Bharuch. 

The accused are Ismail Patel, Imran Umarji Patel, Ashfaque Mohammed Qureshi, Wasim Lalu Khan, Mohammed Lalu Khan Pathan, Maulvi Khalid Aslam Shaikh, Mohammed Wasim Khalifa and Afran Shaikh. 

DP Vaghela, deputy superintendent of police (Dy.SP), Bharuch, said, “We reached the mosque with five panchs (witnesses) and nabbed the eight people, including the maulvi and the trustee of the mosque. After the Nizamuddin incident, there are clear directions from the state government to keep a close watch on illegal assembly of people at religious places.”
