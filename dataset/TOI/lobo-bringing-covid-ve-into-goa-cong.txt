Panaji: Congress on Saturday said that Calangute MLA Michael Lobo is exerting pressure on senior bureaucrats and officials to let in people from other states.

The party also blamed Lobo for issuing travel passes to people to enter the state and said that the chief minister is unable to control Lobo . “This is a big racket and CM should investigate as Lobo is issuing letters to certain people,” Congress spokesperson Agnel Fernandes said. The former Calangute MLA said that the Calangute incident wherein a senior citizen tested positive for Covid-19 is not an isolated event or a human error.“The collector is supposed to be issuing letters and no other minister is issuing letters not even the health minister, but this person is issuing letters on the pretext of getting essential commodities,” he said.

In the Calangute incident wherein a senior citizen tested positive, Fernandes said that Lobo should be blamed. “To bring this woman from the border, a request went from the office of this minister. I request the CM to check the call details of whoever was on duty at the border,” he said.

Party spokesperson Urfan Mulla called for the resignation of health minister Vishwajit Rane for the rising number of Covid-19 cases.
