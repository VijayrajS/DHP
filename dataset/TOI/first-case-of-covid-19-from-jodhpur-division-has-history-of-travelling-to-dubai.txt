Jodhpur: A person who had been admitted to the isolation ward in Pali’s Bangar Hospital was found positive for coronavirus on Saturday. His entire family has been quarantined at home. The medical and health department has been trying to identify all those in his village, who had come into contact with him. 

According to joint director (medical and health) Yudhveer Singh Rathore, a youth from village Dhola in Pali district had returned from Dubai on March 18. In spite of the symptomatic indicators, he did not visit the hospital. 

“On the information about a foreign visit by him, our team went to his home and took him to the hospital for isolation. His samples were sent for examination, which tested positive for Covid-19,” said Rathore adding that his treatment has started. He, however, expressed relief that none of his family members has tested positive, but they have been still kept under observation for conclusive results. 

Meanwhile, about 62 samples of suspects have been taken in all the six districts of Jodhpur division and except the one from Pali, none has been tested positive for Covid-19. In the given scenario, all those persons coming from abroad have emerged as a major threat for other people. 

According to Rathore, there have been multiple cases, where such persons have escaped reporting to the medical department for screening despite having symptomatic indicators. 

“Such negligent persons, god forbid, if carried virus, could be potential threat to the rest of the population including their families,” said Rathore, adding that India was on the verge of 3rd stage and it was only the citizens’ awareness, which could hold it from getting worse. 

In a similar case, two suspects, who had returned from Italy to their village in Osian, three days back, refused to get themselves screened and shifted to isolation facility in Jodhpur. The SDM had to contact them but still adamant, they had to be isolated at their respective homes. 

This negligence of foreign visitors has been taking the team of Jodhpur Municipal Corporation also to task and the teams have to resort to hard convincing. 

Commissioner (JMC) Suresh Kumar Ola said that close to 200 foreign visitors have been stamped on their hands so far and counting, following the information received from the people about arrival of such persons in the city. 

He admitted that there have been 2-3 instances of resistance by such persons for screening to their teams. “We convinced them into home quarantine, warning them of legal action against them, if they did not cooperate,” said Ola.
