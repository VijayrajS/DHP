Floral art tribute for COVID-19 warriors from June 11 to 13 in Bengaluru
2020-06-20
As a token of appreciation to COVID-19 warriors who are working across India, The Flower Council of India will install floral artworks across namma Bengaluru from June 11 to June 13. These will be available for public view in different landmarks across the city - namely Windsor Manor Circle, Metro Station near Chinnaswamy Stadium, Wilson Garden, Brigade Road, Shivajinagar, Frazer Town, Jayanagar (4th Block Police Station), Whitefield Police station, Anil Kumble Circle and Town Hall. 

Srikanth Kanohi, event planner and florist who has worked on styles for the different installations, says, "Apart from finding unique designs, I had to keep certain things in mind, like the surroundings of the place chosen, the kind of flowers being used - their durability, shape, size and colour."

Also joining the initiative, which was inspired by a similar act in New York, are India Florist Association, the Karnataka Event Management Association, South India Floriculture Association, Cut Flower Growers of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka Horticulture Department, BBMP, Bangalore Flower Growers Association and Karnataka State Exotic Flower Grower & Sellers Association.

The installations are going to be facilitated by six wedding and event planners from the city - Kalidas Raj, Viveck Bharadwaj, Zubair Abdul Waheed, Srikanth Kanohi, Srikanth Sai, Sanober Mannan and Anitha Raj. Florists and growers from the city and neighbouring parts of Karnataka will contribute their floral produce to the initiative for free. 

Zubair says, "Each planner has taken up a different viewpoint to portray as a floral display. My installations will be showcased at Brigade Road, Frazer Town and Shivajinagar. I will install a multifloral cape around different mannequins dressed as policemen, doctors, nurses and more."

Flower Council of India president Srikanth Sai says that they're looking at installing these artworks across India, starting with Bengaluru. "The work that the medical staff, government officials and the state police departments have done is incomparable and we were looking for ways to showcase our gratitude for their hard work and services. When we read about the flower arrangements at streets and landmarks in NYC, we decided to do a similar initiative," he says.
