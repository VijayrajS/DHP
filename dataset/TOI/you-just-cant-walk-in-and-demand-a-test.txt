Coronavirus in Kerala: You just can’t walk in and demand a test
2020-03-15
KOCHI: The state government has already advised people with mild symptoms of Covid-19 not to come to hospitals for testing and treatment. But there are many who are thronging the government hospitals and insist on testing.

Government doctors said that around 25% of the visitors who approach the OP at the isolation wards in government hospitals are those who haven’t travelled abroad or those who aren’t primary or secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients. When doctors on duty try to explain the government guidelines on testing, they insist that it is their right to get tested.

“Ordinary people are swarming hospitals claiming that they have corona. Just like walking into a lab for diabetes test, they walk into the isolation ward’s OP demanding Covid-19 test. They don’t need to rush to the hospital on suspicion but they can call the Disha helpline and take guidance,” said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer (public emergency), currently in charge of anti-Covid-19 effort in the state.

He said that people needn’t go to the hospital if they have common cold. Only those who have returned from abroad or are primary or secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients should go to the hospital. “If too many people come, there are chances of skipping genuine coronavirus cases. Too much of unwanted rush would also result in lapses despite the best efforts of the doctors. This is also essential to minimise community spread,” said Dr Fettle. 

The state government had revised guidelines for testing, quarantine, hospital admission and discharge for Covid-19 on March 12 and said, “Testing is not going to change either the clinical course or management of the patient with mild symptoms”.

 “Despite our best efforts, every day we have five to six ‘normal’ persons walking in to each hospital claiming that they suspect to have Covid-19. While some insist on testing, some leave once they are counselled on the government’s guidelines,” said Dr Joseph Chacko, president, Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association.
