Forest guides seek urgent help to tide over lockdown woes
2020-04-14
Nagpur: With uncertainty looming large over their livelihood because of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and the resultant lockdown, forest guides have demanded immediate help to tide over the financial crisis their families are facing.

Maharashtra Rajya Abhayaranya Guides Union (MRAGU) has appealed to the forest department that their members be accorded assistance similar to what is available for regular employees.

Narendra Wankhede, joint secretary of the union, said closure of parks has impacted forest guides. “There is no other source of income for our members. It’s almost like the life of a daily wager and it depends on the inflow of tourists to the park,” said Wankhede.

The union believes that since the closure of parks is a nationwide thing, they must be taken care of by the department itself. “Our members can be hired by the forest department for some work which will at least keep our homes functioning normally,” he said.

The union, through its members in multiple parks, has urged authorities to take this up on priority. A guide told TOI that government should announce some kind of financial assistance scheme for them.

“We don’t come under below poverty line (BPL) category. Even though it has been announced to provide ration to APL families too, but that’s a very cumbersome process. All government employees are still getting salaries despite there not being any work. Why should we then be deprived of such a facility,” said a guide, who did not wish to be identified.
