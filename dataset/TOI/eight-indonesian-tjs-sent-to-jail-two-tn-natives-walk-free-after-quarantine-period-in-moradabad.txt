BAREILLY: Eight members of Tablighi Jamaat from Indonesia were sent to jail after completing a 28-day quarantine period at Moradabad Institute of Technology (MIT), while two other members hailing from Tamil Nadu walked free late on Wednesday.

Police initiated action against the Jamaatis after they tested negative for novel coronavirus upon completing their quarantine period.

As their quarantine period got over, police on Wednesday took all the 10 Jamaatis into custody in the presence of health department officials and produced them before the remand magistrate. The magistrate sent the eight Indonesian citizens — who were on a visit to India on a tourist visa and had been booked for misusing the visa and also under the provisions of the Epidemic Disease Act — to jail while letting off the two others.

Advocate Vaibhav Agrawal said remand magistrate Raghuvansh Mani Singh granted bail to two Jamaatis from Tamil Nadu, while eight Indonesian were remanded to 14-day police custody.

The two Jamaatis, who were granted bail, are Mohammad Jawed and Sheikh Daud, according to police.

According to circle officer Vishal Yadav, all Jamaatis were arrested from Firdaus mosque in Qureshian locality under Thakurdwara police station limits in Moradabad 28 days ago. They arrived at the mosque on March 11 after attending the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi.

Thus far, 96 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Moradabad district, while nine were cured and discharged, four succumbed to the deadly virus.
