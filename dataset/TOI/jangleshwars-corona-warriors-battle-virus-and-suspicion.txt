Jangleshwar’s corona warriors battle virus and suspicion
2020-04-23
Rajkot: Jangleshwar has become the most dreadful word in Rajkot minds after the area turned into a hotspot for coronavirus with 31 people testing positive of Covid-19 from the area. Therefore, health workers in this area wage a dual battle everyday — one against the virus in the afflicted area and another with their suspicious neighbours. More than the danger of Covid-19 infection, these 19 women health workers of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) now fear the stinging looks and ostracization by their neighbours when they return home from work. “My neighbours keep distance from me, which is good. But they look at me with suspicion, which makes me feel bad,” lamented Chandrika Jadav, an RMC health worker with physical disability, who has to walk for 13 km from her home to Jangleshwar daily as she doesn’t get any vehicle due to the lockdown. Echoes Jyoti Jadav, another co-worker: “The neighbours look at me as if I am ‘corona’ in person! But I react to them with a smiling face. I leave my 82-year-old mother in the care of one my benevolent neighbours and work in Jangleshwar daily. In order to dispel the suspicions of my neighbours, I have undergone Covid-19 test, the report of which has come negative. However, neighbours are still scared of me.” “If we resign to their superstitions, who will work for these people. We have to keep the lamp of faith alight in our hearts,” says Asha Dalwani, another health worker at Jangleshwar.Lauding these women, RMC deputy health officer Manish Chunara says, “These women have proven themselves as corona warriors in a true sense. They have to slog for 12 hours daily, while being away from their families.” “I salute medical officer Shahin Khokhar, lab technician Megha Dhamelia and nurses — Rizwana Mathakia, Rashida Patani, Shital Bhogara, Nayna Makwana and Roshani Pitroda — for their commendable services in Jangleshwar,” Chunara added.
