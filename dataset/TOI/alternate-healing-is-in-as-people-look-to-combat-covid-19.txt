Alternate healing is in as people look to combat Covid-19

Hyderabad: Among those who are frantically turning up at private hospitals on the assumption that they may have Covid-19, only a few are being re-directed to Gandhi Hospital. This was largely seen at hospitals on Wednesday.

“My uncle was turned away from a top private hospital in the morning after he said he may have contracted the coronavirus. Although he had not visited any foreign country, he works in an IT company where some employees were suspected to have similar symptoms. He panicked and we had to make calls to various doctors, including homeopathic and Ayurvedic doctors, to assure him that all is well,” said B Rao, a resident of Mehdipatnam.

Some of the worried people are also approaching alternate healers and psychologists for help as overloaded hospitals turning them away.

Notwithstanding the WHO alert on the possibility of elderly people getting affected psychologically due to the virus scare, patients with psychological disorders were showing heightened symptoms, psychiatrists claimed. A 36-year-old woman patient, who has obsessive compulsive disorder, came back to the clinic this week complaining of repetitive thoughts getting infected with coronavirus. “She even started excessively washing hands specially because this infection spreads via contamination,” said a psychiatrist.

In another case, a 27-year-old software professional, working in Hyderabad and living away from family, sought help as he was constantly worried about the virus symptoms and having thoughts that his family members were getting infected. “He was worried that he is going to lose them. People with pre-existing anxiety have been the most affected psychologically with coronavirus,” said Dr Virinchi Sharma, consultant psychiatrist.
