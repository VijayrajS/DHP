JAISALMER: Curfew was imposed in half of the city from Wednesday morning after three migrant labourers tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday night.


As a precautionary measure, the city’s streets and markets were sanitised throughout the day and police barricades put up in two dozen colonies. Partial curfew was imposed in ward numbers 14, 15, 25 and 26. 

Collector Namit Mehta and SP Kiran Kung inspected the curfew-hit areas and gave necessary directions to officers. The administration on Tuesday night conducted screening of 300 migrants who had come from Pune and Mumbai and took random samples. Concern was raised by people as 300 migrants returned to the city from hotspot areas.

Five migrants tested positive in last two days of which two were from city and three from rural areas. Around 7,500 migrants have returned to Jaisalmer.

The three who tested positive on Tuesday night were from Kheenya village, Bhadasar village and Goyadani pass in the city. On Wednesday, one more corona positive case surfaced, who is a relative of a corona patient. Mehta has appealed to the city’s residents not to panic. He has urged people to not be hostile to the migrants as they are also from Jaisalmer. People have been persuaded to stay at home. 

Cabinet minister Saleh Mohammad has appealed to the people to not get scared and asked them to stay at home. He asked people in curfew-bound areas to stay at home and to help the administration by abiding by the curfew. 

Colonies adjoining the houses of infected persons have been sealed. All movement there has been stopped and ration will be provided through home delivery. If more people are found infected inside the city, then curfew may be extended to entire city.
