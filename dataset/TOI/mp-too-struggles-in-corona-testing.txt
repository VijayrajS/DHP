Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh like other states in India is lagging in Covid-19 testing. Six days after Bhopal reported its first Covid case, the premier institute is still not able to test maximum possible 63 tests per day. 

“Samples come in staggered manner, we have been able to test up to 36 samples in a day,” said AIIMS Bhopal director Dr Sarman Singh. He is one of India’s foremost experts in Clinical Microbiology and Molecular Medicine. Going by numbers the premier institute had about 160 kits, as on Thursday. ICMR provides these kits. A maximum of 63 samples can be run in three shifts at AIIMS Regional Virology Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (RVRDL). “We have made sufficient arrangements but no predictions can be made for the number of diseased, we might encounter,” said AIIMS Bhopal director, Dr Sarman Singh, here on Thursday.

ICMR Jabalpur can test 36 samples each day and similar are the numbers for testing facility at Indore and Gwalior, according to sources. TNN
