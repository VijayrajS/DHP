RAJKOT: The happiness of this bride’s father was shortlived as soon after the band, bajaa and baraat of his daughter, the man had to face cops’ music for not adhering to the lockdown rules. 

The wedding which took place in Bhujodi village of Bhuj taluka on Thursday night was earlier notified by Kishor Bhambhar (55), the father of the bride, as a lowkey affair seeking permission for 50 guests only.



The wedding took place in Bhujodi village of Bhuj on Thursday night.
However, according to the police, when they reached the venue, they found 76 guests instead of the permitted number. “Nobody was wearing mask, nor were the invitees maintaining social distancing. Hence, we booked Bhambhar under the Epidemic Act,” said A N Bhatt, sub-inspector with Bhuj A division police station. 

On the other hand, the wedding of Narendrasinh Zala’s son Harshvardhan with Rishirajsinh Chudasma’s daughter Ishwar in Jamnagar was perfect to a tee. With only about 20 people including state minister, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, participated in the event, all rules were maintained including social distancing, masks et al. 

What’s more, even the bridegroom and the priest too didn’t let their masks down for rituals, said an official from Jamnagar district administration.
