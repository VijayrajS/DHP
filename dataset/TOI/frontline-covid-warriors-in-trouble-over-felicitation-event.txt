After the incident came to light, municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani, said, “The frontline staff at hospitals, sanitation workers, police and other people engaged in essential services are doing their best and we must appreciate their work. But this is not the right time to organize such functions as Covid-19 is highly infectious and we have stall its further spread. You can pray for best health of corona warriors from bottom of your heart.”

Furthermore, people also forget to maintain social distancing while welcoming those Covid-19 patients who have recovered successfully and returned their homes. “We should applaud their fightback by maintaining social distancing,’’ SMC said in a statement.
