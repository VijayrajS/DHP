NEW DELHI: All India Institute of Medical Sciences attended to over 12,000 patients at its emergency or casualty facility and performed 2,641 major and minor surgeries between March 25 and May 31—when the country was under lockdown due to Covid-19 outbreak. 

The hospital, authorities said, also provided 55,000 tele-consultations to follow-up patients to reduce the need for them to visit the facility. 

“As far as Covid-19 treatment is concerned, 2,301 admissions were recorded at its Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre and National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar,” AIIMS spokesperson Dr Aarti Vij said.

On an average, Vij said, around 800 coronavirus-infected patients were admitted to the AIIMS daily.

“The hospital has been at the forefront in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic providing treatment to infected individuals at its two dedicated facilities (Trauma Centre and NCI) for the last two months. However, non-Covid patients are also being attended to with equal importance,” Vij said.

Also, around 1,800 Covid-19 and non-coronavirus patients were provided dialysis during this period, the AIIMS spokesperson added. She said that 11,218 AIIMS employees, including medical, para-medical, office and other support staff, were trained on infection control practices after the onset of the pandemic.

“Various information, education and communication (IEC) activities have been undertaken at the institute for spreading awareness about Covid-19 and training for capacity building,” Dr Vij added.

Around 40 videos on various topics, such as ‘Stay Home and Stay Safe’, hydroxychloroquine and Covid-19, and stigma related to the infection, have been uploaded on the website of AIIMS and health ministry.
