LUCKNOW: The test report of an 81-year-old retired railways employee who died on Sunday due to urinary infection came back positive for novel coronavirus infection on Monday night. 

He is the seventh victim of Covid-19 in the city. Six of them, including him, didn’t even know that they was suffering from the disease, an indication that infection is silently spreading its tentacles. 

A resident of Ruchi Khand in Shardanagar, the deceased had been admitted to Northern Railway hospital in Alambagh on Sunday for a urinary infection. He died within hours. He had no symptoms of Covid-19. However, since it is mandatory to test all those who come for treatment, his samples were sent for the test, doctors said. 

The body was handed over to the family for last rites as per Covid-19 protocol after the report arrived.

All seven people who lost the battle with Covid-19 were elderly and had comorbidities. Two each died of brain haemorrhage and silent hypoxaemia (extremely low blood oxygen level), while acute respiratory syndrome, kidney ailment and urinary issue claimed one life each. The first death took place on April 16 and the remaining six within a span of 10 days from May 28 to June 7. 

“As soon as we came to know about the railway hospital case on Tuesday, samples of all seven family members, including his wife, two sons, a daughter-in-law and three granddaughters were sent for test on Tuesday, said additional chief medical officer A Raja. 

“The family was distraught hence not much information could be extracted about the source of infection and contact tracing. However, once the reports of their samples are received, we will talk to them again,” he added.
