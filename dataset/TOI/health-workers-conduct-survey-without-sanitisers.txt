Coronavirus scare: Health workers conduct survey without sanitisers in Aurangabad
2020-03-27
AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has failed to provide hygiene items such as masks and hand sanitisers to members of teams carrying out door-to-door surveys to identify people with symptoms of Covid-19 or travel history.


The health teams comprise nurses and healthcare workers. 

The teams have been tasked with identifying suspect cases and carrying out primary screening of persons with symptoms such as cough, cold or fever. They are to refer these individuals to health authorities. 

Lack of hand sanitisers has the potential to make these teams vulnerable to infection. It was revealed that the healthcare workers use scarves or handkerchiefs to cover their mouth or nose. 

Activist Rahul Ingle of the Shahar Parivartan Aghadi said the teamsâ€™ members have to be equipped with such items to protect them from the viral infection.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the AMC has not been able to buy enough hand sanitiser because of a shortage in the market. 

State food and drug administration minister Rajendra Shingne has asked manufacturers of hand sanitisers to increase production. The manufacturing of such items is permitted even during the lockdown. 

Meanwhile, Eurolife Healthcare Pvt Ltd., a pharmaceutical company has donated sanitisers worth Rs 1.5 crore to deputy district collector of Aurangabad. The collectorate issued a statement that the sanitisers would be distributed to government establishments.
