2020-05-11
Visakhapatnam: Vizianagaram district administration has decided to increase the number of people being tested and carry out random testing, especially in places with community and primary health centres. The district, which was a green zone till recently, reported four Covid-19 cases earlier this month. Sources in the district health department said they expected an increased number of rapid testing kits in the next few days to cover the enhanced sample base.

District collector M Hari Jawhar Lal said, “We are taking certain proactive measures such as random testing of vendors in all the major towns and pnachayats of the district along with improving the conditions in the quarantine centres.”

Quarantine centres in the district have proved to be a source of worry, with three different centres reporting three cases. The administration is on the lookout for quarantine centres with attached toilets and is planning to build temporary additional toilets if required.

District medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr SV Ramani Kumari said, “We are training staff from PHCs and CHCs to help in the sampling-testing process, so that the pace of sampling can be increased.”

Joint collector GC Kishore Kumar said, “Our agenda is to increase the sample base and gather as many samples from diferent parts of the district. The vigil has to be tightened.” On the random testing of vendors in the district, the joint collector said the focus would be on main municipalities and major pachayats.
