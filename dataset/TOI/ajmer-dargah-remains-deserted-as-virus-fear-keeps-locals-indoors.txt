2020-05-26
AJMER: The Jannati Darwaza at the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishty was opened on Monday, on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. But perhaps for the first time in the history of Ajmer dargah, not a single devotee was present to offer prayers on the occasion. 

The Muslim community here celebrated the occasion of Eid at home and wished each other through social media. The special namaz conducted at the eidgah situated at Kaserganj was cancelled. 

Since the last 64 days, the dargah is closed in the wake of the pandemic. During the festival of Eid, about 1 lakh devotees from different places gather and participate in the special prayers. On Monday, khadims of the dargah offered prayers for the unity of the nation as well as for the spirit to fight against Covid-19. From last 30 days, the Muslim community have been fasting and offered prayers at home. No shopping and public gatherings were seen to celebrate the festival. The khadims said that they understand that at a time like this, staying indoors is best as the virus can cost them their lives. As mass meals could not be held, many shared delicacies like the sewaiya on social media with a promise to eat together after the lockdown is lifted completely. 

Muslim leaders appealed to everyone to remain at home and celebrate Eid indoors. The dargah region is still under curfew and police officials said that people in the dargah region cooperated with them.
