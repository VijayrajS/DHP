Lucknow: State health department officials said, Aarogya Setu app alerts were being followed up earnestly by surveillance teams.

“At least 2,723 alerts on suspected Covid-19 cases in the state were generated by the app. District-specific data was forwarded to chief medical officers, who swiftly acted on cues and took samples. As many as 10 coronavirus positive persons have been identified through the app,” said principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. 

Health officials informed while some were isolated, those who tested negative have been asked to follow isolation protocols for next two weeks.

Aarogya Setu app is a state-of-the-art smart phone application that unites people across India in a resolute fight against covid-19. “It enables people to assess themselves on the risk of infection. The calculation is based on interaction with others using cutting-edge bluetooth technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence,” said an officer in the state surveillance team.

“The easy and user-friendly app detects other devices that come in the proximity of that phone. It can calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts tested positive,” an official release said.

Recently concerns were raised about security of the user’s information, but government officials claimed personal data collected by the app is encrypted with state-of-the-art technology and stays secure on the phone till it’s needed for facilitating medical intervention. 

Available in 11 languages, the Aarogya Setu App is ready for pan-India use from day 1 and has highly scalable architecture.
