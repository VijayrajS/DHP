JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday demanded that test kits and other equipment to treat coronavirus patients be procured by a central agency and distributed to the states. He said centralised procurement would save the states a lot of time.

The chief minister was interacting with a five-member team of the Centre visiting the state through video-conference on Tuesday. Gehlot raised the issue of migrant labourers, demanded a relief package from the Centre to all the states and aid for reviving business and ensuring social security of people. Gehlot apprised the team of the precarious financial condition of the state and demanded that the Centre announce a package for the affected states. “The state government had put in all its resources in the fight against the pandemic and the lockdown has dried up all its resources,” Gehlot said.

He said the RBI had increased ways and means advance to 60% but is not interest free. He demanded that such advance should be made interest free. 

The chief minister demanded a three months’ moratorium on debts of the state government from central financial institutions.
