Vijayawada: With 1,91,874 Covid-19 tests, AP has conducted more number of tests till date than 27 other countries in the world, including Qatar (1.27 lakh tests), Indonesia (1.13 lakh) and Thailand (97,000), said KS Jawahar Reddy, special chief secretary (medical, health and family welfare), on Tuesday. 

The new challenge for the state now is the arrival of migratory workers and stranded students, tourists and pilgrims. “Nearly 8,000 people from several states having high disease incidence like Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat have returned in the last few days. We are also focusing on testing people aged above 50 years,” he added. TNN
