2020-06-14
INDORE: Expecting a surge in Covid-19 cases in next one month, district administration has decided to carryout second phase of an extensive door-to-door survey to examine health of locals. Relaxations granted in lockdown can however pose problems before the survey team in screening of working professionals.

According to senior administrative officials, there are around 370 anganwadi centres, which will each cover about 350 houses of their respective area. Besides, there are about 600 Asha workers in district and each of them will also cover around 350 houses of their respective areas.

“Remaining households will be covered by ANM workers and if needed, government school teachers of the area will be roped in to the survey work,” zila panchayat CEO Rohan Saxena told TOI.

He added that it will be an extensive door-to-door survey, in which, health details including comorbidity of the person will be noted. “Apart from identification of suspected Covid patients and ensuring to provide them required treatment, the team will take regular follow up of patients while a control room will be monitoring the same,” he said.

Saxena added that the survey is likely to start in city from Tuesday and it will be extended into rural areas.

Before starting survey, collector Manish Singh on Saturday held a meeting of revenue, IMC and health department officials and asked them to work in coordination. He also instructed members of the survey teams and Rapid Response Team (RRT) to take the work assigned to them very seriously. 

“Examination of contact history of Covid-19 patients is necessary while samples should be taken of all the persons, who come in contact of positive patients,” said Singh adding that fever clinics are yielding very good results and if any patient is tested positive there, they should be immediately admitted in hospital of red-category for treatment.
