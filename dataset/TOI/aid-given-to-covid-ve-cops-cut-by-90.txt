Aid given to Covid positive Delhi cops cut by 90%
2020-05-22
NEW DELHI: With more number of police personnel getting infected with the novel coronavirus, Delhi Police has decided to reduce the amount being given to the positive cops by 90%. Now, a Covid-19 positive cop will get just Rs 10,000, instead of Rs one lakh as announced earlier.


Senior officers, however, said that Delhi Police would continue to bear medical expenses of the infected cops. Around 300 police officers have tested positive for the coronavirus so far.

Meanwhile, the amount for police officers who die on duty due to Covid-19 has been increased from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.

The decisions were taken at a recent meeting.

“If any police officer gets infected, we make all efforts to ensure that they heal fast. We even ensure that their families are doing fine. Senior police officers have been asked to facilitate their hospital admissions and cater to other needs,” a senior policeman told TOI on Thursday.

Until recently, the money from the police welfare fund was being used for various measures which are being implemented for the cops who get affected from novel coronavirus.

Sources said that the proposal to set up a separate Covid fund had also been approved. It would have around Rs 4 crore which might be used for the medical and other expenses of the police officers on duty. From senior officers to the constabulary level, everyone would contribute to the fund. Even the multi-tasking staff members would contribute around Rs 200 towards the special fund.
