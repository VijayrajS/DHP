PILIBHIT: A 24-year-old youth, who had returned to his native place in Neuria town with four colleagues during the lockdown from Chhattisgarh, where he worked as a cycle mechanic, died on Thursday evening, minutes after he was admitted to Neuria community health center (CHC).


His family said the youth was suffering from high fever with respiratory congestion since Thursday morning. They also alleged that Dr Dinesh, who was on duty at the CHC, declined to attend to him from fear of transmission of Covid-19. The youth died 15 minutes after they reached the CHC, the family claimed.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Seema Agarwal, said the health department had been informed that the youthâ€™s family already reported that he had been vomiting, following which, he had been shifted to the CHC on a government ambulance.

She said the administration will send his body for autopsy to identify the cause of death. His family demanded that the youth be tested for Covid-19, which, the CMO has clarified, is not possible during autopsy.

On being asked if the youth had been quarantined after his return, additional chief medical officer Dr C M Chaturvedi said he and his four colleagues had been duly screened for novel coronavirus at the time, when none of them had shown any symptoms, as a result of which they had been recommended home quarantine.

But apprehensive of the youth having died of Covid-19, the department has now decided to send samples of nasal and throat swabs of all his four colleagues for testing, said Chaturvedi.

Neuria police station SHO Kheem Singh Jalal said the dead body has been sent to the mortuary of the district government hospital, Pilibhit, where his autopsy wil be conducted on Friday.
