PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that the 66 Goan seafarers, who disembarked from Marella Discovery, have tested negative for Covid-19. He said that reports of seafarers from Karnika and Angriya are awaited. The tests were conducted at Mumbai.

Sawant said that the 66 Goan crew members from Marella Discovery will leave for Goa on Sunday. There are 93 Goans on board Karnika and 23 on Angriya, he said.

The chief minister said that the state government has told the seafarers’ agents as well as the ship owners that they can look out for hotels in Goa at discounted rates. 

He added that the government will finalise the same hotel as a quarantine facility for the seafarers. “They don’t have to pay the government anything,” he said.

Sawant said that either the agents or ship owner should confirm that the hotel has a proper housekeeping setup and that food is available. “In case they want to opt for a hotel hired by the state government to quarantine their crew, then we have told the agents to pay between Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per room per day as a subsidised rate,” the chief minister told reporters.

Sawant said that the state government would also collect swab samples at the Keri and Patradevi checkposts.

He said that people should not use surgical face masks as they will be unable to dispose the same scientifically after use. “People should use homemade facemasks. Self-help groups have made 10,000 face masks so that they can be made available to the public at a reasonable price,” Sawant said.

He said that 5,933 foreign nationals have been evacuated through 30 special flights to various countries. Municipalities and panchayats have given permission to allow completion of house repairs and construction works, Sawant said.
