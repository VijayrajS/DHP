UTTARKASHI: A much-mellowed version of the annual Char Dham Yatra began on Sunday, with the opening of portals of the Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines after six-month-long winter break on the auspicious occasion of Akshay Tritiya here in Uttarkashi district.


Amid strict lockdown guidelines, priests opened the portals of Gangotri shrine, which is dedicated to goddess Ganga at shubh muhurat (auspicious timing) of 12.35 pm, whereas gates of Yamunotri temple, dedicated to goddesses Yamuna, was opened at 12.41 pm in the presence of selected people.

Earlier, the ceremonial palanquin of goddesses Ganga reached Gangotri town on Sunday morning after night stay at Bhairav temple. On arrival of the palanquin, priests opened the gates and set up the idol inside the temple. After this, priests offered the first prayer on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and wished for his success in fight against Covid-19 pandemic.

On the other hand, the palanquin of goddesses Yamuna accompanied by her brother lord Shani ‘Someshwar Devta’ left her winter abode Kharsali village and reached Yamunotri shrine by afternoon, where priests opened the gates of the temple after offering special prayers.

Suresh Semwal, president of Gangotri temple committee and Kriteshwar Uniyal, secretary of Yamunotri temple committee said, “Apart from selected priests, no pilgrims and devotees will be allowed to visit the shrine, until further directions. We are hoping that soon the Covid-19 crisis gets over and the government starts the Char Dham Yatra, which is the backbone of the state’s economy.”
