Bihar: Business of private hospitals hit in lockdown
2020-05-20
PATNA: Travel curbs leading to fall in the number of patients and additional expenses on protective gears owing to Covid-19 adversely affected the income of private hospitals and diagnostic centres in the state capital during the lockdown since March 25. 

Indian Medical Association (Bihar) general secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said several private hospitals and clinics have sustained up to 80% revenue losses. “Leading private hospitals still receive few patients, but the situation is bad for the remaining health facilities. Besides, purchase of medical and protective equipment to ensure safety in the hospital led to loss in businesses,” he said.

Dr Rajesh Singh, ICU incharge at a private hospital in Alamganj area, said the running cost has increased while the revenue collection dropped by 90%. “We are not getting any government aid to purchase protective gears. Now, we are giving PPE kit to all our employees,” he said.

Dr Sudhir Kumar, who owns a private hospital on Bypass road, said most of their patients are from middle or lower income group. “Some are not coming to hospital out of fear and some due to financial problem,” he said.

The small, standalone nursing homes and hospitals are finding it difficult to run the institutions due to burden of rent and other expenses.

Dr Ghanshyam, who runs a private clinic at Kankarbagh, said, “I have to pay the rent, electricity bill and other miscellaneous charges. Besides, there are other expenses like staff salary, purchase of medical equipment and protective gears. How will we manage all these things?”

Dr BB Bharti, director of a private hospital in Khemnichak area, said most of the patients come from the neighbouring districts. “Due to lockdown, only few patients are coming. If such a situation continues, it would be difficult to run the hospital with so many employees,” he said.
