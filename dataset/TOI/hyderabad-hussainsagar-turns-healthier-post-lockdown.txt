Hyderabad: Hussainsagar turns healthier post lockdown
2020-04-28
HYDERABAD: The Hussainsagar has become less polluted post lockdown, according to data analysed by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). A report released on Monday said the water body was healthier on all parameters.


The lake had been sampled at nine sampling locations on five days over four months from January to April. Post lockdown, monitoring was carried out on April 10 and 16.

The results showed that the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) has increased and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) has decreased. Faecal coliform too has shown a decreasing trend. When contacted officials said it would take a few days to provide more details of the report. 

BOD, along with DO levels, are crucial in determining water quality as based on this one can determine whether a water body is capable of sustaining aquatic life. As per parameters set by Central Pollution Control Board, BOD levels in a water body should be at a maximum of 3mg/l. The reverse holds true for dissolved oxygen where values should ideally be at least 4mg/l or above. 

The lake is monitored every month to assess the water quality of the lake at nine locations in and around the lake. Sample of the lake at Buddha statue was not collected during lockdown period as there was no access to the location. 

The board said: “The improvement in water quality could be due to arrest of human activities like boating, recreation, eateries (not functioning) around the lake.” The state had taken-up the remediation of Hussainsagar Lake which started again this year on March 3 after a gap.
