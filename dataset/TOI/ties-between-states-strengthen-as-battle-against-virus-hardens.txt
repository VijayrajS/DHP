Ties between states strengthen as battle against coronavirus hardens
2020-04-01
HYDERABAD: The fight against coronavirus has improved inter-state relations as top officials along with chief ministers of the respective states are cooperating with each other and taking steps to help the cause of each state in the interests of the people. 


Telangana depends on West Bengal for supply of gunny bags to store paddy and rice. With a super bumper crop of 1.05 crore metric tonnes of paddy expected in Rabi season from the first week of April, Telangana is faced with huge shortage of gunny bags. As on date, Telangana has 35 lakh gunny bags, but as per official estimation, it would need another 35 lakh to 40 lakh gunny bags in view of the expected 1.05 crore metric tonnes of paddy. As the gunny bag manufacturing plants in West Bengal have shut due to the lockdown, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and chief secretary Somesh Kumar have taken up the matter with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to ensure supply of gunny bags. 

A few days ago, Mamata Banerjee had requested KCR and chief ministers of other states to take care of the workers from West Bengal and ensure that they do not face food shortage. 

Similarly, governments of Telangana and Bihar are also in touch with each other over requirement of workers for loading and unloading of paddy and rice in Telangana. The chief minister had announced that he will speak to the Centre and arrange for special trains if needed to bring back labourers from Bihar. 

Over 95% of the total workers involved in loading and unloading of rice bags at rice mills and godowns in Telangana are from Bihar, but a majority of these workers who went home for Holi could not return.
