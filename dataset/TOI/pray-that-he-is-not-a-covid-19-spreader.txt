2020-05-16
COIMBATORE: A 22-year-old guest worker was stopped from boarding train to Odisha on Friday morning as he was suffering from slight breathlessness. His temperature was, however normal at 98 degree Celsius. He was taken to ESI Hospital, where he will be tested for Covid-19 and treated.

On Thursday, TOI had caught a guest worker recording a temperature of 102 degree Celsius on camera. But in a complete disregard for the efforts to contain the spread of novel coronavirus, he was allowed to board a Shramik train. Health officials, however, dismissed it as an error in reading. The 11th Shramik special train, meanwhile, departed from the city railway junction with 1,464 guest workers at 9.45am on Friday. The train is expected to reach Palashur in Odisha at 7.45pm on Saturday. The train will have two stops in Odisha â€“ at Rayagada around 7am and Balangir at 10.40am.

The train with 24 coaches carried only the passengers who were cleared by the district administration after a detailed health check-up. They were allowed inside the station building only after they were thermal screened for temperature. Their hands were sanitized, and their luggage were completely disinfected under the monitoring of state health department and railway authorities.
