NASHIK: The proposed 1,000-bed quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients at Millat Nagar in Malegaon has been shelved by the local civic body after strong opposition by some political parties. 

The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) had decided to raise the 1,000-bed quarantine facility in the town considering the possible spike of coronavirus cases. The facility was to be raised on the lines of the one being raised at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai. 

According to MMC officials, Malegaon has 22 Covid Care Centres besides the dedicated centres where critical patients are treated. 

“The facility was being prepared to bring maximum Covid-19 services under a single roof thus ensuring that everybody receives fair treatment and facilities. But,after much opposition from some political parties, the plan has been shelved,” a senior official from the corporation said on the condition of anonymity. 

“The facility would have brought all the coronavirus-related services under one roof. But, since the proposal was met with strong criticism, the municipal commissioner has decided to halt the project at this point of time,” sources in the civic body said.
