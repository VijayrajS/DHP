Gandhinagar: Although the state government has been attempting to rope in private hospitals to take up Covid-19 patients, only three hospitals of Ahmedabad have come forward.

On Monday, government issued approval to three hospitals — Sterling Cancer Hospital, Satellite; HCG hospital, Mithakhali and Narayana Multi-Speciality Hospital, Rakhial for admission and treatment of Covid-19 patients.

The approved private hospitals said their infrastructure and expertise will help citizens in the war against Covid-19.

“We have created a separate Covid-19 OPD, emergency and isolation rooms for suspected and positive coronavirus cases. The hospital is fully equipped to treat patients with Covid-19,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, regional director at HCG Group of Hospitals, Gujarat. 

Abhijit CP, facility director, Narayana Multispecialty Hospital, said that they had started training doctors and nursing staff about Covid-19 much before the first case was recorded in Gujarat. “The only difference for the medical staff will be to work with protective gears such as PPE kits. At the moment, we have 13 beds which could also be used for critical patients,” he said, adding that isolation zone has been created in the hospital for the purpose.

Namisha Gandhi, vice-president, Sterling Hospitals, said that the state government had sought data on the trained doctors, staff and infrastructure. “We have assigned Sterling Sindhu Bhavan for Covid-19 patients so that there is no chance of cross-infection in other patients. We have about 45 beds along with a 10-bed ICU with ventilators for the purpose,” she said, adding that Dr Atul Patel, who is advisor to the state government for Covid-19, on their panel.

“We will be following the international protocols where the staff will be working in six-hour shifts for seven days and then will go into isolation for next seven days,” she said.
