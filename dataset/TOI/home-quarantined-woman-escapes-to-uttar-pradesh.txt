Nagpur: A woman, who returned from Sharjah in UAE and was home quarantined for 14 days, has allegedly fled to her hometown in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh. This is reportedly the first case of a person fleeing from home quarantine in the city. 

She has been booked under the Indian Epidemic Acts as well as for causing risk to others under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The provisions, under which she has been booked, can lead to a jail term. This is also the second such case in which a person has been booked for causing risk to others as part of the corona prevention action. 

According to a press release issued by the police, the woman who returned from Sharjah was quarantined for 14 days. However, when the police reached her residence to confirm that she was indeed at home, It was learnt that she left for Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh. She reached India on March 15.

Coincidentally, the person who has been booked, has her residence under the Sonegaon police station which also covers the home of a Germany returned student. The neighbours had filed a complaint that the German returned girl was seen roaming outside. However, no offence has been registered against her. 

Based on the complaint when the NMC officials reached her residence, the girl was found at home. However, the officials later took her to the MLA Hostel quarantine facility where the doctors said that since it has been 10 days since her return, she cannot be taken in. 

On Tuesday, the Germany returned girl was reported to be at home. Her neighbour Rama Mahesh, who had taken up the matter with the police, also confirmed that the girl was at home on Tuesday. Mahesh said she had approached the police because she was seen moving around during the quarantine period. The complaint was filed as a last resort.
