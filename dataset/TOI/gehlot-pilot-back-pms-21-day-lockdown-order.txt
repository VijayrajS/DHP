“I am happy that Rajasthan was the first state to declare a complete lockdown. I support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of a 21-day lockdown. Together we must fight it and defeat it,” Gehlot said in a tweet.

“#COVID19 is one of the greatest challenges in our times & we all need to be extra cautious to surmount this challenge. I urge all of you to stay indoors & follow the instructions of the government. True spirit of service to the nation is in doing what is best for everyone,” tweeted deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.

“I support the PM’s decision to implement a 21-day lockdown across India. Rajasthan was among the first states to implement a lockdown. We will ensure that public is not put to inconvenience during this period & essentials are supplied,” Pilot added.

The chief minister emphasised there was no time regulation on shops or business establishments and directed police to ensure trucks carrying essential items not disrupted. He said there is no ban on purchase of wheat from the market. Only procurement process of wheat at support price is stopped.
