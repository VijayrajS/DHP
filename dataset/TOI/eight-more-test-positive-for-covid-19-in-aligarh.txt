Agra: Eight more persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Aligarh on Wednesday, taking the tally in the district to 32. 

Talking to TOI, chief development officer (CDO) Anunay Jha said two of the infected persons are the husband and 5-year-old nephew of a pregnant woman from Hathipul, who had earlier tested positive. The other six, including a teenager, are all males and hail from the same area. 

He added that Hathipul has now been declared a hotspot and only healthcare and sanitation staff will be allowed in, while essential items will be home delivered. He further said that a 15-year-old girl from Etah has also been tested positive while being admitted at AMU’s JNMC.

Meanwhile, two more persons from Mathura tested positive, including a 24-year-old woman who is the wife of an advocate, and 60-year-old man who had gone to Metro Hospital in Faridabad for a check-up.

Mathura CMO Sher Singh said after being diagnosed for Covid-19, the man returned to Mathura and was admitted to KD Medical College. However, the CMO did not include the patient’s name in Mathura’s covid tally, as “he was diagnosed in Faridabad”. The total number of positive patients in the district is now 14, he said.

“A total of 1,047 samples have been tested so far. Of these, 733 were found negative and reports of 289 are awaited.
