Pune: A day after their institutional quarantine ended, members of the Wadhawan family and their personal staff were shifted from Panchgani and put under a 14-day home isolation at their farmhouse in Mahabaleshwar on Thursday.

DFHL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, who are among those quarantined, are facing multiple cases registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Yes Bank loan scam case.

The Wadhawans were quarantined after they travelled from Khandala in Pune to Mahabaleshwar amid the lockdown on April 8. Satara superintendent of police Tejaswini Satpute told TOI the home quarantine order was issued by the district magistrate under the Disaster Management Act. 

Meanwhile, also on Thursday, Justice Ajay Gadkari of Bombay high court directed Kapil to file a reply to EDâ€™s petition for cancellation of interim bail granted by a trial court in a money laundering case involving the late drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi. 

In an other development, ED opposed their anticipatory bail pleas in the Yes Bank case. 

The Wadhawans had submitted the pleas on Wednesday. The court has adjourned the hearing to Monday and said their interim protection from arrest will continue until then.
