Coronavirus scare in Pune: Cops impose shutdown on Fashion Street market
2020-03-16
PUNE: The Cantonment police on Sunday issued a notice under the Maharashtra Police (MP) Act, imposing a shutdown of all shops and establishments in the popular Fashion Street market area till March 31 in view of the Covid-19 situation. 

The notice, issued by assistant police inspector Harish Shilamkar under Section 68 of the MP Act, also warns of legal action against establishments found in violation. A copy of the notice has been sent to MG Hawkers and Pathari Seva Sanstha (MGHPSS).

“The police should have got interim stay from the court to close down the market. How can they send notice arbitrarily? We are going to challenge it in court on Monday. We fail to understand why such a notice has only been given to us. We strongly feel that the police and cantonment want to close the market permanently under this garb,” said advocate AV Akolkar, president of MGHPSS.

About 600 shops make up the market, considered one of the most crowded places in Pune Camp. 

“We are considering all measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus in the cantonment limit. We are soon going to take action against street hawkers as they do not have necessary measures in place. As far as closure of the market is concerned, the district administration has taken the decision and directed us to implement it. Accordingly, we have sent the notice,” said inspector Chandrakant Bhosale of Cantonment police station. 

The police have also decided to survey Shivaji Market on Tuesday. “If we find the place dirty and crowded, we will prefer to close it for few days until the situation improves,” Bhosale added.
