Telangana bullying doctors amid Covid-19: BJP
2020-06-09
HYDERABAD: The chief of Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party, Bandi Sanjay Kumar, on Monday alleged that the state government is threatening the doctors and healthcare workers if they conduct Covid-19 tests. 


Addressing a press conference on Monday, Kumar said that doctors in the state-run hospitals are at the receiving end of apathy as the government is refusing to conduct tests and is asking them to attend to their patients despite having symptoms of Covid-19. 

He also alleged that state is hiding Covid-19 details in the bulletins. Stating that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) never asked the state to test less number of people, he said: “The state government has to be transparent.”
