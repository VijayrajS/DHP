Amid Covid links, pangolins bear brunt of human greed
2020-05-28
BHOPAL: Pangolins may be the prime suspect to have passed coronavirus from bats to humans; but in Madhya Pradesh, people continue poaching this threatened species for consumption.

 If that is not enough, they are also subjected to extreme cruelty as they are thrown alive in boiling water for removing scales to be sold in the black market to global syndicates. On Tuesday, MP forest department arrested three people with 15 kg pangolin scales in coordination with wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB).

WCCB and special task force (STF) Jabalpur seized 15.70 kilo of pangolin scales that were being carried in a scooty and a motorcycle. Accused Nauman Rangrez, Mohammed Naeem Quraisi of Budhar and Alok Singh of Umaria district were arrested from near a bus stand in Shahdol district. Alok Singh is said to be linked with other people involved in the trade. Rangrez and Naeem used to collect scales from poachers directly. Officials say more people involved are on their radar.

Special task force (STF) of the wildlife wing of Madhya Pradesh forest department has arrested nearly 200 people cracking the biggest international network with arrests from faraway states. Interpol’s help was also being sought in many cases. Pangolin scales which are a rage in China for its aphrodisiac properties are now hot property in party circuits of America.

Officials claim there are two smuggling routes to China — Nepal through north Bengal and Myanmar through Manipur. Local poachers are paid Rs 6,000 for scales of an ant-eater, which weighs around 1.3 to 2 kg. It is resold for Rs 15,000 to middlemen and Rs 30,000 to those who export the animal. In international market, it fetches 30 times more than poachers get as their cut.
