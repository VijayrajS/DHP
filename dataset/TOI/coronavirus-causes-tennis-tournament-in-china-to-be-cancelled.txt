XI'AN: A tennis tournament scheduled for next month in China was cancelled by the women's professional tour because of concerns over a deadly viral outbreak.


The WTA announced Thursday that it was calling off the Xi'an Open "due to the coronavirus outbreak."

The hard-court event was supposed to be held April 13-19, with 32 singles players and 16 doubles teams. There would have been $115,000 in prize money at stake.

A statement issued by the WTA said the tour is "watching the situation closely" and will "continue to communicate with medical experts as information evolves on this virus."
