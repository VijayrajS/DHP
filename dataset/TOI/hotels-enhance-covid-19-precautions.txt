Ahmedabad: With reports of a spike in coronavirus infection not just in the Far East but also in Europe, several hotels in Ahmedabad have initiated proactive precautions as they host vistors from abroad. 

While some have displayed advisories at receptions, others have implemented protocols to ensure staffers maintain proper personal hygiene.

“We have displayed an advisory at the reception and restaurants with messages on preventing coronavirus spread and are also displaying the helpline number at the reception. Masks are also available on request,” said Rahul Mehta, director, sales and marketing, Novotel Ahmedabad.

“At the time of checking-in, we are advising guests who are feeling unwell to seek medical assistance at the in-house doctor,” said Sandeepan Bosh, general manager, Radisson Blu Ahmedabad.
