Visakhapatnam: With the outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19) creating a scare across the world and speculation about the virus originating in meat markets, consumption of non-vegetarian food has gone down in the city.

Chicken vendor Shaik Babaji of AS Saleem Poultry at Akkayyapalem said that while the poultry would sell nearly 1,500kg broiler chicken on a given Sunday, they did not even cross the 500kg mark last Sunday. “On Friday, we could not even sell 50kg, against our target of 300kg,” he added.

Arijili Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation said the panic over coronavirus has an impact on fish trade as well. “Some of our vendors are even offering discounts on fish products,” Dasu added.

T Satyannarayana, honorary president of Andhra Pradesh Hotels’ Association said the scare is affecting restaurants serving non-vegetarian food. “The impact is not only limited to us. Even vendors who eke out a living on non-vegetarian food are being affected,” he said. 

Doctors and experts however say that there is no problem in consuming non-vegetarian food provided that it is cooked properly.

Speaking to TOI, S Tirupati Rao, Visakhapatnam district medical and health officer said, “We have not received any instruction from the government about not consuming non-vegetarian food. If any warnings come up, we will alert through proper channels.”

Nala Maharaju, estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar said the demand for vegetables has gone up and government departments have started reaching out to wholesale vegetable vendors in Odisha and Telangana for additional stock.
