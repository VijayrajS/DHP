JAIPUR: Despite donations to Chief Minister Relief Fund Covid-19 Mitigation Fund not coming under CSR activity, several companies are either making donations or taking up social work to help people during the pandemic.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, on Friday announced to to donate Rs 5 crore to the CM relief fund. The National Engineering Industries, which sells bearings under the brand name of NBC, has donated Rs 1.30 crore, while Suravi Charitable Trust has committed Rs 1 crore. The trust has contributed Rs 21 lakh to PM Cares fund and pledged to spend the rest of the amount to undertake relief work in Rajasthan like paying school fees of 1,000 needy children and giving free medicines to the poor in remote villages of Bikaner.

Similarly, CII has committed to provide 10,000 face shields free-of-cost to the state government. Udaipur-based Narayan Seva Sansthan that runs charitable hospitals across the country has formed a ‘Corona Relief Force’ comprising 50 people to take care of distribution of food and essentials among the needy.

However, a senior official in the state government clarified that the donations to CM fund should qualify for CSR activity and that the order of corporate affairs ministry clarifying that the donations are not covered under CSR is wrong.
