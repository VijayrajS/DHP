Local legislator Dr Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy, revenue divisional officer (RDO) Venkateswaralu along with municipal and police officials inspected the area and cordoned off the neighbouring colonies. The areas adjacent to Varavakatta including Ramireddipeta were declared as red zones. The locals were directed not to venture out until further instructions.

According to information, the victim approached Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur, citing breathing trouble 10 days ago. He was shifted to the ID hospital for Covid-19 treatment. The district administration has put all the staff who treated the patient at ID hospital on quarantine.

Meanwhile, the officials are trying to find out how the victim contracted Covid-19 and from whom. He had not left the town in the last one month.
