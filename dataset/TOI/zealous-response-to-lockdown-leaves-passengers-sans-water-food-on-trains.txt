Vijayawada: Zealous response to lockdown leaves passengers sans water, food on trains
2020-03-24
VIJAYAWADA: While the Indian Railways has cancelled all passenger trains from March 22 to 31, citizens on the trains which started before the stipulated period are facing a lot of difficulties. On Sunday, during the janta curfew, Vijayawada, which is the fourth busiest railway station in the country, wore a deserted look. 


Some trains did not even have a pantry car, such as the Mumbai-bound Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Express. 

Speaking to TOI, K Aravind, a passenger heading to Chennai on the Tamil Nadu Express explained most of the passengers were mainly looking for a bottle of water. According to Vijayawada division officials, both the Rail Dhaba and Comesum food courts have been shut and only take away is being allowed for the time being. Despite there being fewer trains running, demand has fallen. Many passengers either didn’t turn up or cancelled their tickets thanks to the relaxation of the refund period. 

On March 22, around 72 trains passed through Vijayawada station. On Monday, three trains passed through Vijayawada; two of these passed through Vijayawada station and the other passed Rayanapadu station. In most of these services, passengers faced a shortage of food and water. “The LTT train started from Vizag on Saturday and it does not have a pantry car. Many of us were hoping for at least a cup of tea but eventually had to travel on an empty stomach, before the train was stopped at Thane instead of LTT,” a passenger rued. 

Railway officials admitted that many passengers had to face inconveniences but stated that measures were in place to keep essentials running. 

“All catering units have been completely shut since yesterday. Platform vending in South Central Railway (SCR) zone was carried out with bare minimum staff at important stations. IRCTC food plazas and other restaurant services were shut, but take away counters were available for passengers,” a railway spokesperson told TOI. 

For the passengers who got off at Vijayawada, commuting home was a struggle as not only was there a lack of public transportation, the autorickshaws at the station saw the opportunity to fleece customers and demanded high rates.
