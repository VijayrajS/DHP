2020-05-13
Nagpur: The CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-Neeri) organized a live broadcast of the National Technology Day lecture on Monday. Prof Manish Kumar, department of Earth sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar was the guest speaker and Prof Ashok Pandey, scientist, CSIR-Indian Institute for Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR), Lucknow was the special guest on the occasion. CSIR-Neeri director Rakesh Kumar and chief scientist and head, climate change and skilling division, JS Pandey, also joined the event online.


Speaking on ‘Propensity of SARS-CoV2 migration to aquatic environment and wastewater based surveillance’, speaker Kumar said that it is not possible to test all 1.3 billion people of India for Covid-19. Therefore, scientists are taking a cue from the country’s surveillance programme for polio and turning to sewage to get a clearer snapshot of how many people are infected with the coronavirus. Pandey endorsed the wastewater based surveillance approach to combat Covid-19 and said that this method can be useful looking at the current testing limitations.

In his welcome address, director Kumar informed that CSIR is working on five verticals to fight against the pandemic namely surveillance, rapid and cheap diagnosis, development of new therapies (including repurposing of drugs and new drugs), hospital assistive devices and supply chain and logistics. Among these verticals, CSIR-Neeri is participating in the three verticals, he added.
