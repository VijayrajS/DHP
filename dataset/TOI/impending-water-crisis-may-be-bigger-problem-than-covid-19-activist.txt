Impending water crisis may be bigger problem than Covid-19: Hyderabad activist
2020-04-09
HYDERABAD: City-based green activist Kalpana Ramesh has said more people may face dire consequences because of scarcity of water than Covid-19, if we are not careful. Calling for water conservation now, she says the state is staring at an impending crisis. 

The activist, who has shared short videos on social media on how to conserve water even during a lockdown, said, “At a time when hygiene is top priority, how do we expect our daily wage immigrant workers to keep clean without access to clean water? With temperatures set to soar, we will face a water shortage soon.” 

Speaking about the mindless waste of water, even in washing one’s hands, Ramesh said, “One needs to wash one’s hands if we go out or come in contact with someone who is showing symptoms. Washing one’s hands repeatedly for no reason, is not necessary.” 

In her video, the activist, who received praise from the Prime Minister for her water conservation campaign, said, “Bathroom cleaning still takes less than five litres of water, and it takes less than 50 litres to clean the whole house.” 

Speaking to TOI, Kalpana highlighted other measures that one could follow. “Keeping the shower pressure low, using half flushes, using a bucket for bathing rather than the shower and steam mops are simple steps that can be taken while at home.” 

Stating that resources were directly proportionate to one’s health, she said it was necessary to take up rooftop water conservation (rainwater harvesting) so as to prevent urban flooding. “If people plan rainwater harvesting now, we can prevent a shortfall in the coming months. Preventing urban flooding also ensures the reduction in pathogens across the city,” she added.
