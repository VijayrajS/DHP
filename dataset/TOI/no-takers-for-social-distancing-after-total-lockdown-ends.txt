No takers for social distancing in Salem after total lockdown ends
2020-04-30
SALEM: Residents of Salem, which saw an extended 4-day total lockdown that ended on Wednesday, threw caution to the winds and congregated in large numbers across shops and markets to stock essentials. The rush at shops and markets was so heavy that several health officials sounded alarm on the real threat due to non-compliance of social distancing norms.


On an average, at least 100 people could be seen standing at grocery shops, vegetable markets and meat stalls before 6 am. “We could not buy anything as all shops were shut since Saturday morning... so we have come out to stock on essentials,” said B Usharani, a resident of Ammapet. The district administration had imposed the total lockdown since Saturday in corporation areas.

A huge posse of people could be seen at all temporary vegetable markets functioning at the Old Bus Stand, New Bus Stand, Hasthampatty, Suramangalam and Ammapet. 

Police commissioner T Senthil Kumar said criminal cases had been registered against around 100 people for not maintaining social distancing norms on Wednesday. He advised people not to venture out in groups as the chances of contracting Covid-19 are still high. tnn
