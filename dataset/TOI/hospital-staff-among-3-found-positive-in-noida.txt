NOIDA: A hospital worker was among three people who tested positive in Noida on Tuesday, taking the Covid-19 count to 362 in the district. While 244 patients have recovered, active cases remain at 113.


Among those who were found to have Covid-19 was a 20-year-old man who worked as a support staffer at GIMS and was already in quarantine. Another patient was a 39-year-old woman from Salarpur and the third, a 38-year-old man from Gijhore.

The Noida administration on Tuesday also made its fourth isolation centre operational — a 100-bed facility at Kailash Hospital took in two patients. “We had acquired Kailash Hospital’s isolation facility about a month back when some medical workers were found positive. We are now focusing on rigorous contact tracing and containment drives at highly infected clusters,” said Narendra Bhooshan, nodal officer in charge of handling Covid-19 response.

Noida now has isolation wards with 500 beds in total, of which 113 are occupied. Health camps were organised in 13 places across Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola and JJ Colony, which have accounted for a majority of recent cases. Health officials screened 662 patients, of whom 12 were referred to the district hospital as they had fever. Meanwhile, nine patients were discharged on Tuesday.
