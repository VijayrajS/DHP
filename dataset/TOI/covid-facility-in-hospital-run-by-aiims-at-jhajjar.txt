Covid-19 facility in hospital run by AIIMS at Jhajjar
2020-03-23
NEW DELHI: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Haryana’s Jhajjar, which is run by AIIMS, will work as a Covid-19-specific hospital for the NCR.


NCI, with around 800 beds, started both out-patient and in-patient services for cancer patients recently. However, in view of the Covid-19 crisis, the government has decided to use it specifically to manage patients who are moderately or severely ill, the Union health ministry announced on Sunday.

All states have been asked to identify hospitals that can be turned into Covid-19-specific health facilities, said joint secretary Lav Aggarwal. “We have also asked the states to ramp up infrastructure needs such as ventilators. The central government has placed orders for 1,200 ventilators too,” he added.

As per the plan, prepared by AIIMS in consultation with the ministry, the institute will triage Covid-19 cases requiring acute management at its 20-bedded isolation facility in the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, following which they will be transferred to NCI.

“We plan to create 125 beds in NCI. Of this, 25 will be ICU beds and the rest will have advanced facilities for monitoring and acute management. Depending on the patient rush, the numbers can be expanded,” said an AIIMS official.

At present, most Covid-19 suspect and positive cases are being kept at Safdarjung, RML, Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals among others. Though the isolation facilities have been created in separate blocks, other patients and staff are still scared, said doctors at these hospitals.

“At Lok Nayak Hospital, triaging is being done on the ground floor and then symptomatic ones are being shifted to the sixth floor of the emergency block. For X-Ray or CT scans, the suspects will have to be taken from the sixth floor across the OPD and pharmacy areas. All regular patients also use these areas. This strategy needs to be reviewed,” a senior doctor explained.
