Samajwadi Party questions government’s claims on coronavirus among migrants
2020-05-27
LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday questioned the logic behind government’s claims that most of the migrants returning from Maharashtra and Delhi have coronavirus infection.

“At least 25 lakh migrants have returned to UP, how come only a few thousands have tested positive,” Akhilesh asked.

Speaking at a webinar on Monday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said 25 lakh migrant workers returned from other states, adding that 75% from Mumbai and 50% from Delhi had coronavirus infection. 

The CM also said 25-30% migrants from other states were infected with the disease.

Akhilesh said, “According to the unique political arithmetic of the chief minister, 75% of migrants from Mumbai (Maharashtra), 50% from Delhi and 25% of remaining migrants are infected with coronavirus. Then how come despite the return of 25 lakh migrants, only a few thousand people have tested positive in UP so far?”

Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary of the Sanajwadi Party said, “On the basis of CM’s statement, the state presently has around 10 lakh coronavirus-infected people, including migrants.”

“Actually, it is not his fault. He has read out what his bureaucrats gave to him. He didn’t even realise what his statement will translate into numbers,” Chaudhary said.

The SP chief demanded help to farmers who are sowing kharif crop.
