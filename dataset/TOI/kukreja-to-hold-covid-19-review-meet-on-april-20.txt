2020-04-19
Nagpur: Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s health committee chairman Virendra Kukreja has called a meeting on April 20 to assess Covid-19 situation in the city. Apart from eight other members of the panel, Kukreja has also invited mayor Sandip Joshi, deputy mayor Manisha Kothe, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, and additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi.

The meeting will be held at Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial standing committee hall at NMC’s Civil Lines headquarters from 2pm. As the meeting hall is not very big, it will be a Herculean task to maintain social distancing among corporators and senior NMC officials.

The meet will discuss review NMC’s preparedness to fight Covid-19, spraying of disinfectants across the city, positive and suspected patients of coronavirus, cleaning of city, big and small nullahs etc. It will also discuss outsiders quarantined at various institutions.

Sources said that the corporators from across the city expressed anguish over civic administration’s move to ignore them while carrying out disinfecting drives in their respective prabhags.

The health department will also submit a proposal of giving approval to the minutes of last meeting held on January 31 this year.
