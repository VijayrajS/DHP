BAREILLY: Three members of a family, including two sisters and their aunt, tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Moradabad on Tuesday, taking the district tally to 92, while one positive case was reported from neighbouring Sambhal, taking the district tally to 16.

The 45-year-old woman is a sister-in-law of the doctor who succumbed to the deadly virus in Moradabad, while the two sisters, aged 23 and 12, are his nieces. 

Notably, six people have been discharged, while four patients succumbed to the disease in Moradabad district, so far. 

Moradabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr MC Garg said that on Tuesday, five people, including three Tablighi Jamaatis and two residents of neighbouring Amroha district, were discharged from different quarantine centres.

District magistrate RK Singh said private medical practitioners associated with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) too joined the fight against Covid-19 and strengthen the telemedicine facility started by the district administration to provide relief to the people suffering from various diseases as they were unable to visit doctors in the lockdown.

The district administration has also issued a list of nine IMA doctors with their contact numbers for a free consultation over the phone. Notably, the telemedicine service was launched by government doctors on Monday.

On the other hand, a 27-year-old woman, who along with her husband arrived in Sambhal from Ghaziabad recently, tested positive. 

Sambhal CMO Dr Anita Singh said the family was quarantined and their samples were sent for the test. The reports confirmed only the woman to be positive for Covid-19, said the CMO, adding that her husband is a vegetable seller.
