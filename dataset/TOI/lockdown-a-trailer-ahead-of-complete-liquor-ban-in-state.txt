2020-05-03
VIJAYAWADA: Excise officials have seized 2,153 litres of liquor and 1,506 litres of beer since March 22, the day bars and alcohol shops were closed in the state, ahead of the lockdown.


While on the one hand instances of liquor shops being looted have increased, in some cases in connivance with excise officials who have been eventually caught and suspended, on the other hand there has been a spike in arrack brewing. 

 

Excise officials have destroyed 11.64 lakh litres of fermented jaggery wash in last 40 days apart from destroying 47,152 litres of illegally distilled liquor. The numbers have increased two folds when compared to previous month and the corresponding month of the previous year. Even the price of arrack has increased given the demand. 

Although crippled with staff crunch, as more than 700 personnel from excise enforcement wing have been deployed for Covid-19 containment duties, the officials have managed to book double the number of cases in the lockdown period. The enforcement director Vinit Brijlal said enforcement staff have shown exemplary efforts in curbing arrack menace.

Brijlal further said the enforcement work during the lockdown has been like a pilot project for them before implementing complete liquor ban in the days to come. He said they have got an idea about the challenges that they are going to face in the future and it is a learning experience for them to devise strategies to implement complete liquor ban in phased manner.
