Mumbai: Business travel is likely to resume to pre-Covid levels within 6 months post-lockdown, according to a survey carried out by a hospitality firm, which said it had based its findings on responses from over 500 participants that included companies from IT, pharmaceuticals and FMCG sectors. 

“Eighty per cent respondents expect business travel to resume to pre-Covid levels in their organization within 6 months post-lockdown,” said the survey. But a total of 58% of corporates expect reduction of 15% or more in travel budget, it said, adding that 19% expect a reduction of less than 15%, while 24% corporates expect travel budgets to remain same post the lockdown is lifted. “While one-third of respondents said they would not move employees to lower-tier hotels to save expenses, the others said they are expected to make this transition to reduce their travel budgets,” the survey added. 

The Indian hotel market is more than $10 billion in size. The pandemic is expected to leave corporate businesses with less money to spend on travel, lodging and 
entertainment. “Nearly half of the respondents in this survey had a strength of more than 500 permanent employees. More than 10% of employees travel more than once a month at 45% surveyed organisations,” said the survey carried out by FabHotels. “Not surprisingly, hygiene and sanitization at the hotels is going to become extremely critical in the decision-making process of corporates. About 93% of respondents said they are likely to switch from unbranded to branded hotels post-lockdown for better hygiene and sanitization requirements for their employees. About 88.4% respondents said they are likely to revaluate their budget hotel partnerships post-lockdown,” it added.
