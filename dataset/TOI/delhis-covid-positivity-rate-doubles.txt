‘Delhi’s Covid positivity rate doubles’
2020-06-04
NEW DELHI : The positivity rate for Covid-19 has doubled in Delhi, remains worryingly high in Maharashtra and is nudging downward in Gujarat, an analysis of two 15-day intervals from May 7 to June 1 for the three states that have recorded a high number of coronavirus cases shows.


The positivity rate -- confirmed Covid-19 cases per 100 tests – for the country as a whole has increased from 5% to 6.41% and the Covid graph for confirmed cases continues to rise though at an even pace.

In Delhi, the positivity rate has doubled from 7% in the May 7-21 fortnight to 14% during May19-June 1. Maharashtra continues to have the highest positivity rate though the rise over the two periods has been modest, from 18% to 18.46% meaning almost one in every five tests is returning a positive result. A large chunk of Maharashtra cases are from Mumbai. Gujarat has seen a marginal decline in the positivity rate from 9% to 8%, pointing to modest success in keeping the disease in check.

Among other states, the situation in Bihar is worrisome, with the positivity rate rising from 5% to 9% during this period. Delhi and Bihar now have the fastest growth in confirmed cases after Maharashtra, though the capital has recorded many more cases. 

The positivity rate over a two-week period is a parameter utilised by governments to assess whether lockdown rules can be eased. High positivity and fatality rates can be indicative that a state may be testing the sickest and not screening enough sections of the population. While contact tracing and testing are key to containment of the pandemic, most states, and India as a whole, have recorded low fatality rates.
