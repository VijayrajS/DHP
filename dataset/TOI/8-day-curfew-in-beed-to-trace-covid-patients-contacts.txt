Eight-day curfew in Maharashtra's Beed to trace Covid-19 patient’s contacts
2020-05-29
AURANGABAD: The Beed district administration has imposed a curfew in Beed city and 12 other villages for eight days starting on Thursday. The decision was made after the throat swab sample of a man, who returned to his village in Karegaon, of Patoda taluka, from Mumbai, tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday evening. 


Soon after the man came in Mumbai, he was shifted to a hospital in Beed, where his throat swab samples were collected. “In the hospital, the man may have come in contact with at least 300 people from different localities or villages around the city. The curfew has been effected for eight days as we want to trace all his contacts,” Beed superintendent of police Harrsh Poddar said.

A few days ago, Beed collector Rahul Rekhawar had allowed many establishments, including liquor shops and barber shops, to operate for eight hours. Following this new development, Rekhawar issued a fresh order late on Wednesday, imposing a complete curfew from the early hours of Thursday till June 4. He exempted health services, newspapers and media services for 24 hours. 

It has been found that the patient came in contact with people from Beed city and at least 12 villages including Khandala, Charhata, Palwan and Itt (Beed taluka), Vaijala, Dongarkini (Patoda), Devandi (Wadwani), Khandvi, Madalmohi, Dharvanta (Georai taluka), Kharmata (Keij) and Pargaon (Dharur). 

For medical emergencies, residents can make online applications on www.covid19.mhpolice.in to get a pass. The district collector has also made it compulsory for the residents under curfew to download the Setu App.
