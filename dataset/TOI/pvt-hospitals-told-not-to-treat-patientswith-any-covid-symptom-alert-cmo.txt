LUCKNOW: District administration on Sunday directed all private hospitals in the city not to treat any patient with Covid-19 symptoms like cough, fever or breathing trouble but alert the chief medical officer and refer them to government hospitals immediately.

 The administration also asked the CMO to conduct rapid antibody test of entire staff posted to supervise quarantine facility in Bakshi-Ka-Talab. All government employees in essential services, including police, LMC staff and doctors, having flu-like symptoms will also be tested as they are exposed to risk of catching infection.

Police and LMC have been asked to slap fine of Rs 5,000 on those found spitting in public place, lodge FIR against those found moving around unnecessarily and fine people without mask. 

All passes issued to people in hotspot areas have been cancelled and CCTVs have been installed for 24X7 monitoring through Smart City Command Centre. LMC has been directed to sanitise area falling in the radius of 5 km around hotspots. All offices that are open have been told to remove door mats as its sanitisation is difficult.
