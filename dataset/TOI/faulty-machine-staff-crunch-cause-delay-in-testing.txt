Kerala: Faulty machine, staff crunch cause delay in testing
2020-04-30
KOTTAYAM: The two Covid-19 testing centres in the district are yet to begin full-fledged operations causing a delay in the rollout of results of samples lined up following a recent spike in cases in Kottayam and Idukki.


The two testing centres in the district are at the Inter University Centre for Bio Medical Research and Super Speciality Hospital in Thalappady and at the Government Medical College Hospital. 

The lab in Thalappady has two machines for testing, but the bigger one has not been functioning for over 10 days now. Though one of its parts was replaced, it conked out again. 

At present, the lab is totally depending on the other machine which can test a maximum of 96 samples daily. Officials said shortage of staff in the lab is also a problem. “There are around 10 employees in the lab. If we get more staff, we can work in three shifts,” said an official.

He added that a major part of the testing process is done manually and one has to be extremely careful while dealing with the samples. K P Mohanakumar, director of the centre, said that the government has assured him that it will provide a new machine on Thursday. “Once we get it, around 200 samples could be tested daily. We may need some time to train the staff,” he said. The samples which are tested positive here are sent to the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha for reconfirmation.

The second testing centre in the district was opened at the MCH only a few days ago. Though there are three new machines here that have a capacity to test over 200 samples a day, only 70-80 samples are being tested currently. “This is mainly because the staff will have to get accustomed to the new machines. We are hoping to increase the number of tests by next week,” said Dr Renjin, RMO, MCH.
