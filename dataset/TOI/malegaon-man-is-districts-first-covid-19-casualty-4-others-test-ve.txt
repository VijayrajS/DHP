NASHIK: The district recorded its first coronavirus-related death after a 51-year-old man succumbed to the infection at the Malegaon government hospital on Wednesday afternoon.


The man and five others showing Covid-19-like symptoms were admitted to the Malegaon sub-civil hospital on Tuesday. They are all residents of Malegaon.

The throat swab reports arrived on Wednesday night and five of them, including the man who succumbed, were found to be Covid-19 positive. The samples were tested at the lab in the Dhule-based government medical college and hospital.

“Five suspects had tested positive, including the man who died. A woman and three other men who tested positive have been kept in the isolation ward of the sub-civil hospital and are being treated,” district collector Suraj Mandhare. He added that the other confirmed patients are stable.

All the individuals were admitted to the sub-civil hospital with complaints of respiratory illness. “One of them had received some treatment before being admitted here,” the collector said.

As of now, the administration is tracing contacts of the patients who come from the different parts of the textile town. The deceased had been to Umrah and returned more than a month ago.

“None of the five positive patients had a history of travel in the past fortnight. We are still trying to figure out if there are more patients in and around their houses and the ones they came in contact with. There could be a clue as to how the infection reached them,” Mandhare said.

Mandhare rushed to Malegaon in the morning to conduct a meeting of the municipal corporation officials, health officials, the police department and others. He directed all of them to take stringent measures but remain sensitive to people’s needs.

He stressed on stopping people’s movement in the town to cut down the possibility of coronavirus spread. He requested people to stay indoors.

“Lock yourself in the house. All the essential goods including food, milk and vegetables will be provided by the services hired for the people. They need not get out of the house for the next 14 days. This is the best way to treat the infection,” the officer said warning that people who do not follow the orders will face strict action.
