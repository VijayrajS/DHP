2020-03-24
AHMEDABAD: On Monday, Gujarat recorded the highest cases so far in a day with 12 positive cases. However, for the first time, the number of local transmitted infection cases were the same as the ones with travel history.


According to health department officials, out of 30 positive cases recorded in the state, 22 are having travel history whereas the eight remaining cases had not gone out of India in the recent past. The only confirmed death due to Covid-19 infection from Surat of a 67-year-old man had also travelled to Jaipur and Delhi.

 
 

“At present the state has entered the second phase of the infection spread where clusters – persons who are in close contact with possible carriers – get infected. The third stage is identified when it expands to larger community where no such contact is required and in the fourth, it takes shape of an epidemic. Different parts of the world are in different stages of this cycle,” said a senior state health department official.

Social distancing has been found to be the only remedy which could put brake on the spread, said infectious disease experts. “The cases in Gujarat have started clustering in some parts – that also from specific countries. We are yet to see how the viral spread behaves. But still we can manage it with proper precautions, identification of all those with history of travel abroad and those who have come in contact with these persons,” said an epidemiologist.

The break-up of the travel history of the persons infected include five from Saudi Arabia, four from UAE (Dubai), four from the UK, three from the US, three from Sri Lanka, one each from Finland, France and Spain.
