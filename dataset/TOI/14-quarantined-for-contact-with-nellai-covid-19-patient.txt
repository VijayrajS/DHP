MADURAI: Fourteen people who had come in contact with the 43-year-old male Covid-19 positive patient undergoing treatment at the isolation ward in Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), have been quarantined, district officials said on Tuesday. “We identified 14 persons, including staff and those at the hotel where the patient had been staying. They have been quarantined. We are doing our best to not miss out on anyone who may have been in contact,” said a health official.


The official added that the patient was stable and responding well to treatment. On Monday, it came to light that the patient had not given accurate information to health officials about his location prompting district officials to probe his whereabouts and movement before admission to the hospital.

Meanwhile, a two-year-old girl with travel history to Kerala was admitted to the isolation ward at Kanyakumari Medical College Hospital on suspicion of having Covid-19 symptoms on Tuesday. Her samples have been sent to the Tirunelveli MCH for testing. 

Two other suspected Covid-19 cases - a 60-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man - are in the hospital. On Tuesday, the samples of the 60-year-old woman sent for testing returned negative, while the test result for the 26-year-old man is expected on Wednesday.
