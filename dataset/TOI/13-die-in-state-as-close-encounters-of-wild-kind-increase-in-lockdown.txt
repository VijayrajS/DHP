13 die in Madhya Pradesh as close encounters of wild kind increase in lockdown
2020-04-18
BHOPAL: In lockdown, the wild seems to be reclaiming its turf, at the cost of human lives. Never before have wild animals killed as many humans in Madhya Pradesh as in the last three weeks. The toll reached 13 on Thursday when a leopard killed a nine-year-old girl near Satpura Tiger Reserve (STR).


Like three others killed by tigers in the past 10 days, she too was stooping to gather mahua flowers when she was attacked.

If birds and deer and even foxes are being seen on deserted roads in urban areas in the silence of the lockdown, in villages close to forests, there are close encounters with claws and fangs. 

Sighting of tigers on roads has increased manifold. Some health department officials had the mesmerising sight of four tigers on a road passing through Satpura forests in Balaghat district. A video of big cats napping on the road, unbothered by the vehicle has gone viral. Not only tigers, even wild elephants, sloth bears and wild boars are being increasingly sighted close to human habitations, say officials. Sometimes, the encounters get deadly. Four people were trampled by elephants in Annuppur and Seoni districts, followed by three deaths in tiger attack near Pench and Badhavgarh reserves in Seoni and Katni districts respectively and the remaining ones by sloth bears, leopards and wild boars in different regions of the state. Compensating aggrieved families has turned out into a major problem with treasury holding funds, said insiders. 

It was on April 2 three people including two women were trampled by a herd of 12 elephants in Rajendragram of Annupur district.
