AHMEDABAD: Around 20,000 Covid -19 advance related claims amounting to Rs 45 crore have been settled by the Employeeâ€™s Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) regional office in Gujarat zone. 


Another 25,000 claims and other claims amounting to Rs 50 crore were also cleared recently, the EPFO said in an official communique. 

In this time of lockdown, when people are finding it difficult to satisfy their basic necessities, the proactive approach by the EPFO, not just in the offices but also on the socials media, has brought much-needed relief to various stakeholders like PF subscribers and employers, according to Manoranjan Kumar, regional commissioner of Ahmedabad PF office. 

To fight the coronavirus pandemic, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) has made a provision for payment of 24% of an employees monthly wages in their provident fund accounts for next three months i.e. April, 2020, May, 2020 and June, 2020. This will cover the employees and employers share of PF contribution, giving a big financial support to the workers and the companies. This move is also expected to prevent disruption in their employment as well as keep them away from risk of losing their employment. 

The PMGKY also makes provision for allowing non-refundable advance of 75% of the amount or three months of the wages, whichever is lower, from their provident fund accounts. Families of four crore workers registered under EPF can take benefit of this window. 

The officials coming to office are taking all possible precautions and following norms of social distancing and personal hygiene. The authorities are taking special efforts to sanitize the workplace and officials coming to office are thermally screened at the entrance, according to the press release.
