And while the crew and cast is taking all precautions, there are rumours that the film shooting may be postponed till further notice. 
The cast, which includes actors Tabu, Kartik Aaryan, Kiara Advani, Rajpal Yadav and Rajesh Sharma took a day off from shoot on Friday after shooting throughout the night on Thursday at Mahmoodabad Palace in Sitapur district. Director Anees Bazmee, when asked if indeed the shooting will be cancelled, told us that the team was to discuss the matter on Friday evening. “We will all sit and have a meeting on what to do because we have a big unit and the schedule is also long. There are a lot of things involved, so we are yet to decide, which we will by today evening,” he said.
