2020-06-03
Kolkata: Hyundai Motors India Ltd has achieved a morale-boosting milestone of exporting 5,000 cars since its resumed operations post lockdown on May 8, 2020. Its rival Maruti Suzuki exported 4,651 cars since beginning production on May 12.

The Indian subsidiary of the South Korean auto giant Hyundai Motor Co was the leading passenger car exporter in 2019-2020 when it shipped 1.8 lakh cars to 88 countries across four continents. Though the exports clocked this year is nearly a third of what it achieved in the corresponding month last year, that it has managed to ship more than 5,000 cars to markets abroad despite the Covid situation worldwide is what makes the achievement more creditable that last year.

"The ability to revive exports and achieve these numbers is testimony to the strength of the Hyundai brand worldwide. Some of the orders were pending when India went into lockdown," said HMIL assistant vice-president (exports and operations planning) Pankaj Tiwari.

Earlier this year, the company achieved the milestone of exporting 30 lakh cars since it began operations in 1999. While it had started with exports of the Santro, the only product it made back then, the new generation Santro, it now exports all the other models it manufacures here including the Verna.Currently, Hyundai India exports 10 models: Atos (Santro), Grand i10, Xcent, Grand i10 (Nios) and Grand i10 (Aura), Elite i20, i20 Active, Accent (Verna), Venue and new Creta.

The 10 lakh milestone was achieved in FebruAry 2010. The 20 lakh came four years later in March, 2014. Earlier this January, the company clocked 30 lakh exports. "We are exporting to four continents. Some of the bigger markets are Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Colombia, Bahamas and Ecuador," said Tiwari.

Maruti Suzuki, meanwhile, posted sales of 18,539 cars in May 2020. Of these, 13,865 cars were sold in the domestic market. It also sold 23 units of Baleno to Toyota that sells it under the Glanza badge.
