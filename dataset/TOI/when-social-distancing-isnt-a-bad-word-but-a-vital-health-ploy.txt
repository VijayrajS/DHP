Covid-19 scare: When social distancing isn’t a bad word, but a vital health ploy
2020-03-14
NEW DELHI: Schools, colleges and cinema halls have been shut in Delhi to slow the spread of the dreaded Covid-19. People have started avoiding crowds, cancelling non-essential events, minimising travel, working from home where possible. Social contact is being reduced, as people avoid handshakes and hugs and greet each other from a wary distance. On public transport or in a restaurant, a sneeze can draw alarmed attention. Religious gatherings and pilgrimages have been cancelled. It is time to consciously go into screensaver mode, if not a full shutdown. 


Coronavirus outbreak live updates

This is not paranoia — because apart from protecting oneself from infection, this ‘social distancing’ is critical to slow the rate at which other people are infected. Even if you are young and healthy, you live in an inter-connected world and your actions right now can determine whether the novel coronavirus explodes or not. 

During the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, the US cities that closed schools and discouraged gatherings, and did it early, like St Louis, contained the disease. Thousands died in the towns that didn’t, like Philadelphia. While that epidemic had a mortality rate of 2.5%, WHO estimates a 3.4% rate for the novel coronavirus. 

While the virus has already touched Indians, social distancing is now necessary to “flatten the curve”, say public health experts — to avert a crisis, and to buy time. “Right now the government’s focus is on quarantining those who have brought the virus into India and tracing their contacts to prevent community spread,” said public health expert Srinath Reddy. So far, 52 public hospitals are identified as testing centres. Places with organised primary health centres like Kerala and Tamil Nadu are better prepared to deal in a situation of community spread, Reddy said. Testing, counselling or triage or home surveillance need a primary health force that isn’t available in many parts of India, he added.

“Everyone in the world is meeting this virus for the first time, and it has spread at a pace that nobody was prepared for,” said Reddy. Over time, he noted, we will be able to gauge if there has been community spillage, one can develop diagnostic tests, use artificial intelligence to detect patterns, and see if weather has an impact on the virus.

In India too, containing coronavirus is a challenge. Neighbourhoods here are dense, families are tightly networked. “The correlation between epidemic diffusion and population density is not direct,” pointed out Olivier Telle, a researcher at the Centre de Sciences Humanities, who has studied disease diffusion in Delhi. But given urban India’s commuting patterns, diseases like the flu and coronavirus can spread easily, especially in places where there is no health infrastructure to break the spread, he said. 

Many citizens don’t have ready access to soap and water and they also need to earn a daily livelihood. The hardest hit of the population will also be the most vulnerable. The Kerala scheme of reaching mid-day meals to schoolchildren at home is a sensible and sensitive intervention in this context. Indian manufacturing units are largely informal where people work cheek-by-jowl and it won’t be easy to enforce separation. “The poor and the indigent will be particularly affected,” felt Deepak Mehta, sociologist at Ashoka University

There will be other effects in India — citizen protests or demonstrations can now be seen as a public health problem, for instance, as can mass security deployments. During a public health emergency, it makes sense to pull together rather than sharpen divides between groups. 

“A pandemic in our networked age is entirely different from previous contagions,” explained Mehta. “When it ‘viralises’ as news, it can create great panic. When public spaces empty out, when you are confined or incarcerated at home, there are consequences in terms of social relatedness and economic activity. Teaching and learning, for instance, are complicated without face-to-face encounters,” he said.

What are the emotional consequences to people shuttering themselves in? It can hurt those who already lead isolated lives, especially the old and lonely, those with mental or other disabilities. “On the other hand, the fact that people are confined at home and have to cut down on meetings might even make them focus on their family and friends. Maybe that is good from a mental health perspective as long as there is no alarm and panic,” Reddy suggested.

Self isolation is not easy for a social species. Many of us are bunkering in, to find that staying home is no fun when it is imposed on us. Yet, social media and entertainment can help us endure the lockdown better. People have to make a conscious effort to maintain routines, get regular exercise — some are tuning into a scheduled yoga class through video-calls, for instance. Children, especially, get cabin-fever when stuck indoors.

Actual quarantine, of course, can have greater psychological costs. The separation from loved ones, the confinement and uncertainty, and change in habits can have lasting effects, says a team from Kings College, London, which studied previous experiences with H1N1 flu, SARS, MERS and so on. Their study, published in Lancet, found that post-traumatic stress and depression can continue for up to three years after the episode. Sadness, anger and irritability run high. Economic loss and social stigma also worsen the situation. 

Fear and anxiety can make people turn on specific populations — there have already been attacks in India on those who ‘look Chinese’. “Outsiders are seen as the ones bringing in the disease,” said Telle. “But to tackle epidemics, the mindset needs to be one of collective solidarity — that it is not just your health, but your neighbour’s that needs to be protected.”

We live in an integrated world, and it won’t be easy to reverse the economic and social flows. This situation can also prompt feelings of care and solidarity, and a realisation that harm to one is harm to all.
