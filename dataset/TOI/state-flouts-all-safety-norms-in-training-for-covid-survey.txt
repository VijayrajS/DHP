Goa flouts all safety norms in training for Covid survey
2020-04-10
PANAJI: It was more of social mingling on Thursday at the training sessions by the state government for its staff and teachers for the three-day door-to-door health survey from April 13, as people were herded into crowded rooms putting hundreds of lives at risk.

From teachers being called in from maternity leave to random allotment of work, they questioned the entire purpose of the Covid-19 survey and the training for it—which was to teach them to operate an app. 

“There was no social distancing maintained. We did not know the travel history of the person next to us,” president of the All Goa Secondary School Teachers’ Association Dattatraya Naik said.

Most of them who attended the training were neither given masks nor hand sanitisers for conducting the survey.

They even feared that in the absence of proper protocols being followed, they may end up contracting the virus and spreading it by going door to door.
