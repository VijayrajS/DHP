AHMEDABAD: A resident of Bavla approached the local mamlatdar over four Chinese nationals living in a housing society after scare of coronavirus. The local administration carried out a test right at their residences, declaring them ‘normal’ but still the locals are apprehensive about the viral spread.


Atul Thakor, associated with a socio-political organization, had written a letter to the mamlatdar on February 5. ‘In Alok City of Bavla, a family of four to five persons has arrived recently from China. The country is affected by coronavirus and the virus is spreading fast. There is no treatment available except awareness,’ mentioned the letter. 

‘Thus, I request you to immediately test these families as the housing scheme has 250-odd families and they are feeling unsafe. The Chinese should be declared safe after due medical procedure or they should be relocated.’ mentioned Thakor’s letter.

When approached, Thakor told TOI on Sunday that a medical team did test the four Chinese nationals. “The primary test has showed no signs of coronavirus. But we need more assurance,” he said. “I have also written to the health secretary about the same issue.”

Bavla administration said that the Chinese nationals, who came to India on February 2, were duly tested at the airport and had showed no signs of viral infection. They however pointed at the heightened awareness about coronavirus that led to apprehension among locals. Authorities said that if needed, the Chinese nationals will be screened again.
