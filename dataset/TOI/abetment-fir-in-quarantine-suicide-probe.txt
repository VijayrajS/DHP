Greater Noida: Abetment FIR in quarantine suicide probe
2020-04-15
GREATER NOIDA: Authorities at the quarantine centre, where a 32-year-old man allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the 7th-floor terrace, have lodged a police complaint for abetment to suicide.

Police said officials at the isolation centre — set up on the campus of Galgotias University — had mentioned in the complaint that despite efforts to pacify Mohammed Gulzar, unknown persons had provoked him on Sunday evening, hours before he committed suicide. Gulzar, who had a history of mental health problems, had been beaten up on April 10 by a group of villagers who suspected him of attending the Jamaat congregation. 

Rajesh Kumar Singh, DCP (zone 3), said an FIR under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC was registered against unknown persons. “Prima facie, there is hardly any evidence of someone provoking him. We are investigation the case from all possible angles,” he added. 

Diwakar Singh, the additional district magistrate who is also conducting a detailed inquiry into the alleged suicide, said he had not been informed about any FIR. 

“I have no information about this FIR. I have sent an interim report to the administration, mentioning the sequence of events that led to the suicide. Further action will be taken after the statements are collected from doctors at the quarantine centre and the man’s family members,” he said.
