2020-03-23
AHMEDABAD: Following the announcement of lockdown in four major cities of Gujarat – Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot – by the government of Gujarat, a number of industrial estates have announced shutting of their industrial units for at least three days. These include manufacturing units in Naroda GIDC, textile process houses in Narol, garment manufacturers and dyestuff manufacturers across the state.

"Some 1,300 units in Naroda GIDC will remain closed till March 25 and we have informed the staffers that this may be extended. These include units manufacturing dyes, chemicals, intermediates and other products. We have also assured all the workers that their salary will not be deducted," said Shailesh Patwari, past president, Naroda Industries Association.

A similar decision was taken by Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA) which announced on Saturday itself that the units will be shut for three days. "Some 1,000 dyestuff manufacturing units across the state will remain closed till March 25. The decision has been taken in the interest of public health and safety," said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA. Industry estimates suggest that the shutdown will amount to losses worth Rs 25,000 crore per day for the dyestuff manufacturers.

Gujarat Garment Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA) too announced a shutdown of their units. "We had already announced three days of shutdown for all garment manufacturing units from Saturday to Monday. Now that the government has announced a shutdown till March 25, we will obviously comply and have informed our workers accordingly," said Arpan Shah, honorary treasurer, GGMA. 

Ahmedabad Textile Processors’ Association (ATPA) members too said they will shut manufacturing units till March 25 and take a call on whether to continue with shutdown, based on the situation.
