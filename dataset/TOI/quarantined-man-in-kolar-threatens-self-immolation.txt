KOLAR: A 38-year-old man in quarantine in Nidaghatta, Malur taluk, Kolar district threatened to commit suicide by immolating himself in a gram panchayat office on Wednesday.


Manjunath and his family were put in home quarantine after a veterinary surgeon from Bengaluru visited them on Sunday. Across Kolar district, anyone receiving guests from other districts are put in quarantine. The district is Covid-free and officials are working to keep it that way.

A task force in Nidaghatta put Manjunath and his family in home quarantine. However, Manjunath and his family left their house and went straight to the gram panchayat office in neighbouring Santhehalli.

Manjunath alleged some members of the task force had taken their pictures in quarantine and are circulating it on social media to defame him and his family. Carrying a bottle of petrol, Manjunath entered the panchayat office along with his family and locked himself up, threatening to commit suicide.

Later, Malur legislator KY Nanje Gowda arrived at the spot and assured Manjunath that action would be taken against those responsible for circulating his pictures. On those assurances, Manjunath and his family later returned home.
