‘Muslim Covid-19 victims martyrs’
2020-04-03
AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said Muslims who died due to Covid-19 as “shaheed” (martyrs). Several persons from the community, including nine from Telangana, who had attended a religious event at Nizamuddin in Delhi in March, had become victims of the virus. 

“Those who die as a result of Covid-19 are martyrs. Burial of martyrs does not require kafan (shroud) or ghusl (cleansing). One must immediately offer janazah and carry out the burial with a few people,” he said speaking to a news channel. He said that a religious event was being exploited to blame the Muslim community for the recent spike in Covid-19 cases across the country. “After a BJP government was formed in MP, thousands gathered to celebrate the victory, but neither objections were raised nor social distancing was remembered,” Asad said.
