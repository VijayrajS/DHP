2020-04-29
Amravati: With the results of experimental throat swab tests conducted at the Covid lab on Amravati University campus matching with that of samples tested at AIIMS Nagpur, the city has inched a step closer to getting Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approval for the testing facility.

“The result of the tests done at AU lab was required to match with that of AIIMS results to get the approval and the hard work by lab’s nodal officer Dr Prashant Thakare and his team has yielded result,” said a jubilant vice-chancellor Dr Murludhar Chandekar late on Tuesday.

“The AIIMS authorities have forwarded our case to ICMR for its approval, which is expected soon,” he said.

Guardian minister Yashomati Thakur, prime mover of the lab’s case, expressed happiness over the development and said it will greatly help control Covid pandemic in the district.

Earlier in the day, divisional commissioner Piyush Singh had told TOI that staff of Amravati University lab was undergoing training at AIIMS Nagpur and only after that the authorities would consider putting up the case before the ICMR.

“In the meantime, we have been sending samples to Akola lab, AIIMS Nagpur and from today to Sewagram Medical College,” he added.

The demand for setting up the lab was raised by Thakur in the cabinet meting on April 18. Health minister Rajesh Tope had sought Centre’s permission to open labs, each at a cost of around Rs35 lakh, at Nanded, Aurangabad, Jalna, Latur and Amravati.

The lab at Nanded has started its operations from Wednesday last.

Dr Prashant Thakare of microbiology department and Dr NA Ghanwate had also undergone training at AIIMS Nagpur for handling the Covid lab.

The varsity has already been supplied with bio-safety level 2 cabinets, RT PCR machine and personal protective equipment (PPEs).

Allaying apprehensions that setting up the lab on the campus would put students and employees at risk, Dr Rajesh Jaipurkar, pro-VC, said such apprehensions are unfounded. “Our lab is strictly according to ICMR norms,” he said. “ICMR has done video inspection and expressed satisfaction saying it is better than most other labs,” said Jaipurkar. 

“Samples come in a box and are opened in the lab only under ultraviolet lights. A chemical is applied to them that kills the virus. So there is no possibility of its spread on the campus,” he said.
