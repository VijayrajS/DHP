2020-04-24
JABALPUR: With four new cases on Thursday, Jabalpur’s corona tally has gone up to 31. Among the new patients is a PDS shop helper — which has raised concerns as he might have come in contact with a large number of people, said an official. 

This 20-year-old youth is the grandson of Jabalpur’s patient number 22 — who was tested positive after her death a couple of days ago. 

Officials however said that the shop where he works is in the area which is already a containment zone — which reduces the chances of spread further. District collector Bharat Yadav said, people who have come into the contact with four new patients are being identified and traced, and those who have been traced are being sent into quarantine. 

“After inviting details of travel history from people, we have now started to verify the data received so far, and if anyone has concealed information, then strict action would be taken,” said Yadav and added, “People are requested to maintain social distancing and adhere to the guidelines issued by the administration. If needed, complete lockdown may be ordered, and stricter measures taken.”
