Meerut: In two separate incidents, novel coronavirus scare pushed two men to commit suicide in Saharanpur and Shamli districts respectively. One of them included a symptomatic patient who was already quarantined in Shamli hospital. The other one, a Saharanpur resident, was a 38-year-old clerk in the Cane Development Board office in the district.In a note he left behind, the man said he was too scared of the outbreak to withstand it and hence was killing himself. According to police sources, the body of the deceased, identified as Adesh Saini, was first spotted by the neighbours hanging from a ceiling fan in his office.“Preliminary investigation revealed that Adesh Saini used to come to office daily. However, the office door remained open till late night on Wednesday. When inquisitive neighbours visited the office, Saini's body was found hanging from the ceiling fan. His family said he was suffering from depression for quite some time,” said Nakud police station incharge Sushil Kumar.In the Shamli case, the district magistrate has set up an inquiry. “The man was admitted to Shamli district hospital’s quarantine ward on March 31 as he had showed symptoms. His blood sample was also taken and sent to Meerut for tests whose results are awaited,” Shamli DM Jasjeet Kaur said.Earlier, on March 22, a 32-year-old man from Hapur who had developed symptoms of cold and cough committed suicide by slitting his throat with a shaving blade. In his suicide note, he said he feared he had Covid-19 and didn’t want to infect his children. Later, his test report came negative.In yet another case, a 23-year-old migrant labourer, who was quarantined in a school outside his village after he returned from NCR on March 28 in Fariya Pipariya village of Mitauli tehsil in Lakhimpur Kheri district, committed suicide late on Tuesday.
