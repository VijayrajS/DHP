Margao: Making a case for urgent state-wide comprehensive community testing for coronavirus, state Congress president Girish Chodankar cautioned chief minister Pramod Sawant against “rushing” to declare Goa a Covid-19-free state. 

Chodankar said data reveals that just 0.04% of Goa’s 16 lakh population has been tested. tnn
