CHENNAI: DMK president M K Stalin on Saturday asked the state government to reveal the number of Covid-19 rapid testing kits purchased, their cost, distribution and other details. He said the government should be transparent about the purchase of rapid testing kits as they are being used to test common people.

On Friday morning, the state received 24,000 rapid testing kits from China. They have been distributed to districts and hospitals have started testing people with them.

Stalin cited Chhattisgarh minister T S Singh Deo’s Tweet on the price of the kits his state has bought and sought a similar disclosure from the AIADMK-led government. “The Chhattisgarh minister has transparently announced the number of kits purchased, and their price. Similarly, the Tamil Nadu government should announce the number of kits bought, and their price. I am urging disclosure as there should be transparency in government administration,” he said in a Facebook post.

The Dravidian party leader also tagged Deo’s post which said: “We are procuring 75,000 high quality rapid testing kits at a benchmark price of Rs 337+GST from a South Korean company based in India, which has proven to be the lowest bidder. The rate we have been able to close at is the lowest in India.”

On April 17, Stalin had hit out at chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for his expectation that the number of fresh Covid-19 cases will reduce to zero and demanded expeditious steps to procure equipment, carry out rapid testing, besides measures for treatment, relief and rehabilitation.
