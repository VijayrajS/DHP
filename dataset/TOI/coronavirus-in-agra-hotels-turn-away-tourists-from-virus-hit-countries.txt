Coronavirus in Agra: Hotels turn away tourists from virus-hit countries
2020-03-05
AGRA: A day after the Centre announced immediate temporary suspension of visas and e-visas granted on or before Tuesday to visitors from Italy, Iran, S Korea and Japan, five star hotels in Agra have decided not to honour their existing bookings made by tourists from these countries.

Hospitality industry officials said this decision was also influenced by the district authorities’ warning that hotels would be sealed for a few days if any foreigner staying in such establishment was detected positive for coronavirus. A hotelier said since no businessman can afford closure of such establishments, they have decided to decline rooms to tourists from these “high risk” countries even if the guests have confirmed reservations.

“We will make full refund to them,” he said.
