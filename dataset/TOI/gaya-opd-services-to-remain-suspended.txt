2020-03-24
GAYA: As the number of coronavirus suspects grew in the district, OPD services have been suspended and in emergency situations, those needing immediate medical assistance have been advised to dial the dedicated number released by the district administration. Four teams have been formed to identify Covid-19 suspects and those with questionable travel history. 


According to DM Abhishek Singh, the practice of media briefing is being discontinued and mediapersons would be provided updates digitally.

Confirming the admission of suspects, the DM said those showing symptoms of the deadly virus have been kept in the isolation ward and those with a travel history have been put in the quarantine centres established for the purpose. More quarantine centres will be established, said the DM.

According to Dr NK Paswan, nodal officer of the anti-corona operations, samples collected from the isolation ward inmates are being sent for lab testing. Asked about the two air passengers from Thailand, Dr Paswan said their test reports were awaited and follow-up action would be taken after that. Till date, nearly two dozen samples have been sent for examination to the virological lab and all the reports received so far have been negative. The air passengers are stable.
