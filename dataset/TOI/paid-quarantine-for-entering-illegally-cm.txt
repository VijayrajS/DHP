Paid quarantine for entering Goa illegally: CM
2020-04-23
PANAJI: People entering Goa without permission from the state government authorities will be placed in paid quarantined, chief minister Pramod Sawant said.


Sawant said that some people have been entering Goa from other states through shorter routes and internal roads. 

“Those found crossing the border without permission will be arrested and sent to quarantine centres,” he said.

He said that those entering the state forcefully will be put in paid quarantine. Citing an example, Sawant said that one woman had arrived from Rajasthan and sought entry into Goa. 

She stayed at the Keri checkpost for nearly 24 hours, he said.

“She was allowed to enter the state, but we have placed her in institutional quarantine,” Sawant said. 

He also said that even if someone who owns a house and seeks entry into Goa will not be allowed to do so.

TOI on Wednesday reported that although the state government has sealed its borders, people appear to be finding internal roads and routes via jungles to enter Goa. 

Videos purportedly showing people taking short cuts to enter the state have gone viral on social media.
