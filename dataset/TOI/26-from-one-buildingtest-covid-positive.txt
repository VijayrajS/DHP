JAIPUR: Fourteen women among 26 people living in one building at Pano Ka Dariba locality of the Walled City tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. All of them are from West Bengal and they work in the city as house maids or labourers.


After their test results returned positive, they were shifted to the RUHS Hospital, which is a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre in the city. One woman of the 26 had left for Kolkata before her report came in. Since she tested positive, state health authorities immediately informed their counterparts in Kolkata, where she was taken to a hospital straight from the railway station on Tuesday.

“They have been staying in the same building on rent for the past few months,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I).

“The women work as house maids, while the men as labourers in factories,” said Dr Sharma.

Another woman from the building had gone to a government dispensary with symptoms of Jinfluenza-like illness on June 1.

Doctors sent her samples for Covid testing and her report returned positive on June 5.

Health department teams rushed to her house in Pano Ka Dariba area.

They found that she was staying in a congested building with 45 other people.

This woman was sent to RUHS Hospital for treatment and samples of the 45 others were taken the same day.

The test results of this lot came on Tuesday – 26 positive and 19 negative.
