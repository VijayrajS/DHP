2020-05-28
HASSAN: Hassan district has reported 25 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the tally to 137. Ten cases were reported on Tuesday and 15 cases were reported on Wednesday. 

As many as 14 out of the 15 patients tested positive on Wednesday have returned from Mumbai and one from Tamil Nadu. They tested positive on the 14th day of quarantine. This turns out to be a matter of concern as the state government in its recent guidelines has directed to restrict institutional quarantine for returnees to seven days. District minister JC Madhuswamy said he would raise this matter at a state level meeting on Thursday. 

Four policemen, including a PSI, are among those tested positive on Tuesday. On returning from Nippani after a weekâ€™s duty, they were quarantined directly, said Holenarsipur tahsildar KR Shreenivasa.
