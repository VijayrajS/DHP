Udupi: A man who was quarantined for 14 days after coming from Telangana, was sent home on Thursday. However, before he reached home, health officials called him and informed him that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and that he should not enter his house. He was then admitted to the designated Covid hospital in Udupi. All the 14 people who were in the quarantine centre with him, are in a state of panic now.

A group of 15 people had come to Udupi on May 4, and all of them were quarantined at Byndoor taluk for 20 days. After two tests were performed on the individual, though officials at the centre said that he tested negative for the novel coronavirus, it was later realised that it was a mistake. 

Deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha said, “There were three people with the same name at the quarantine centre, of whom two people tested negative and one person tested positive. Due to confusion, this man was sent home by the staff at the quarantine centre. Health official immediately realised the mistake and brought him to the designated Covid hospital in Udupi, and got him admitted there.

“This confusion was created by the person who was discharged, as he registered two people using his mobile number. All the other men with him at the quarantine centre need to remain in home quarantine for another 14 days,” he added. The patient denied that he had registered another person with the same name and mobile number, and alleged that it was a mistake committed by the authorities.
