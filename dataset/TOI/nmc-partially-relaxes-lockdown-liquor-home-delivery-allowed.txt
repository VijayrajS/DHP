NMC partially relaxes lockdown, liquor home delivery allowed
2020-05-14
Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Wednesday partially relaxed the lockdown in the city, after about seven weeks of complete closure. He has now allowed some shops to open and private offices to function at 15% capacity. Only home delivery of liquor has been permitted for permit holders within city, while liquor shops will be allowed to remain open in the rural areas of the district.

After Mundhe’s relaxation order in the afternoon, collector Ravindra Thakre issued an order late on Wednesday night permitting liquor shops to open in rural areas of the district from Friday. Home delivery has also been permitted. However, country liquor can’t be supplied through home delivery.

After NMC and collector’s permission to operate, liquor shop owners are waiting for orders from the excise department, which comes under the collector. The liquor shops will remain open from 9am to 6pm. The owners will have to draw circles in front of their shops on Thursday to ensure social distancing among their customers.

Mundhe and Thakre’s permission notwithstanding, liquor shop owners are not very keen on home delivery of liquor. “If we have to ensure home delivery, we will have to open our shutters. The moment we do it, people will throng our shops. If we refuse to sell them liquor, they may create ruckus and even damage our shops,” said Rajesh Chaurasia of PVK Wines. Chaurasia further said shop owners wanted government to suggest a safe way of doing business.

Some more shops selling non-essential goods will also be allowed to open, with many conditions. Only those which are stand-alone (single), neighbourhood (colony) and shops in residential complexes will be allowed to function. There is also a condition that there should not be more than five shops selling non-essential items, besides those selling essential goods, in a lane.

Even these shops will not be permitted to remain open on all days. Shops of electrical items, including those selling air coolers, hardware and building materials, will remain open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Auto spare shops, garages, puncture repair shops, shops selling oils and lubricants, opticians, stationery and hosiery will remain open on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.

Private offices can now function, but only at 15% capacity. Rest of the employees will have to work from home. Government offices can function at 33% capacity for junior staff. Earlier, it was only 5%.

Shop and office owners need not apply to NMC for permission to open their establishments. However, all these relaxations are not applicable to containment zones.

Schools, colleges, gymnasiums, cinema halls, saloons, malls etc will continue to remain closed. Autorickshaws, cycle-rickshaws, cabs etc will not be allowed to ply.
