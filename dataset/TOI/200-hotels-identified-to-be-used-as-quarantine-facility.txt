PANAJI: The state government has identified 200 hotels totalling 20,000 rooms to be used as quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients. The list of properties has been given to the district collectors, who after finalisation will issue orders for requisition.


Tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar said that 200 hotels have been shortlisted to keep quarantine facility ready for seafarers.



 Some properties will be managed by the state, while others will be earmarked as paid facilities.

“Those who want more amenities can opt for paid quarantine,” he said.

Amid growing tension over the seafarers’ issue, on Wednesday, chief minister Pramod Sawant had said that seafarers would be evacuated in phases. However, the decision would be made within three days by the ministry of home affairs, he had said.

An attempt by wives of 11 seafarers, two days ago, to sit on hunger strike outside the chief minister’s residence was foiled after they were detained by police for violating Section 144 of CrPC that has been in force since last month. 

The Section bars gathering of five or more persons.

A section of seafarers has accused the government of not doing enough to bring home stranded seafarers even as some are in dire state. Some seafarers have even taken to social media during last few days urging the government to help them.

Health minister Vishwajit Rane had said that his ministry will require a 21-day notice to keep the facilities ready when the seafarers arrive in Goa. The seafarers will have to be brought in batches and quarantined, he had said.

An exact figure of stranded seafarers is not available yet, but it is estimated that it could be well over 7,000.

A senior official said all seafarers will require to be quarantined, either 14 or 28 days depending on which country they came from and all symptomatic seamen be tested for Covid-19.
