Life in the time of lockdown: Web series, ludo & more...
2020-03-23
INDORE: Binge watching web series to playing ludo and carrom, Indoreans struck a balance between the old ways and the new to keep themselves entertained during Janata Curfew on Sunday.

For safety of near and dear ones, Indoreans followed the appeal made by PM and stayed at home while practising a 14-hour self-imposed curfew.

“Since all of my family members were home on Sunday, we decided to binge watch web series. We had made lunch and dinner and then started watching series at 11am and finished it by 8:00pm. None of us stepped out of the house,” said Shivani Wadekar, an IT engineer from Mumbai, who is staying in city and working from home. Similarly, people revisited old traditional games like ludo and carrom and played it with family members. “We went to the store and bought three board games and cards to play on Sunday. I believe that the situation is going to continue and we should have something to keep ourselves entertained,” said Rahul Sharma, professor, resident of Bhanwarkuan. 

Societies also encouraged people to stay home by restricting use of common gardens and play areas. 

“We had shut our clubhouse and garden since past one week and common doors have also been permanently opened such that people don’t touch the handles while passing through the doors. People followed Janta Curfew in the township religiously,” said Madalsa Vyas, director of a township at Bypass. 

Some dog owners claimed that they also trained their pets to use washroom at home to avoid taking them for a walk. “The times are going to be really bad in future and so we should make sure that our pets are trained,” said Shibby Thomas, a student. 

Some working locals planned to spring clean their houses to pass time. “I have a full-time help at home but I decided to help her clean the house and cupboards since we had nothing to do on Sunday,” said Himani Victor.
