Patients can't use mobile in UP's Covid-19 hospitals
2020-05-24
LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh medical education department banned the use of cell phones by patients in level-2 and level-3 Covid-19 hospitals in the state. 

Issued by director general medical education, Dr KK Gupta, the order was sent to all institutions and medical colleges across the state.

Referring to the use of cellphones by patients in Covid-19 hospitals of the state, the order said: "Patients admitted to level-2 and level-3 Covid hospitals in state will not be allowed to carry their cell phones in the ward as it involves risk of spreading the infection." 


2 phones will be provided to in charge
The order, however, said two dedicated cell phones will be provided to each centre in charge for communication purposes.

The move comes about a week after a report in the British Medical Journal questioning the use of cell phones in hospital setting amid Covid-19. Written by a group of doctors from AIIMS Raipur, it said: “Mobile phone surfaces are a peculiar ‘high-risk’ surface, which can directly come in contact with the face or mouth, even if hands are properly washed and one study indicates that some healthcare workers use phones every 15 minutes to two hours.”

In wake of the same, they recommended restrictions on use of mobile phones in healthcare institutions besides warning that such devices can be a potential carrier of the virus.

Health experts, however, have questione the move. “I don’t find the move logical. Many patients feel stressed and even phobic to the idea of isolation. Cell phone keeps them engaged and diverted. If there is any proven risk, the authorities may recommend sanitizing the device or recommending the use of head phones etc,” said Dr Ashok Mishra, former CMO, UP government.
