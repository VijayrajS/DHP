District magistrate BN Singh said the company where the executive from Delhi had visited in Noida's Sector 80 has shut down its premises till March 20. "While 29 people who came in close contact with him have been screened and quarantined, CCTV footage in the office is being scanned to look for any further contacts with the executive," he said. 

A list of 717 people has also been handed over to the health department by the company where the executive worked, officials said.

Fortunately, the DM said, the executive who'd returned from Italy and his last working day at the company outfit was March 6, was sitting in a separate cabin, which was away from the main factory. "The majority of staff, about 700, were in another building. But still, as a precautionary measure we are in the process of checking all staff," he said.

 "Now that we have got a list of all the company employees, we are contacting them to check for symptoms of flu, cough or breathlessness. They have been asked to report any such symptoms to the district health department," said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical officer of GB Nagar. "The company office has been sanitized, and samples of about 5-7 people taken from the premises for further testing. We are following up with all precautions and are taking all necessary steps," said Bhargava.
