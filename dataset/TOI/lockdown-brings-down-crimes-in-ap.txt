Lockdown brings down crimes in Andhra Pradesh
2020-04-06
VIJAYAWADA: The number of crimes—such as rape, murder and theft—recorded in the state has dropped during the nationwide lockdown. On average, at least 50 property offences (burglaries, theft, murder for gain) are registered in a day across the state. This number has dropped drastically to four to six cases a day.


At least 50 to 55 bodily offences—such as murder, kidnapping, abductionand the like—were registered almost every day. But the police say they have received only three to five complaints a day in the past two weeks. White collar crimes too have reduced from 25 cases a day to one or two per day. Cyber crimes have reduced to almost zero. The police have not registered any case related to ganja trade in the past two weeks.

Speaking to TOI, Vijayawada police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said, “We normally register a good number of property offence cases and other crimes. But in the past two weeks, we have received very few complaints. Cases related to rape, crime against women, property offences and cyber crimes have drastically decreased. We suspect this is due to Covid-19 lockdown. The law and order situation is also good in Vijayawada city. Except cases related to defying the lockdown and traffic violations, registration of other crimes are very low.”

“In the past two weeks, only two property offences (burglary in a liquor shop and cash stolen at a transport office) were reported in Vizag city. Those cases too were solved. We strongly believe that the lockdown and coronavirus scare are the reason for this drop in cases. Since majority of the people have been staying home, criminals have found it difficult to commit property offences,” said V Suresh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (crimes).
