District courts doing their part to fight the virus
2020-03-18
KOCHI: The Ernakulam district judiciary has started social-distancing and break-the-chain initiatives to prevent the coronavirus spread by restricting presence of people on court premises. As a first step, all district courts under the jurisdiction of the principal district judge will have just one entry and exit point.

Stop memos have been sent to all witnesses who have been issued summons by courts . “All those summons that have been sent out earlier to witnesses have been withdrawn and no harsh punishment will be given to any witness or accused who has not come to the court. All such cases will be notified as adjourned until the situation becomes normal,” said district judge Dr Kauser Edappagath.

He said around 50 jail inmates accompanied by around 150 policemen are brought to the court premises and instructions have been given to all courts to conduct video conferencing in jails.

A meeting of all judicial officers along with stakeholders met in Kochi on Tuesday during which several steps were adopted. This follows instructions of the Kerala high court chief justice. Judges of various courts in Ernakulam district, advocates, lawyers, paralegal volunteers and an NGO, Justice Brigade, will work to implement these directives.

Apart from setting up a kiosk where documents of all persons coming to the courts will be checked by paralegal volunteers, only those who will need to enter will be allowed. “We have given instructions to advise them to stay away. We will be enforcing a sanitizing campaign to be followed by all entering the premises,” said Pradeep, president, Justice Brigade, a lawyers’ group trained in disaster management which started functioning during the floods of 2018.
