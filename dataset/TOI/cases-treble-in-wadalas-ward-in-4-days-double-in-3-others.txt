2020-04-23
MUMBAI: Antop Hill, with its slum pockets, is emerging as yet another Covid-19 hotspot in the city. The area comes under F-North ward (Matunga-Wadala-Sion belt), where the number of coronavirus cases has increased almost threefold in just four days. In some of the worst-affected wards, including A (Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point, Churchgate, Fort), F-South (Parel, Sewri, Naigaum) and L (Kurla, Chunabhatti), Covid-19 cases have doubled in the corresponding period. Thirteen of the city’s 24 wards now have over 100 Covid-19 cases each.

F-North as of April 21 had 228 cases, up from 79 on April 17. The increase in F-South was from 51 to 119, in A ward from 49 to 118, and in L ward from 115 to 240. Much of the increase in these wards has come in packed slum pockets. BMC came to know about clusters of new positive patients after organising fever clinics.
