Traffic violations on rise on Trichy roads as lockdown eases
2020-06-10
Trichy: Vehicular movement on Trichy city’s arterial roads has returned to normalcy post the lockdown relaxation and so have the traffic violations. Residents feel that the number of traffic violations has gone up since the law enforcers have not acted tough against the violators. Even though Trichy police were not very strict with violations like overspeeding even before the lockdown, those violating the helmet rule were rigorously brought to book. This ensured that the residents largely fell in line and wore helmets. But post the lockdown many commuters have started violating the helmet rule too. The other traffic violations that largely went unpunished before the lockdown period have further intensified. 

“Police presence should be ensured at arterial roads and traffic signals. Overspeeding has become a menace post the lockdown relaxation and youngsters are terrorising city roads,” M Sekaran, member of road safety council added. Traffic signal jumping has surged at major signals like head post office signal, Major Saravanan roundabout signal and district Court signal. Although police constables are present at the junctions, they are being mere spectators to the violations, locals lamented.

Commuters often ignored the no-entry boards during the lockdown period. But even after the relaxations were announced and more vehicles took to the roads, people continue to do violate the one-way rules. Acknowledging the surge in violations, Trichy city traffic police sources said that they have been suggesting RTOs to suspend the driving license of those committing traffic violations like traffic signal jumping using the e-challan system. “Helmetless riders are being penalised, so are the two-wheeler riders jumping traffic signals,” a police officer told TOI.
