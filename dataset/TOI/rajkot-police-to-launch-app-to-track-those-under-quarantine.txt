2020-03-29
Rajkot: In order to keep track of those people who have been put under home quarantine, the cyber cell of the Rajkot police has designed a mobile application.“With this app, we will be able to monitor the movements of those placed under home quarantine 24X7. Under this procedure, the cops will be visiting the homes of those under quarantine and downloading the app on their cellphones,” said Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agrawal on Saturday. “Once the app is installed on their phones, the quarantined people will have to send their photographs on this app every two hours. If a quarantined person steps out of his house, his location can be traced through this app,” added Agrawal.
