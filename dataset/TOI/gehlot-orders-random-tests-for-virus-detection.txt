JAIPUR: With growing number of Covid-19 patients in the state, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday directed authorities to conduct random tests for detection of cases. 

He also appealed to the members of the Tablihi Jamaat to voluntarily come forward for tests in the larger interest of humanity, society and the country. 

Gehlot held a high-level review meeting on the pandemic at his residence.

His directions came following the reports stating that people of a community were not cooperating with health workers and police teams going for screening in their localities especially in Ramganj here where 33 cases of the virus have been detected so far.

He urged that random tests will enable the state to get the exact status of infections. 

He also said those who have recent travel history and are witnessing symptoms should not hide it and come forward for tests. 

“Random tests in the districts will enable health officials get the exact status of the infection in the state. We should also focus on areas where tourists frequent,” Gehlot told authorities at the meeting.

The chief minister also appealed to members of Tablighi Jamaat who recently returned from the Nizamuddin congregation in New Delhi to come forward for tests to enable the government and health officials check the infection.

Gehlot also urged people to practise religious activities at their homes.

“This is in the large interest of the country and the state. The Nizamuddin congregation should have been stopped despite all objections and resistance. I will also urge police to take action against those defying the lockdown,” he added. 

His appeal came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conferencing of chief ministers jand urged for faster screening.
