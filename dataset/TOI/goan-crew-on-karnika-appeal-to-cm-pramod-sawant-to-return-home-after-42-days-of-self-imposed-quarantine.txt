2020-04-29
PANAJI: The 93 Goans working as crew on board the ship Karnika have written to chief minister Pramod Sawant requesting that they be placed under home quarantine and not the mandatory 14-day institutional quarantine upon their return to Goa.

In their letter, the crew said that they’ve been under self-imposed quarantine on board the vessel for 42 days, and that they cannot afford to pay the daily quarantine charge of Rs 3,000. They said that most of them haven’t completed their contracts, and thus they haven’t got their expected wages. They also said that they’re mostly the sole earning member of the family, and that they have no other income.
