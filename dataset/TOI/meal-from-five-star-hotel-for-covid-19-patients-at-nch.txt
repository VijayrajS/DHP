Meal from five-star hotel for Covid-19 patients at New Civil Hospital
2020-04-22
SURAT: Eating out at the five-star hotels has become a dream, even for the Surat’s elite during the lockdown. But this is not the case with some 250-odd Covid-19 patients recuperating at the New Civil Hospital (NCH) here.

These patients undergoing treatment at NCH get food prepared by city’s five-star hotel.

Mariott Surat at Athwalines has come forward to feed the patients after they came to know that those admitted at NCH were unhappy with the quality of food being served to them.

Few days ago, Majura MLA Harsh Sanghavi was flooded with complaints from the NCH patients regarding the quality of food.

Talking with TOI, Sanghavi said, “I contacted the management of Mariott Surat for their help and they readily agreed to feed the patients with hygienic food twice a day starting from Tuesday.”

According to Sanghavi, a city-based NGO, Shree Laxminath Seva Samiti has come forward to feed about 271 patients with suspected symptoms admitted at the isolation ward of NCH with quality meals twice a day.

A Covid-19 positive patient at NCH on condition of anonymity said, “For the last many days, the quality of food had deteriorated. The rice would be half-cooked and the rotis were stale and stinking. The quality of food from the five-star hotel is awesome. This is first time that I am eating food from five-star hotel.”

A senior doctor at NCH said, “Some NGO was supplying food packets to the patients at the Covid-19 hospital. However, patients were unhappy with the quality of food.” 

Amit Mehta, general manager, of Mariott Surat told TOI, “The meals cooked for the patients is balanced, nutritious and made in consultation with the doctors at the hospital. We will continue to serve two meals a day to the patients as part of our contribution in the fight against coronavirus.”

Mehta added, “We are also feeding the police and hospital staff at the SMIMER hospital.”
