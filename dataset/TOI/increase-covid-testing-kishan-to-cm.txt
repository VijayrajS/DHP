2020-06-10
HYDERABAD: Expressing concern over the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Secunderabad and Greater Hyderabad, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy on Tuesday wrote a letter to chief minister K Chandrasekha Rao urging him to increase the testing in the containment zones of the twin cities.

In a two-page letter to the CM, Kishan said that it is important to make sure that results of the tests are known immediately and steps taken in such a way that local hospitals are made active to identify people with health problems. Kishan suggested that disinfectants should be sprayed in the houses and streets of Covid-19 patients. 

Kishan said he has been receiving representations from people expressing concern over the rising number of Covid cases in the city. He advised the CM that by recognising the aged people and others in the early stages, the virus spread could be contained and several lives saved.

He said it was the responsibility of both the state and the central governments to control the situation as expeditiously as possible. He appealed to the CM to follow the advisory issued by the ministry of health on Tuesday after a review meeting with 10 states where Covid-19 was spreading fast.
