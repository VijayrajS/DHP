Vijayawada: Apartments at forefront of Covid battle
2020-05-29
VIJAYAWADA: From providing essential needs to quarantining foreign-returnees to ensuring disinfection, apartments and housing societies across Vijayawada have been coming up their own set of guidelines in the city.

While some of these are reasonable such as washing hands and wearing masks, certain apartment associations have taken stringent means such as stopping domestic maid services, banning delivery of essential services like milk, vegetables and food.

“We had first closed all entry points to the building and left only one of the gates open to keep track of who is coming in and going out. The residents who go out for work comply in washing their hands and feet before stepping into the building,” K Mahesh, a bank employee residing at Sripriya Apartments in Kannur, said. 

Another apartment building in One Town area, where some of the recent foreign returnees reside, the neighbours took it upon themselves to ensure that all of their essential needs are catered to. “We created a WhatsApp group to address some of the rumours of Covid-19 instances in the neighbourhood. The primary issue was trust,” said Srinivas Rao, a bank employee.

Apartments in containment zones have more stricter rules in place. For instance, JGR Towers in Karmika Nagar had took it upon themselves in maintaining strict timings between 8 am to 11 am for residents to go out and purchase essentials. 

Bigger gated communities in Penamaluru where a couple of Covid-19 positive cases have been reported had closed off common facilities such as swimming pool, gym and the clubhouse.
