2020-03-20
CHENNAI: While a group of health workers were combing through the streets of a residential colony in the city to track contacts of 20-year-old patient who tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, another group of officials were using technology to track mobile numbers of passengers who travelled with him in the reserved compartment of the Delhi-Chennai train that reached Chennai on March 12 and other places he travelled within Chennai until he got himself admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on March 17. 



A team of health department officials and police are working on cluster-based position tracking system to track down members of the public who were within the close range from a Covid-19 control room. Those who were in contact with him or who could have been exposed to the virus will be asked to self-quarantine for at least 14 days, said heath secretary Beela Rajesh. The department had already piloted this technology with one of the patients who went to Colombo from Chennai. 

“A team of health department officials along with police are using data from mobile companies to track a cluster of mobile phones around. They will be called, visited and screened by our health workers. They will also be counselled about self-quarantine,” she said. However, for this the patient should have carried his mobile phone with him every time he travelled. 

“We have asked the railways for the physical list of the passengers who travelled with him on train,” she said. The state will release a flow chart of his movement to inform people by Thursday, she said. Public health officials said that already at least seven of his close contacts have been sent to a government quarantine facility and are being watched by health workers. 

“They will be moved to a government hospital if they develop symptoms. Samples have also been drawn from close contacts,” he said.
