Gorakhpur: In order to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Gorakhpur, outsiders entering the district are being screened and stamped at two spots. More than 5000 people have been sent to home quarantine.

Thousands of migrant workers returning from metro cities to their native towns, are being screened and provided with food packets at Nausad Crossing and at Railway Bus Station.

“People arriving from outside are being screened and stamped at the two spots before being permitted to carry on the forward journey. They have also been directed to stay in home quarantine for at least 14 days,” said Gorakhpur CMO Srikant Tiwari. 

“If anyone is found running a temperature, or shows other symptoms of Covid-19, the person is send to the district hospital. So far, more than 5000 people have been sent to home quarantine and 10 samples of suspected corona patients were sent for test, but all of them tested negative,” added Tiwari.

“As many as 80 teams have been deployed for screening outsiders. Each team goes door to door to screen families—especially those with outsiders—and, sticks notice outside the house for home quarantine as per need,” said the CMO.
