ICMR nod to Goa firmâ€™s device for Covid-19 testing
2020-04-05
PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Friday night allowed use of Goa-based Molbio Diagnostics' portable devices to test more people, especially from the district- or taluka-level, to rule out Covid-19 infection.

Known as Truenat, the fully automated battery-operated testing devices by Molbio are simple to use and provide results within one hour of sample collection without requiring any special storage conditions, ICMR officials said, adding that the device allowed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing .

The results can be seen on the screen or printed or shared wirelessly through GPRS, wi-fi and Bluetooth to any remote device/ server. Every device can store up to 20,000 results automatically, they said.

"The approval will allow testing of more people at district and even sub-taluka level without the need of air-conditioned laboratories," Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, told TOI.

Founder director and chief technical officer of Molbio Diagnostics Chandrashekar Nair said the company had installed 257 units in Andhra Pradesh, which were being used for TB and H1N1 testing. "These installed units can potentially do Covid-19 testing as well. These have been set up in community health centres and primary health centres, eliminating the need for moving samples for testing," he said.

Dr Anoop Kumar, the consultant on Covid-19 to the Kerala government and the company's key opinion leader, said the collection medium provided with the kit killed the virus immediately after transfer of the sample. "Thus, precautions and personal protective equipment are required only during the sample collection process," he added.
