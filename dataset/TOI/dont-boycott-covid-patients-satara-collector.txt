Don’t boycott Covid patients: Satara collector
2020-06-12
Kolhapur: Satara district collector Shekhar Singh has warned co-operative housing societies of strict action if they are found boycotting Covid-19 patients or health workers. 

Stating that the societies must enforce directives laid out by the local administration, Singh said that many patients who have recovered from the contagion or are suffering from it are facing non-cooperation from their neighbours or society members. 

Singh’s warning comes in the wake of complaints against certain housing societies. District administration officials said it has come to their notice that people who provide essential services to Covid patients or health workers, too, are not allowed to enter society premises.
