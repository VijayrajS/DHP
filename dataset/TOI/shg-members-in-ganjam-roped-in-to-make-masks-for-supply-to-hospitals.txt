BERHAMPUR: The district administration has roped in women self help groups (SHGs) to make masks to tide over the shortage due to increase in demand after the Covid-19 pandemic. 


Around 100 SHG members in Aska, Berhampur, Hinjili and Ganjam have started making masks. The supply is expected to start from Tuesday after verification of samples. 

In the first phase, the masks will be supplied to all hospitals after getting formal order from the chief district medical officer (CDMO), said district social welfare officer (DSWO) Manorama Reddy. Though the price of each mask is yet to be fixed, it might be around Rs 25, she said. 

“The SHG members are working overtime to supply adequate number of masks,” said Minati Panda, a supervisor of SHGs in Berhampur. She said 40 women members of two SHGs divided into two groups are making the masks. “Our members are familiar with tailoring having stitched school uniforms for children. At least 20 of them in Nandik village in Hinjili block have been selected for making of masks on the direction of the district administration,” said child development project officer (Hinjili) Subhashree Patra.

Chief district medical officer (Ganjam) R Jagadeesh Patnaik said they have distributed around 2,000 disposable masks in different hospitals for use by health personnel. “We have asked doctors to use the face mask while treating patients in hospitals,” he said.
