Aurangabad: The cybercrime branch police station located in the police commissionerate premises was sealed after a police constable was tested positive for Covid-19 infection on Wednesday. The 22 other police personnel working in the police station too have been quarantined at Mahsul Praobhidini.

Sources in the cybercrime branch said that deputy commissioner of police (headquarter) Meena Makwana informed that the tests would be carried out soon.

Police authorities informed that the 28-year old constable’s father, also a policeman, was posted with the civic body staff and tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday. This was followed by testing his family members including his son and daughter-in-law, who were tested positive. The family was staying in the same premises and their house too have been partially sealed. 

“Our biggest concern is that the constable, who tested positive on Wednesday, was looking after the e-pass system and would daily interact with several police officers and constables at the CP office. You never know, who all have been infected,” said a senior police officer, while suggesting that everyone at CP office should undergo swab tests to rule out any infection.

Health authorities informed that 44 fresh Cvoid-19 cases were registered taking the total number of cases to 1,120 in Aurangabad on Wednesday morning. In addition to this, three more succumbed to infection while undergoing treatment at Government Medical College and Hospital, thus taking the death toll to 39 so far.

Among the three deaths included a 50-year-old woman from Rehmaniya Colony, 80-year-old resident of Indiranagar and 55-year old man from Jaibhimnagar area of the city. Out of the 39 casualties so far, 36 cases have been reported from GMCH.
