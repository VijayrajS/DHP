Covid-19 rumours bring down demand, price of chicken in Madurai
2020-03-16
MADURAI: The demand for fish and mutton has increased in the city following unfounded rumours that Covid-19 spreads through consumption of chicken, apart from bird flu cases reported in Kerala.


Although doctors have dispelled the rumours stating that the meat is safe for consumption after cooking it well, awareness on the topic seems to be low.

Fish and mutton stalls were found crowded, whereas there were fewer takers for chicken in the city. However, the demand has not come down for indigenous chicken varieties. The price of fish has increased by around 20% due to the increased demand in the last one week. 

M Ashraful, a chicken vendor from Anna Nagar, said that he used to sell at least 50kg of chicken every Sunday, but it came down to 20-30kg this Sunday. “One kg of chicken, which was sold for not less than Rs 160 until a couple of weeks ago, is now being sold at Rs 100. However, there are only a few takers for it. We hope the government will take measures to inform the right message to the people,” said Ashraful.

This is similar to the formalin scare a few weeks back after a check was conducted food safety officials at Karimedu market, following which the demand for fish came down. “The price has picked up in the last one week. The price of all varieties of fishes has gone up by at least 20% this weekend,” said K Vinayagam, a seller from Nelpettai fish market.

A source from the prison department said that the demand for mutton sold by the inmates has increased this week as the crowd was bigger than usual this Sunday. Many, who came late, had to return empty handed as it was sold out. 

V Chandru, a mutton stall owner, said that they have not increased price of mutton despite increased demand and continue to sell it for Rs 750/kg.
