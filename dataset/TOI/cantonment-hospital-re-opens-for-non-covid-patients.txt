Cantonment hospital re-opens for non-Covid patients
2020-05-28
Nashik: The Cantonment Board, Deolali (CBD) hospital was opened on Tuesday for non-Covid patients over three weeks after it was declared dedicated Covid health centre.

A separate arrangement has been made for Covid patients within the hospital with proper precautions to ensure that Covid-19 and non-Covid patients do not come in contact with one another. 

The hospital was closed for non-Covid patients from May 2 following which the patients were forced to go all the way to Nashik Road Bytco hospital. 

Taking into account the hardships faced by the people, the hospital authorities had made a separate OPD arrangement in three rooms of a school belonging to the CBD.

Meanwhile, recently, there were no Covid-19 related patients at the hospital on Saturday and Sunday. This prompted the members of Cantoment Board Deolali to put up a demand of reopening the hospital for non-Covid patients.

Officials said that they had also got instructions from the district health department that since the flow of Covid-19 patients was negligent in and around Deolali Camp, the hospital can resume non-Covid related services.
