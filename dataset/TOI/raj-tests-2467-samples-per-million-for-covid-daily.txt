JAIPUR: Rajasthan now tests 2,467 persons per million for Covid-19 infection, a major increase from just 80 samples till March 31. 

“Having tested more than 1,85,000 samples till date, the average has reached 2,467 samples per million, one of the highest in the country,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health). 

While antibody-based rapid test, which was advocated by the Indian Council for Medical Research, failed in the state allegedly due to “faulty” rapid kits, the state government focused on expanding its RT-PCR testing facilities at 20 major centres. On March 2, there was no dedicated laboratory in the state to give confirmatory Covid-19 test results. At that time, the health department had to send the samples to National Institute of Virologyin Pune. 

“We have made tremendous progress as far as the RT-PCR based testing capacity is concerned. From zero as on March 2 when the first case was detected, we can now test about 10,500 samples a day,” said Singh. While expanding testing facilities in the state, the health department had faced initial hiccups due to short supply of RT PCR kits, but now the supply has been streamlined. To expand it further, the government is starting testing samples of suspected patients in Jhunjhunu from Wednesday. “We have received permission from ICMR and also received a nod from AIIMS, Jodhpur for quality control. We will start tests at our centre,” said Dr SK Kaler, principal medical officer, Jhunjhunu district hospital.
