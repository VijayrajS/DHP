Containment, screening, identification can help beat virus: Health minister
2020-04-12
As Covid-19 cases areincreasing daily, how is your preparedness?Since March 2 when the first case was reported in our state, we have been working to ensure that there is no compromise on containment efforts and medications. Initially, we did not have testing facilities and had to get test reports from Pune. Now, we have 8 testing facilities across the state with a capacity of 2,500 tests per day. We have constituted rapid response teams who are experts in dealing with the pandemic. Collective efforts helped us to make Bhilwara a success story. After Bhilwara, where is the focus now? We have 40 areas under curfew. Out of 33 districts, things flared up in 24 districts. Out of these affected districts, we have 10 where we have reported more than 10 cases. Now focus is on the whole state. So far we have done 25,000 tests, one of the highest in the country.Ramganj now has more than 200 cases. How it is different from Bhilwara? Both are different demographically. In Ramganj, we have a population of more than 2.5 lakh which was initially scared to come for tests. Now they are cooperating. We have divided the area into 30 clusters and blocks. We have already taken almost 2,400 samples from Ramganj. I believe containment, screening and identification of patients is the key to success.In other states, health workers are complaining of lack of PPE kits and other gadgets? Do we have enough? We have 19,535 PPE kits on standby and nearly 1.10 lakh N-95 masks. We have also announced insurance of Rs 50 lakh for kin of health workers in case of death.Are you worried with increased numbers of patients? The ray of hope for us is that out of those who tested positive so far, we have 14 per cent patients of age bracket 60-80 years, 70 per cent in the age group of 20-40 and 16 per cent in the bracket of 0-20 years. Because of the lockdown and the curfew, we saved people of 60-80 years from getting infected. My feeling is that since we have 70 per cent patients between 20 and 40 years, they will get well soon.
