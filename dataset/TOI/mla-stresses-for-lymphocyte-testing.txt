NASHIK: Nashik Central MLA Devayani Pharande has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to conduct tests of lymphocytes for early detection of Covid 19. 


Reffering to the research papers that she has attached to the letter sent to the prime minister, the MLA said, “Besides the regular testing the testing of lymphocytes may also be done for earlier diagnosis as in initial stage of onset of Covid-19, lymphocytes are seen to have reduced resulting in lymphocytopenia.”

The MLA, an expert microbiology, claimed that the step would help in early diagnosis of the indications of Covid 19 patients and help in early intervention in the treatment. 

The MLA also has proposed testing of one person per family in the affected cities, towns and villages on priority basis. “Microbiology postgraduate students may be utilized for the project,” the MLA said referring to the letter by Microbiologists Society, India, where they have said they were willing to join the task. 

Similarly, BJP corporator from Nashik Varsha Bhalerao, who is also the member of standing committee Nashik Municipal Corporation and Tree Conservation Committee, has also written to Modi drawing his attention of utilising the unused ventilators personally owned by people.
