PUNE: A mobile application which helps access the nearest Covid care hospitals, laboratories and ambulance service in Mumbai and Pune for early detection of cases to help reduce mortality rate is on the anvil.


Additional chief secretary Nitin Kareer, who chaired a review meeting with the Pune district administration, said such information would help citizens and the administrations.



“The mobile application will ensure that citizens have the entire data of bed availability at hospitals, ambulance services, testing facilities at their finger tips. The administration can monitor patients are catered to as hospitals will have to upload the availability of beds,’‘he said.

Technical advisor to the state government Subhash Salunkhe said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in a review meeting supported it. 

“Such facilities would help a Covid-19 patient’s first contact or high-risk contact check for beds. Comorbid patients too could be admitted quickly. There will be no delay if the information is put out in public domain,” he said.

Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar who launched a dashboard to showcase availability of beds in Pune district told TOI the website can be accessed and a special mobile application will be ready in two days.
