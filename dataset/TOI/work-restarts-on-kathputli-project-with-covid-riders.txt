Delhi: Work restarts on Kathputli project, with Covid riders
2020-05-08
NEW DELHI: The construction work of DDA’s much-delayed Kathputli Colony in situ slum redevelopment project has restarted amid the lockdown with necessary safety measures. 

Arranging manpower for the construction work, however, is proving to be a challenge.

“We had over 500 workers before the ban on construction to check pollution. After that, it was Holi and crop cutting season followed by Covid-19 lockdown,” said Navin M Raheja, CMD of Raheja Developers Limited which is carrying out the redevelopment project.

“During the lockdown, we are left with less than 250 workers on the site who have been provided accommodation, food, sanitation and medical care throughout,” he added.

Raheja said that work has started on full-scale and all protocols of safety and distancing are being followed. “We are looking at absorbing more manpower from within the city and have requested for transfer of skilled workers languishing in shelter camps,” he told TOI.

The structure and finishing work for the project has started simultaneously and if we are able to retain the current strength of workers, possession to the first batch may be offered within 120 working days subject to availability of external infrastructure, Raheja claimed.

“The construction site is regularly sanitised and all packaged material, pipes and fittings will be disinfected,” he added.
