THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC ex-president and Congress leader V M Sudheeran has urged the government to shut down bars and sales outlets of foreign liquor in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.

IMA state control unit for Covid-19 also demanded closure of bars as the crowd gathering there would be vulnerable. 

In his letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, a copy of which has been marked to health, revenue and excise ministers, Sudheeran said there is no justification on the part of the government to allow the functioning of sales outlets of IMFL when the government even took the extreme step of discontinuing the assembly session. He said a question has arisen among the public on why the government has allowed the beverages outlets and liquor selling places to function even in such a grave scenario. He added that the governmentâ€™s approach of allowing the liquor sales outlets to function is condemnable and is gross injustice to the people of the state. 

Sudheeran urged that the same rules that have been applied to other places where there are likely to be gatherings should be applied to beverages outlets and liquor selling points also and added that the government should not play with the lives of the people. 

At the same time, he also lauded the government move to impose regulations in educational institutions, theatres, tourist places and other public places and government functions.
