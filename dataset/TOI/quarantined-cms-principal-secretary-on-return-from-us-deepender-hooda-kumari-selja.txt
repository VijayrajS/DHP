CHANDIGARH: Top leaders and officials of Haryana are quarantining themselves as a precautionary measure. These include principal secretary to the chief minister, Rajesh Khullar, Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda and Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja. 


Khullar opted to quarantine himself at his residence in Chandigarh on his return from the United States on March 20. He along with 28 persons, who include his staff and security guards, will be under observation till April 3. Sources said Khullar had not shown any symptoms that require testing for Covid-19.

Deepender and Selja too have opted for self-quarantine and have cancelled all their programmes for the next 15 days. Both were among the MPs who had called on President Ram Nath Kovind and had come in contact with BJP leader Dushyant Singh, who was present at the party that was attended by singer Kanika Kapoor in Lucknow, who later tested positive for Covid-19. 

Deepender has urged the government to take adequate steps for the poor and those suffering losses in business during the lockdown period in Haryana. He is interacting with the masses through his social media accounts.

Selja is also active through social media, including Twitter. In her tweet, Selja complimented the people of Haryana for the success of 'janata curfew'. She also asked the state government to ensure that interests of common men, especially daily wagers and hawkers, were not harmed during the period of lockdown in seven districts of the state.
