2020-05-18
Panaji: The state government is looking at enhancing its Covid-19 facilities in preparation for possible increase in patient load with people entering the state. Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Sunday said that there is scope for increasing the bed capacity of the Covid-19 hospital in Margao from 100 to 160.

“With asymptomatic patients, we can manage with a 100-bedded hospital. About 20 to 25 patients requiring ventilator support can also be managed there,” Sawant said, while talking about the rising cases and the need to upgrade existing facilities to offset the possible increase in patient load.In the last three days, the state has seen 22 cases, all of whom have travel history. The figures were expected to rise by late Sunday evening.

If the patient load increases, we will have to look for other hospitals, and we have kept our options open, Sawant said.“Different options are being considered, but if we control people coming from outside, I’m confident that the cases will not rise,” he said.

Except for two patients, 16 others under treatment in the Covid-19 hospital were asymptomatic. “We are confident they will recover after treatment,” he said. He said the strategy adopted by the Goa government is completely different from that of other states. “Ours is the only state where incoming people are permitted entry only after they are tested,” he said.

He said not all Covid-19 patients need ventilator support. “Even a symptomatic patient with respiratory problems can be managed with simple treatment. Complications can arise in patients with diabetes, or those above 60 years of age. 

“Such patients may need ventilator support,a nd we have made provisions for the necessary equipment,” he said.
