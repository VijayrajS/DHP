2020-05-06
Dehradun: Those waiting in a queue for their turn to purchase liquor at the Government Wine and Whisky Shop in Doiwala on Tuesday jumped out of their skins when a voice announced on a loudspeaker “No alcohol for those not wearing masks”. Everyone instantly covered their faces with whatever they could find. 

In a few minutes, a group of men wearing masks made to resemble the novel coronavirus emerged, carrying placards of relevant advice dispensed by ‘Corona Chacha’, a character that has been created by the Doiwala municipal council to drive home the message of social distancing and other precautions to be taken against Covid-19.

The idea of the character is the brainchild of Vijay Chauhan, the executive officer of Doiwala municipal council who also dresses up for the part, complete with a blazing red mask depicting the virus and carrying a mace made to look like the dreaded contagion. As he moves around with his team, he talks to people and tries to sensitise them about the disease, mainly through catchy slogans and one-liners.

For instance, one of the slogans attributed to Corona Chacha goes, “Mask pehno har din bhatije … warna honge corona positive natije (Wear mask, dear nephew, else you will test coronavirus positive).” 

Chauhan says he wanted to reach out to people in a manner that was effective which is why, he hit upon the idea of creating a character that dispenses one-liners that get people’s attention. “I participated in slogan writing competitions in college. When the pandemic hit our state, I decided to put that talent to good use,” he said with a smile, adding, “Research shows that the coronavirus is highly contagious and spreads easily. There is no vaccine to prevent it. Awareness is the only weapon we have but I believe many people are still not taking it seriously. So we decided to do our bit.”
