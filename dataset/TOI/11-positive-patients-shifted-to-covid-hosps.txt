Kolkata: Eleven patients who had tested positive for novel coronavirus at NRS Medical College and Hospital (NRSMCH) have been shifted to Covid-designated hospitals. The medicine ward and the gynaecology operating theatres where the patients were being treated have been sanitised.

The hospital authorities traced the healthcare workers involved in the treatment of the patients at the medicine ward. Some of their swab samples will be sent for confirmatory test. “We have shifted 10 patients to MR Bangur Hospital while one patient has been sent to ID&BG Hospital for further treatment,” said Saibal Mukherjee of NRSMCH. 

Out of the 11 patients, seven were admitted in the gynaecology ward while one was admitted in the male medicine ward. The rest of the patients were being treated in the Covid isolation ward. The gynaecology and medicine patients too were shifted to the isolation ward later after they had developed symptoms. They were shifted to the Covid hospitals after their test reports came.

“We have sanitized the whole gynaecology complex so that we can admit new patients. Such incident of patients turning positive is going to be part of the healthcare facilities for some time now. But we can’t stop treating other patents. We need to take precaution to minimise risks,” said Mukherjee.
