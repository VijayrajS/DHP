PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday stated that four patients have recovered, bringing down the number of known Covid-19 patients in the state to two. “We are happy to inform that samples of four patients were tested again as per protocol, and reported negative,” Rane said in a statement.

The health minister’s statement came after the medical bulletin, which didn’t specify that four had recovered.

Of seven Covid-19 cases detected in Goa, one was declared cured earlier this week and since then, the patient has been under monitored quarantine of 14 days.

“We are following all the guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and as per procedure, conducted all the necessary tests,” he said.

On Saturday, out of 25 samples pending for testing, 15 had tested negative and 10 reports were awaited. 120 persons were placed under home quarantine and seven suspects were being treated in the isolation ward of Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim. The number of persons in facility quarantine has gone down to 9, said a media bulletin from the directorate of health services (DHS).
