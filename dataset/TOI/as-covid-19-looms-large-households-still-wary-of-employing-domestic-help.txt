As Covid-19 looms large, households still wary of employing domestic help
2020-06-05
TRICHY: Although the lockdown has been eased with public transportation back on track, there is still hesitation among residents to allow their maids back into their houses. This has hit hard the livelihoods of maids as more than 50% of houses have refused to employ the maids back due to the Covid-19 scare.

According to unorganised sector sources, there are around 35,000 women employed as house maids in the city, hailing from slums and low-income group localities, as cooks and for domestic chores. 

After the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, gated communities and residents’ welfare associations banned the entry of maids into their compounds, even as most of the maids were employed in houses near their settlements. 

“I was employed in three houses before the lockdown, now only one has employed me back. Employers indirectly convey us that our services are not needed now,” said P Kannagi, a maid from Manjathidal.

Residents said that they are hesitat because the maids are employed in multiple houses.“As our employers are working from home, they have time to take care of the domestic chores. Some terminate us to bring down their monthly expenses,” said R Govindammal, a maid from Palakkarai. 

Even as gated communities have agreed to allow maids on the requests from senior citizens, a section of residents have opposed the move fearing Covid-19 spread. 

“We found out that the monthly income of maids has dipped somewhere between 50-70% post the lockdown. For essential commodities, maids still rely on NGOs,” said R Maruthanayagam, founder of Needs trust. The reluctance has made maids ponder about their future. As families have adapted to take care of their chores independently, maids said that their employers may permanently refrain from employing them.
