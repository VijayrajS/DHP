Tirupati: A Covid-19 testing laboratory was launched on Sunday at the Government General Hospital (GGH) in Kurnool. District collector G Veerapandian inspected the facility at the molecular biology lab at GGH. 

A trial run of the equipment was carried out in the presence of doctors and paramedic staff suring the inspection.

Speaking to reporters, the collector said, “In view of the spike in novel coronavirus cases in the district, we sent proposals to the state government to establish a Covid-19 testing lab at Kurnool GGH, and the state government readily approved the proposals. We procured new Covid-19 testing equipment from Chennai which has the capacity to process 100 samples and produce final test results within one hour. Everyday we can process nearly 1,300 samples to speed up screening in the district.”

“Because of the high number of positive cases reported in Kurnool district, all people in containment and high risk zones should voluntarily come forward to get themselves tested. with any symptoms of cold, cough, fever, should not hesitate to get themselves tested,” the collector appealed.

Later, the collector inspected lockdown enforcement measures at various places, including Raj Vihar, new and old bus stand areas, Bellary Junction and other places in the city.
