JABALPUR: Amid the scare over Coronavirus, families in the localities where the positive patients from Jabalpur reside are planning to shift to other places and rushing to hospitals in large numbers to get themselves screened. The four patients who were tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday are from two localities of the city.

Though the entire city was locked down by state government on Saturday, the scare over the virus has led to few families already shifting to other localities on Friday night itself.

“At present there are not male members in our family. So, we thought it would be appropriate to move with kids to the house of our relatives in another part of the city. We moved in the night itself,” said a woman, who had moved with her family from the locality where three of the patients were found to be positive.

Besides people shifting to other places, several residents from these two localities rushed to the hospitals in fear of Coronavirus and approached doctors to get themselves screened. However, as a majority of them had no symptoms, they were advised by doctors to take precautions and remain alert. Besides, 25 people who have come into the contact with the positive patients are being screened for Coronavirus, sources said.

Meanwhile, official sources said that condition of all the four patients who were tested positive for Coronavirus is stable. One of the patients had reached the hospital by driving his own car, said sources.
