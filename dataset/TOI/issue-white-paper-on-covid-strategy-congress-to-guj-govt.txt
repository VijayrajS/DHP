Issue white paper on Covid strategy: Congress to Gujarat govt
2020-06-10
GANDHINAGAR: With Covid-19 cases mounting to more than 21,000 in the state and the fatality count going past 1,300, the Gujarat Congress on Tuesday asked the BJP government to issue a white paper on its strategy to tackle the situation.

State Congress unit president Amit Chavda said people have been suffering because of the “failure” of the BJP, which has been in power in the state for 25 years. He pointed out that the Covid-19 mortality rate of Gujarat is the highest, at 6.26%, in the country.

Chavda questioned the steps taken by the state government to contain the virus spread and cited the warnings issued by the WHO as early as January this year. 

“Nearly 1,000 people have died in Ahmedabad where the BJP has been at the helm,” he said. “People are suffering because of the BJP’s inability to govern.”

Contrary to the claims made by the government on the availability of beds for patients, people are dying as they are being turned away by hospital authorities, Chavda said. “We demand that the government issue a white paper, stating the measures taken so far to control the pandemic and its plans,” Chavda added.

He suggested the creation of an online dashboard displaying real-time availability of beds in hospitals, especially in the worst-hit Ahmedabad. Chavda also accused the government of reducing the number of tests in a bid to “project a rosy picture” and alleged that an IAS officer who favoured more tests had been shunted out.
