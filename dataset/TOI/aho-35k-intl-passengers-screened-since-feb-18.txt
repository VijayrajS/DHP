HYDERABAD: The Airport Health Organisation (AHO) has screened 35,654 international passengers for coronavirus (Covid-19) since February 18 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport and referred seven suspected cases to Gandhi Hospital.

“We began screening passengers from 12 affected countries on February 18 and on March 3 we started universal screening of all international passengers,” AHO regional director Dr Anuradha Medoju told TOI.

“At Visakhapatnam Airport, the state health department is currently screening passengers as we do not have a team there. However, we are sharing all information regarding the standard operating procedures with the AP health department,” Dr Anuradha added.

She pointed out that no screening has been taken up at Vijayawada and Tirupati airports as there are no flights operating to the affected countries.

“Around 5,000-6,000 passengers are screened daily. Contacts of all suspected passengers have been kept under observation by the state health department,” Dr Anuradha said.

“We are on alert as new cases have been reported in Kerala. However, there are no new positive cases in Telangana,” director of state public health G Srinivasa Rao told TOI.
