Post-lockdown proving to be a harrowing time for cops in Surat
2020-06-14
Surat: The city police is facing a strange situation while dealing with criminals. Without knowing the medical status of the accused, the police have to arrest them. Cops also have to get their Covid-19 test done before producing the accused in court. During this process, the police personnel have to stay with them at least two days. During the lockdown, police arrested a large number of people for violation of order issued under public notification and negligent behaviour that could spread the infection. These accused were released on bail soon after arrest to reduce chances of infection to the cops. But in serious crimes like rioting, murder, kidnapping and rape, police have to arrest the accused and send them to judicial custody. Among those arrested during the over two-month lockdown, at least 13 accused out of 58 tested positive. . “It is a tricky situation for police to work in the post-lockdown period. As we don’t know who is infected and as part of duty we come in close contact with those arrested. As the restrictions in movement of people ends with the lockdown, there is the possibility of rise in crime and hence the risk is high for police,” city police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt told TOI. Till now total 30 policemen, homeguard, SRP and TRB jawans have been found positive in the city. Senior officials in the city police claim that the situation is better compared to Ahmedabad. To deal with the such situations, the police department is also taking various steps with which cops can stay safe. City police distributed 500 litres of sanitiser, 2.34 lakh masks, 2,500 faceshield, 57,000 pairs of gloves and 2,000 PPE kits to its staff. “The city police will continue taking various steps to ensure that our staff doesn’t get infected,” Bhrahmbhatt added.
