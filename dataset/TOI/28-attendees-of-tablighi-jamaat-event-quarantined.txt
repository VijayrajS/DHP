MANGALURU: The Dakshina Kannada district administration has identified 41 residents from the district who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Nizamuddin in New Delhi. Out of them, 26 have been quarantined at a building opposite Yenepoya Hospital on the hospital premises, and four, including two not connected with the event, at ESI hospital, on Thursday. The rest are in quarantine facilities outside the district, and even outside the state.


Mangaluru City North MLA Dr Y Bharath Shetty said most of these people who attended the event at Nizamuddin Markaz are asymptomatic of Covid-19, but they have been quarantined as per standard operating procedure. Noting that most of these patients have passed the normal incubation period for the coronavirus, he said they are still being quarantined as an additional precautionary measure.
