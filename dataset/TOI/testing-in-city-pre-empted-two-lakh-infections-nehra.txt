Testing in Ahmedabad pre-empted two lakh infections: Vijay Nehra
2020-04-18
AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra said the proactive surveillance and aggressive testing by the AMC had prevented two lakh Covid-19 infections in the city.

On Friday morning, Nehra said there were 571 cases reported in Ahmedabad city. “Of these, 500 tested positive after AMC field staff identifies them. If we assume one such case leads to 400 infections, the AMC’s through proactive surveillance and aggressive testing has saved nearly two lakh people from getting infected.”

Nehra added that as the Covid-19 mortality rate is over three percent, it could be extrapolated that active surveillance has saved 5,000 lives in the city. 

The commissioner said that on Thursday field teams collected 1,898 samples, the highest daily number so far.

He said that the AMC has so far tested 10,676 cases of which 1,400 were passive testing and 9,276 were active surveillance. He claimed the AMC’s strategy was more aggressive than even European countries. We are calling the AMC strategy of proactive surveillance and aggressive testing “Chasing the Virus”.

“We are confident that the AMC will definitely defeat the virus with the support of the people,” he said. Some 742 teams of the AMC surveyed 1.05 lakh houses and carried out health check-ups on 4.48 lakh people.
