Selfie contest to rev up lockdown days
2020-03-30
Coimbatore: The city corporation has announced a selfie contest for the residents to encourage them to stay at home during the lockdown. 

The city corporation, through its Twitter and Instagram handles, has asked the public to post their selfie that was taken while doing some fun activities at home and challenge five others, by tagging them. 

A civic body source said, “The purpose of the contest is to imbibe the thought of social distancing in the minds of people and encourage them to continue to stay at home. As most of the residents are used to going out on regular basis, it will be very hard for them to break their daily schedule. So, we have taken this initiative to keep them occupied.” 

Pointing out that their main focus was now on disinfecting public places, the source said they were also concerned about the people who were spending their time alone at home. 

While the initiative hasn’t found much takers, the source said they have been thinking of ways to make it popular among the residents.
