2020-05-24
NASHIK: For the second time, Nashik’s Covid-19 laboratory at the Dr Vasantrao Medical College Hospital and Research Centre has stopped functioning due to the lack of consumables.

The laboratory can process 180 swab samples per day. However, it has stopped functioning since Friday night as the plastic consumables required for testing have exhausted.

“The laboratory had placed the order for consumables from the manufacturer, but due to flight delay, there is a delay in supply and the lab has not yet received their order,” Collector Suraj Mandhare said.
