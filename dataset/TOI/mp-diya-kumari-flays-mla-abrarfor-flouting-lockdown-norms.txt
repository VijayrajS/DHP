JAIPUR: Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari has strongly condemned Sawai Madhopur MLA Danish Abrar for entering the Ranthambore National Park during lockdown, not following social distancing norms and not wearing mask in public place.

She said the video clip circulating on social media clearly shows that the behaviour of the MLA is highly irresponsible. The state government should take disciplinary action against its MLA.

Kumari alleged that Abrar had entered the publicly banned Ranthambore National Park along with private bouncers and activists. He flagrantly disregarded the guidelines and said was not bothered of the government. His actions can increase the risk of infection in tigers as well as employees.

Refuting the allegations, Abrar said, “I did not enter the tiger reserve. After receiving a complaint of corruption in constuction of a protection wall, I went for inspection after informing the DFO, Mukesk Saini.” As Kumari is the member of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) from Rajasthan, the Congress MLA had requested her to join the fight against corrupt officials at RNP.
