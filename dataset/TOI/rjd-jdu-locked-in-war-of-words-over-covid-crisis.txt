RJD, JD(U) locked in war of words over Covid crisis
2020-06-09
PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Monday launched a scathing attack on the state government over its handling of Covid-19 pandemic. While Lalu accused chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar of not leaving his house in this hour of crisis, Tejashwi alleged that testing for Covid-19 was abysmally low in the state.

The ruling JD(U), however, said the Bihar government has handled the pandemic much better than many other states.

“In Bihar, the number of coronavirus cases is increasing with each passing day. Doubling rate has also increased, but testing rate is very low. In a state with 12.60 crore population, less than one lakh tests have so far been done. The CM should explain the reason behind low rate of testing,” Tejashwi said.

The younger Yadav scion also questioned the CM’s “silence” on status of health infrastructure in the state. “It is baffling that the CM is mum on the number of ventilators and ICU beds available in the state,” he said.

Lalu, on the other hand, slammed Nitish for not coming out of his house and leaving the public in the middle of the battlefield. The incarcerated RJD chief tweeted that people will take count of all these in the upcoming state assembly elections.

Hitting back at Lalu, JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said the CM has handled the Covid-19 crisis in very efficiently. “Money was transferred into the bank accounts of lakhs of migrant workers. Similarly, lakhs of migrants were quarantined upon their return to the state. The government has also been devising ways to provide jobs to them. Tejashwi should visit his constituency to see the reality,” he said.

Another JD(U) state spokesperson, Anjum Ara, slammed Tejashwi for misleading people and giving wrong data. “Census was done in 2011 and fresh census is due next year. The population data cited by Tejashwi is unauthentic and misleading. He is already facing court trials in money laundering case. Hope he does not face another charge of misleading people by using false data. Also, the state government has spent over Rs 8,538 crore on managing Covid-19 crisis. Being an opposition leader, Tejashwi should know what the government is doing instead of telling lies to people,” Anjum added.
