“We have asked all government offices to minimize the use of air-conditioner units as per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and Government of India advisory,” said Tope at his daily press briefing on Saturday. He added the guidelines suggest offices must use fans and keep windows and doors open for ventilation “as a virus’ life increases in low temperature and decreases in sunlight”.

It is said a virus can live longer in low temperatures. “A virus can stay for seven to eight hours in low temperatures but only for an hour to two in normal temperatures,’’ said Tope. “It could stay alive in an AC duct for long and through air circulation infect others,” said the minister as an explanation for asking government offices to use fans.

ACs were considered the main culprit for the quick spread of Covid-19 on Hawaiian cruise liner Diamond Princess where thousands of passengers tested positive. 

Dr Shashank Joshi, dean of the Indian College of Physicians, said there has been a debate on whether higher temperatures can kill the virus. “The jury is still out there but there have been outbreaks in Australia and Singapore that have high temperatures,” said Dr Joshi.
