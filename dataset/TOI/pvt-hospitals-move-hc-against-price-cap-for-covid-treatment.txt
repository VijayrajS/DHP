Pvt hospitals move HC against price cap for Covid treatment
2020-05-28
Ahmedabad: The city’s designated Covid-19 private hospitals approached the Gujarat high court on Wednesday against the HC order to the government to rein them in by not allowing them to charge exorbitant rates and to place a cap on charges. They complained that any further squeezing by HC and government would lead to closure of private hospitals as they will fail to meet treatment costs.Besides the capping of rates for 50% private beds apart from the beds acquired by the government by the May 14 order by HC, the Ahmedabad Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) has also registered an objection to the high court’s May 22 suggestions to the authorities to reduce rates further for treatment of private patients. Sources said that the authorities have asked private hospitals to reduce their rates further by 30%.AHNA, a body of 246 private hospitals and nursing homes, has urged the HC to recall its orders to the authorities to cap the treatment rates in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients on beds other than the 50% acquired by the authorities. It is saying that the private hospitals are already treating 50% patients referred to them by AMC.Objecting to HC’s May 14 order, AHNA claims that allegations of charging exorbitant price in private hospitals are baseless.The petition contends that because of the cap andthe HC order for further cut in charges for private patients, there is immense pressure on private hospitals. “It is not possible to relent to such pressures as the reduction is not further possible as it is not financially viable and would result in compelling the hospitals to stop functioning for want of proper resources to run and manage the hospitals and nursing homes,” the petition reads.The petitioner has also objected to HC’s order of not charging advance deposit from private patients. “If this applies to private patients, it would create serious jeopardy and it would not be possible to bear the burden of such action. It would not be conducive and not feasible for private hospitals to provide treatment,” the petition claims.AHNA has said that private hospitals were never asked before fixing these rates and taking decisions. Hence, it should also be heard. The HC is likely to hear this petition with its suo motu PIL on Friday.
