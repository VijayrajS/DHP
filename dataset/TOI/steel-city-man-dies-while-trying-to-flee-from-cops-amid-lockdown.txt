JAMSHEDPUR: An elderly man died after he suffered a cardiac arrest while trying to escape from the police amid the lockdown in Jamshedpur’s Mango locality on Tuesday night. This is the third lockdown-related death in a month in Steel City, which is a green zone without a single Covid-19 case. 


Jharkhand is continuing with a complete lockdown across the state until May 17 as chief minister Hemant Soren has not given any relaxation in any part of the state even though 11 of 24 districts have not reported a single Covid-19 case.

Mohamed Akil (50), an apparel store owner, was at his shop, which he had opened earlier in the evening, when the police reached the area around 10pm. He quickly downed the shutters at his shop and tried to escape, but collapsed while he was on the run. Locals took him to Tata Main Hospital (TMH) after he complained of uneasiness, but he died before the doctors could attend to him. 

Mango police station in-charge Mithilesh Kumar said, “A police van was on patrolling duty when the Akil saw us and tried to flee even though the team did not initiate any action against him. As he ran into a narrow lane, the cops left the spot. We only learnt later that he died while attempting to escape. His family has not lodged any complaint, but his son Mohamed Gulab has claimed his father died after the police chased him. Akil’s last rites were held on Wednesday morning. A post-mortem was not required in this case as the cause of death is beyond suspicion.” Kumar said. 

In a similar incident on April 6, Vicky Mahato (26) jumped in the lake and drowned while running away from the police in the city’s Birsanagar police station area on April 6. On April 4, Lakhinder Behra (34), died after his neighbour pushed him down from the second floor of his residential building. They had got into an altercation as Behra dumped garbage in the building as he could not got out amid the lockdown.
