Cuttack: A man from Kandhamal district, who had voluntarily admitted himself to a local hospital after developing symptoms similar to those being displayed by coronavirus patients, was admitted and kept in isolation in Cuttack’s SCB Medical College and Hospital on Saturday.

Mrutunjay Muni, 26, a resident of Phulbani who had returned home from China on January 12, was admitted to the state’s premier medical college hospital at 3.20 am. He has been kept in the isolation wing and will be monitored by a nine-member team of experts.

“Muni has been kept under observation in the special ward’s isolation wing for suspected coronavirus infection,” said M R Patnaik, head of the department of pulmonary medicine, who is also the nodal officer of the treatment committee. “The patient’s vital organs have been examined. His condition is stable,” Patnaik added. “His blood and swab samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune,” he further said.

Besides Patnaik, the treatment committee comprises the heads of the departments of medicine, microbiology, ENT, community medicine and anaesthesiology. The 42-bed special epidemic ward set up for the treatment of coronavirus patients comprises the isolation wing, which has 11 beds, and an ICU with eight beds. The remaining 23 beds are for positive cases.

Muni, a medical student of Southwest Medical University in the Sichuan province of China, was referred to SCB from the district headquarters hospital in Phulbani, where he had got himself admitted after developing flu-like symptoms. “After returning from China, I started feeling feverish. I also had cough and cold. Given that coronavirus is spreading in China and my symptoms matched that of the deadly disease, I voluntarily went for a health check-up at the district headquarters hospital in Phulbani,” Muni had told TOI earlier.
