The family members took the body to Ramanathapuram in an ambulance. They reached Keezhakarai the next day. His body was buried at a mosque around 10am on Friday. 

Inquiries revealed that around 50 members had attended the last rites. “In all the deaths so far, hospital authorities and district officials ensured that there were not more than three or four people near the body. We do not allow them to open the bag. They can just see the face of the deceased,” said director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. “We are told that they had not opened the body in Ramanathapuram too, but we are verifying it,” he said.
