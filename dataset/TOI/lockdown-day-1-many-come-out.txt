Lockdown Day 1: Many come out
2020-03-25
Bareilly: With the state government extending the lockdown across 17 districts to stem the coronavirus from spreading, residents’ response to self-imposed isolation was lukewarm in the city on the very first day, on Monday. The lockdown will be in place till March 25.

A day after janata curfew, local residents seemed to have thrown caution into the winds. Social distancing is vital to prevent the virus from spreading and that is why the lockdown was necessary. However, people came out of their houses either to buy essential commodities or simply to loiter about on the roads.

A large number of private vehicles were seen plying in Civil Lines, Qutubkhana, Bara Bazaar, Ayub Khan Crossing, Circuit House Road and others.

Police personnel deputed on roads were seen struggling to intercept the vehicles and asking the drivers to go back home, warning them of action if they ventured out unnecessarily.

Shailesh Kumar Pandey, Bareilly SSP, said, “Even as the lockdown period has been extended, many local residents were spotted on city roads on Monday. People, especially two-wheeler riders, started venturing out since 11 am as a few shops like grocery stores, ration shops, medical stores, petrol pumps, etc, were opened for a short period after the almost 24-hour janata curfew. Maximum people were spotted in the Civil Lines area in the afternoon where general stores and shops etc were opened. Besides, the vegetable market in Qutubkhana also witnessed significant footfall as people came out to purchase vegetables and fruits.” 

Police officers said guidelines had been issued by state government to local administration to ensure proper implementation of the lockdown in respective districts and initiate relevant action in case of non-compliance.

UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, announced lockdown across 16 Uttar Pradesh districts till March 25.
