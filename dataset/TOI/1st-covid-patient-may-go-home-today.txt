Thrissur: India’s first patient who was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is likely to be discharged on Thursday after two consecutive tests of the samples taken from her turned out to be negative.

A decision on discharging her from the medical college hospital here would be made on Thursday after one more test by the experts from the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Sources at the hospital termed her condition stable and the woman was likely to be discharged on Thursday.

A medical board constituted to supervise the patient and suspected cases would meet on Thursday to take a call on the patient.

The patient, a medical student in China’s Wuhan—the epicentre of Covid-19—had tested positive for the virus on January 30, and has since been undergoing treatment at the hospital.

Two others, who were also diagnosed with Covid-19 in Alappuzha and Kasaragod districts, were discharged earlier. The patient in Thrissur was the first to be diagnosed with the deadly virus.

The man in Alappuzha who had tested positive for Covid on February 1 was discharged 12 days later, and the Kasaragod man was sent home on Sunday. He had tested positive on February 3.

All three had travelled together to Kerala from China.

According to medical protocol, a patient should test negative for the virus twice before being announced clear of the infection.

Health department officials, meanwhile, said two persons were now under hospital-based surveillance for Covid-19 in the district, besides 174 others in home quarantine.

No fresh samples were sent for tests from the district on Wednesday, sources said.
