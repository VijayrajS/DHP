Vadodara: Despite not a single positive case of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, capacity at both private and public hospitals is being enhanced as part of precautionary measure to combat COVID-19.The state-run SSG Hospital which was the first one to set up an isolation ward now has capacity to admit 24 patients. At the GMERS Gotri Hospital, the capacity of isolation ward was ten which is being scaled up to 15.“At the two major government hospitals, currently 39 beds facility has been created,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal, who also held a meeting with representatives of private hospitals.Six private hospitals have also set up isolation wards that can accommodate 32 patients. These include Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Sterling Hospital, Tricolours Hospital, Shukun Hospital, Bankers Hospital and Savita Hospital. “Both government and private hospitals presently have 71 bed capacity. We have asked the private hospitals to enhance their capacity further. SSG Hospital too is equipped to increase its capacity,” said Agrawal.The State Institute of Health and Family Welfare has created quarantine facility for 71 persons at Ajwa Road as part of precautionary measure.Sources said that this facility has been set up so as to accommodate those who test positive and need not require intensive care at SSG or other private hospitals.“In the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) areas, 351 persons have been screened. Samples of seven of them were collected and all of them have tested negative,” she said.“In VMC areas too quarantine and observation facilities are being created. The staff at community health centre and public health centres, ASHA workers, community health officers, anganwadi workers have already been sensitised while doctors of private hospitals are being trained,” she said.BOX: 18 stores penalised for overpricing masksVadodara: The district administration has penalised 18 stores for selling masks at exorbitant prices. The stores had to pay Rs 30,000 as penalty for overcharging masks.“The government has already put masks and hand sanitisers under Essential Commodities Act (ECA) to ensure proper availability of these items in market at correct price and our teams are constantly keeping a check on pricing,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal.She, however, appealed citizens to wash their hands properly and frequently with soap instead of relying on hand sanitisers as the former is a better hygiene practice.
