TRICHY: A 27-year-old man who arrived at the international airport here from Singapore in the early hours of Sunday was admitted to an isolation ward in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) here on suspicion of being infected with coronavirus. However, doctors who checked him said he was suffering from common flu and not the novel coronavirus infection which has wreaked havoc in China and other countries. 


A native of Kottampatti in Madurai, he is working as a driver in Singapore. "During medical examination, it came to light that he had no symptoms of coronavirus but fever and cold. He had no breathing difficulties and his condition is stable," MGMGH dean K Vanithamani said. 

The man, who is working as a driver in Singapore, arrived by a Scoot Air flight to attend his sister's marriage scheduled for February 6. He underwent screening at a special desk at the airport on arrival at 12.35am. As the man was found having high fever and cold, he was taken to MGMGH and admitted to the isolation ward around 2.50am.

 He was administered paracetamol and adequate hydration liquid, Vanithamani said. According to the government protocol, he would be under medical supervision at the isolation ward at least for two weeks. 

"Based on his progress, the throat swab test will be conducted in Pune. However, since he is infected with common flu, that situation may not arise", the dean added.
