Nagpur: Pharm D graduates in Maharashtra are eager to join the medical workforce of state in fight against Covid-19. They are right now not allowed to treat patients in state.

“Pharm D holders are experts in modern medicines. As frontline health providers, we are highly trusted and trained healthcare professionals. We can play critical role in patient care and public health,” said Dr Vinayak Bhagwat Ghayal, president of Doctor of Pharmacy Association, Maharashtra.

In fact, the state health department has started temporary recruitments of doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff to deal with Covid-19 pandemic. Graduates of AYUSH faculties are allowed to apply for posts of health officers at PHCs. But, Pharm D holders are not mentioned in it. 

Doctor of Pharmacy course is a practice oriented programme after 10+2 which includes five years of academic study and 1 year of internship or residency in hospitals. Those who clear this course are entitled to use “Dr” prefix.
