VADODARA: A man from Santrampur town of Mahisagar district died in Kuwait after getting infected with novel coronavirus.


The victim Vinay Chauhan and his brother Rajesh had gone for employment to Kuwait a few years back. Family sources said that they used to work there as tailors. 

The family lives in Patel Falia locality in Santrampur.

Vinay had taken ill about a week back and had even seen a doctor. When his condition did not improve despite medication, a test to ascertain if he was suffering from COVID-19 was conducted. 

"He tested positive and admitted in a hospital. Rajesh also tested, but his reports were negative and he was discharged from the hospital," said Kanchan Chauhan, Vinay and Rajesh's sister.

Kanchan, who also stays in Santrampur, said that the family was informed about Vinay's death at around 1.30am on Saturday. She said that Vinay's last rites will be performed in Kuwait itself. Rajesh too will not be able to return home to be with the grieving family due to the lockdown and suspension of flights.

Vinay is survived by his wife and two children who live in Santrampur with his parents. His father Devchand is in shock after learning about the death and was advised rest.

Kuwait has reported nearly 479 cases of Covid-19.
