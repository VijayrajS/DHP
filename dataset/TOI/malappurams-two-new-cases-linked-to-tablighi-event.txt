Malappuram: Two persons in the district, who attended Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin, tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday.

This brings the total number of positive cases reported in the district to 13.

District collector said that both 63-year-old man from Kooriyad in Vengara and 33-year-old man from Bypass Road in Chemmad were part of a same group that attended the conference on March 11 and 12.

The 14-member team left Malappuram on February 14. They boarded Amritsar Express train to Nizamuddin from Kozhikode railway station on February 5. They returned to Kozhikode on March 15. Health authorities have said that they had visited markets in Chemmad and mosques.

Meanwhile, giving special focus on the preventive measures to check spread of Covid-19 in Keezhattur and surrounding areas in the district, the district administration has opened a Covid Special Care Centre at Keezhattur.

Extensive travel of a 45-year-old spiritual healer at Poonthanam near Keezhattur who returned recently from Jeddah after Umrah pilgrimage, had triggered panic among people in the region after his 85-year-old father was tested positive for coronavirus infection. The 85-year-old man will be shifted to new Covid Care Centre in Keezhattur soon.

Authorities have already collected swab samples from 76 persons, including the samples from wife and children of the spiritual healer, in the region for testing. District medical officer K Sakeena said that the 15 samples collected from Keezhattur region tested negative. Stringent prevention activities would also be taken in Vettathur, Melattur and Anakkayam regions.
