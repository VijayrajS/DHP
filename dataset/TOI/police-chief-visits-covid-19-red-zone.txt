VIJAYAWADA: Vijayawada police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao inspected Old Rajarajeswaripet area which is deemed ‘red zone’ in the city with several number of Covid-19 cases on Friday.


Addressing the media, Tirumala Rao said there were 25 coronavirus positive cases in the city. These cases have been reported in Vidhyadharapuram, Old Rajarajeswaripet, Ranigarithota, Khuddus Nagar, Payakapuram and Sanat Nagar, which were declared as red zones.

“The district collector and the municipal commissioner are providing all the essential supplies to the residents’ doorstep especially, in the red zones. We urge the public to not step out of their homes,” Tirumala Rao said.

“As far as the red zoned areas are concerned, there are special committees set up with the local sub-inspector and revenue officials being involved. Prior permissions have to be taken if there is a large distribution of these essential commodities being planned. If prior permissions aren’t taken then action would be taken against them,” Rao said.
