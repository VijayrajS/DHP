The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (MIM) had made a similar demand a few days ago. The term of existing civic body is scheduled to come to an end on April 27.

Talking to the media on Wednesday, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele of the Shiv Sena said the poll panel must defer the election by at least six months. 

“The patients with coronavirus have been detected in Maharashtra. Although Aurangabad has not reported any case of the disease so far, it will be wise to put off the polls for the civic body by at least six month,” he said.

Ghodele said the health authorities have issued an advisory asking citizens to avoid mass gatherings. “The election process involves holding rallies and public meetings, involving a large number of people. Therefore, we demand postponement of AMC election till the coronavirus is contained in the country,” the mayor said.

The mayor said he would contact chief minister Udhhav Thackeray with their plea of deferring AMC polls. 

Earlier, MIM MP of Aurangabad Imtiyaz Jaleel had demanded that AMC polls be postponed. “Rallies of different political parties are inevitable during election and therefore it is desirable to put off election,” Jaleel had said on March 9.

The Aurangabad municipal corporation came into existence on December 8,1982. Among its 115 members, 29 are from Shiv Sena, MIM (24), BJP (23), Congress (11), BSP (5), NCP (4) and RPI (2) along with 17 independents. The civic body has five co-opted members.
