CHENNAI: Three more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu on Saturday, taking the total number of cases to six, state health minister C Vijayabaskar said. While two of them are Thai nationals, the third, a 65-year-old man, had returned from New Zealand, he said.


The three new cases sent the state Covid-19 control room into a tizzy, as authorities placed healthcare workers exposed to the positive patients under quarantine. With regard to the two Thai nationals, health workers had to scan the passenger list of a Delhi-Erode train looking for their co-passengers and to identify people who had come into contact with them during their stay in Erode mosques. Authorities have asked the mosque managers to restrict entry and undertake disinfectant protocol.
