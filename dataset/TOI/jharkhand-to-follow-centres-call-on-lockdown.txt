Jharkhand to follow Centre’s call on lockdown
2020-04-14
RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Monday said the state will follow whatever the Centre decides on the lockdown. Coming out of the cabinet meeting, Hemant said it was a collective decision of the state and he is waiting for the Centre to come up with a decision. “During the cabinet meeting, our colleagues also suggested that the lockdown should be extended, but we are also concerned about the challenges of the lockdown and any reopening,” he said. Soren said essential services have already been kept out of the purview of lockdown but they have still been derailed. “Our focus is to restore normalcy in the sectors that are exempted from the lockdown. Recently, we have procuring milk from farmers to convert it to powdered milk so that the produce is not wasted and the farmers get some financial relief,” he said.
