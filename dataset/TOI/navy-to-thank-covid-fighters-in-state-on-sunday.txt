Panaji: In line with the call given by the Union ministry of defence, Indian Navy helicopters will conduct a flypast over Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, and ESI Hospital, Margao, on Sunday morning. Naval helicopters will shower flower petals on the two hospitals, which serve as dedicated medical facilities to tackle Covid-19 in Goa.

The flypast will be conducted at around 10am, with the choppers taking off from the naval airbase INS Hansa. The initiative of the armed forces is a gesture to thank doctors, nurses and healthcare workers. Nationally, the Indian Air Force will conduct a flypast from Srinagar to Trivandrum and another starting from Dibrugarh in Assam to Kutch in Gujarat.
