Ranchi: In order to boost the number of Covid-19 tests in Jharkhand, the state health department on Friday authorised Medica hospital, Ranchi to collect swab and blood samples and send them for RT-PCR tests to their Kolkata lab. The approval comes five days after the private hospital received ICMR’s approval for testing Covid-19 samples at its Kolkata facility.

Talking to TOI, MD, National Health Mission (NHM) Shailesh Chourasia said, “We received a proposal from Medica Hospital, Ranchi, for collection and testing of Covid-19 samples in Jharkhand based on their approval from ICMR to their lab in Kolkata. After examining the proposal and their certification issued by ICMR, we have provided an approval to start testing at their Kolkata lab and have directed them to follow safety protocols during the collection and testing of samples as per the guidelines issued by ICMR.”

The Medica hospital group will facilitate the collection of samples through their state-of-the-art diagnostic centre in the city and provide the test results within 48 hours of sample collection. The hospital chain has also been directed to share the details of collection and test results on a daily basis to the state IDSP authorities without fail and not charge more than Rs 4,500 per test which has been fixed by state government.

With Medica hospitals getting the approval, the number of private entities conducting sample testing in the state rose to six as Dr Lal Path Labs, SRL limited, Core diagnostics and Path Kind diagnostics were allowed by the state health department on May1. Tata Main Hospital has also been authorised to test Covid-19 samples in Jamshedpur.

On being inquired about the commencement of their operations, assistant vice president (operations), Medica group of hospitals, Anil Kumar said, “Soon after we received the approval for testing Covid-19 samples on May 10 for our Kolkata lab, we approached the state government with our proposal. We will be collecting samples from individuals and send them for testing to our Kolkata lab the same day so that we can provide the results within 48 hours as per the directions of ICMR.”
