MADURAI: The 25-year-old elder son of the man from Anna Nagar in Madurai who recently died of Covid-19 has also tested positive for the virus, in addition to the victim’s wife and younger son. 


He, along with his mother and brother are undergoing treatment at the isolation ward at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) and their condition is stable. The son tested positive for Covid-19 only during his second test. In the initial test, the results were negative, but a re-test was done after his mother and brother tested positive. “The victim’s daughter-in-law and 1.5-year-old grandson tested negative. Two cooks who worked with the family were also tested negative as well,” district collector Dr T G Vinay told TOI.

Meanwhile, the Virudhunagar district collector has said that the 60-year-old man from Rajapalayam who tested positive for Covid-19 may have contracted the infection from three foreign guests who attended his son’s wedding in Madurai on March 5. “Among the 1,500 people who attended the wedding were three foreign guests from The Netherlands, United States and Germany. Later, they had returned to their own countries. It could be the source of infection,” he said.

In Sivaganga district, at least 26 people were identified to have attended a conference organised by the Thowheed Jamaath, an Islamic organisation, in New Delhi where Thai nationals, who tested positive for Covid-19 were present. Among them, four were admitted to the isolation ward at Sivaganga Medical College Hospital.
