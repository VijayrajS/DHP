2020-06-12
SECUNDERABAD: As part of the special drive on commercial establishments to check Covid-19 preventive measures, a special team of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) on Thursday conducted raids on 10 to 15 shops in Marredpally and penalised them.


The first Covid-19 case had been identified in Marredpally and till date four positive cases have been reported in the area. 

The SCB officials found that all the managements had thrown the Covid-19 norms out of the window. “We observed that they are not maintaining physical distancing norms, thermal scanners and providing sanitizers,” a SCB sanitation wing official, who led the special team, told TOI.

Two major commercial units were sealed and penalties were imposed on the remaining commercial units. “We also warned the shopkeepers, who were penalised, that their shops will be sealed if further violations are found,” he added. 

Till date, SCB has raided 30 to 50 commercial units and penalised more than 25 shops. 

Meanwhile, a new positive case has surfaced in Bowenpally on Thursday.
