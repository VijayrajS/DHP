PRAYAGRAJ: As the threat posed by novel coronavirus (Covid-19) looms large, concern over a potential outbreak failed to deter Prayagraj residents from thronging markets on Sunday for some last-minute shopping for Holi.

Popular markets like Chowk, Civil Lines, Katra, Bahadurganj, Mutthiganj and Sulemsarai wore a crowded look on Sunday as shoppers came out in large numbers. 

Be it sweet shops selling ghujiyas or those offering gulal and herbal colours, there was hardly a shop without a crowd of customers . 

Most shoppers said they were not bothered by the advisories issued by the government urging residents to avoid public gatherings due to the spread of novel coronavirus. The footfall in these markets only swelled by afternoon. 

“My family and friends have decided to play Holi using natural colours as there is no threat of coronavirous in the city. Reports from other parts of the world might have dimmed the excitement, but there is nothing stopping us from playing Holi,” said a shopper in Civil Lines Vinayak Mehrotra.

Dhoomanganj resident Alok Srivastava said “People are not avoiding buying Holi supplies and colours that are for sale. I would be celebrating Holi with my friends and neighbours as well.”

Garima, who came to Civil Lines for shopping, said, “Why shouldn’t we celebrate Holi? The festival is celebrated is just once a year. If we take precautions, no harm will be done.” 

Meanwhile, health department officials on Sunday claimed that no coronavirus cases have been reported in the city till now and they are trying to make more and more people aware about precautionary measures.
