2020-04-09
HYDERABAD: The Telangana municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) department on Wednesday issued additional guidelines on safe management of bodies of suspected and confirmed coronavirus cases. 


Giving bath to the body, which is a tradition in many religions, has been prohibited. Touching or hugging the body is also not allowed. Family members (not more than three persons) are permitted to see the body in the hospital at any point of time through a protected glass window, however, they are not allowed to enter the mortuary or come in contact with the deceased. 

During the transit from the hospital to the graveyard, no family members or relatives shall be allowed in the vehicle carrying the body of the coronavirus victim. 

The number of family members, who wish to attend the last rites at the graveyard, are restricted to only five and they shall reach through their own transport along with safety gear. 

The government on Wednesday also expressed the need for having a designated burial ground for the disposal of coronavirus victims. The body of the victim will be transported in a dedicated ambulance to coronavirus cases to the graveyard by a group of four body handlers. In case of non-availability of a site at their regular burial site, the municipal authorities shall dispose the body as per the availability of sites. 

The body shall be covered in a plastic sheet ensuring that the face is visible. The body will be placed in a leak-proof zip bag which must have a transparent section for viewing the face of the deceased.
