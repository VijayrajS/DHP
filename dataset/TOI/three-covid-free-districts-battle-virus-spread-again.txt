Rajkot: The worst fears of authorities in districts of Saurashtra are coming true. Three districts, which had recently become Covid-free, are again battling the spread of virus, now due to influx of outsiders.

On Friday, 14 including at least seven women who had come to Jamnagar from Ahmedabad tested positive for Covid-19. An 11-month-old boy, whose parents are from Kharva village of Dhrol, but returned from Ahmedabad, died at GG Hospital. The baby was admitted on Wednesday, but tested positive after death on Friday evening. Earlier, parents had refused to accept the body until the hospital tests their son for Covid, said official sources.

Similarly, a 35-year-old man who came with a valid pass from Ahmedabad to Kodinar town of Gir-Somnath was also found infected.

According to district officials, three women - aged 52 years, 20 years and 42 years - were caught by police entering Jamjodhpur town illegally. They all were coming from Ahmedabad and sent to government quarantine facility. A 27-year-old woman of Amardi Mevasa village near Jamjodhpur was also caught entering illegally in the district. Three other women had entered Jamnagar city with valid passes.

In Kodinar, the 35 year old man tested positive on Thursday night and was kept in government quarantine facility. 

In Kutch, which had become Covid-free recently, a 22-year-old lady doctor, who came to Bhuj from Mumbai, tested positive on Friday. She had returned to Bhuj on May 5 with valid documents. 

She has now been shifted to the civil hospital. Earlier, seven out of the eight patients, had recovered while one had died.
