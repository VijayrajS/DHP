Tablighi Jamaat popular among rural and urban poor
2020-04-02
Belagavi: It’s now becoming clear that many Tablighi Jamaat attendees were from North Karnataka where the sect has penetrated deep into rural pockets.

In Belagavi alone, 62 people were traced, with 32 and 36 persons from Bidar and Kalaburagi respectively. The initial hunt in other parts suggest that 15 people are from Dharwad, 12 from Ballari, 8 from Koppal and 5 from Yadgir. So far, 160 people had confirmed connections with the Nizamuddin Markaz.

The popularity of this community among the rural poor driven by extensive spread in Muslim majority areas is believed to be the key reason for large participation. 

Kalaburagi-based Asghar Chulbul, member, All India Mill Council and special invitee at All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said “Tablighi, a sub-sect of larger Sunni Islam, has a large following among economically backward or working class.”

He said preachers of the communitytake their version of Islam to every household. “Preachers and their wives travel from to door to door, mosques to mosques. They carry literature about their beliefs to introduce explain nuances of the religion.” 

Asghar said nearly 54% of Karnataka Muslims are in North Karnataka and the majority is poor. Tablighi is a harmless community and thanks to their strong outreach, poor people in the region give their unstinted allegiance. Many people from North Karnataka attended the Delhi event.

Dr Maqsood Chanda, a medical practitioner working with the district administration in the fight against Covid, said proximity to Hyderabad and Latur makes the community popular. Hyderabad-Karnataka was once ruled by the Nizam and the Tablighi Jamaat has been working here since its inception. The sect is popular community both in Hyderabad-Karnataka and Mumbai-Karnataka. 

Chanda said “Many people who have not undergone any formal education believe in this sect. This is also the reason for large-scale participation.”
