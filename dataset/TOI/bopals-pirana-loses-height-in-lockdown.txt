Ahmedabad: ‘Bopal’s Pirana’ loses height in lockdown
2020-05-17
AHMEDABAD: The lockdown may have seen a reduction in daily waste collection in Ahmedabad city, but the Bopal-Ghuma nagarpalika grabbed the opportunity to reduce the height of its own garbage dump, popularly known as ‘Bopal’s Pirana’, near the Delhi Public School.

Jigisha Shah, the president of Bopal-Ghuma nagarpalika said, “One will find a visible difference in the dump site as the height has been reduced considerably. Taking advantage of the lockdown, we ensured that the heap was levelled using earthmover vehicles (JCBs) and trucks.” The Bopal-Ghuma nagarpalika has been processing the garbage daily for the last three months using trommel machines like the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. 

Shah said that in the next two-three months the garbage dump, which was a eyesore for passersby, will see further improvement.

The Bopal dump site had nearly 50,000 tonnes of garbage and had a height of 8 ft which has currently been cut down to 4 ft. Nearly 200 to 250 tonnes of garbage is generated daily in the nagarpalika.

Sources said there has been a 20% reduction in collected garbage during the lockdown. The nagarpalika does not receive construction or garden waste at the dump, but only kitchen and other waste.

Hemant Patel, chief officer of the nagarpalika said that the trommel machine had stopped work since the lockdown, and taking this opportunity the nagarpalika levelled the heap in the area. “We have asked the contractor to process 300 tonnes of garbage daily,” he said.

“We are expecting the site to be totally free of garbage by the end of November this year,” said a senior member of the nagarpalika. He said that garbage had been overflowing onto the road making it difficult to drive. But now it is far from the main road and the area looks better.
