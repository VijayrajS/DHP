Kin plead to rescue MBBS students stranded in Wuhan
2020-01-26
Among the several Indian students stranded at Wuhan city in China due to the coronavirus are Manisankar and Robin Raj of Tamil Nadu, both final year MBBS students there. A worried Paneerselvam, Manisankar’s father, said the Indian government is yet to wake up to the severity of the problem.


“It has been a week since my son Manisankar is stuck in Wuhan. The fact remains that he is not infected with coronavirus. But there has not been any effort from the Indian government to bring him back,” rues the 55-year-old man from Pudukottai district. A house surgeon in one of the hospitals, Manisankar, 22, is on the verge of completing his five-year MBBS course in Wuhan University. “Confined within the four walls over the last one week, they don’t even have food for the next two days and fear to move out due to the outbreak,” said Paneerselvam who is in touch with his son over phone. 

On Friday, Paneerselvam approached collector P Uma Maheswari and gave a petition seeking help to get his son back along with his fellow classmate Robin Raj of Nagapatinnam. The collector has forwarded the letter to the ministry of external affairs and the Indian embassy in China for necessary steps. Paneerselvam says his son received a call from the Indian embassy on Friday but there has not been any steps since then. Delaying the rescue of his son as well as the other Indian students will make them vulnerable to infection, says he.

Manisankar is staying outside the university along with Robin Raj. He had come to his native place at Anthanur village in Gandharvakottai in September last year to attend a family function. He returned and chose not to come again during his scheduled vacation from December 16 to January 3.
