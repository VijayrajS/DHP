“Based on orders from the state government, home theatre, health club and swimming pool at the club will remain shut from March 16-29. Your cooperation is solicited,” read a message issued by Karnavati Club management.

Similarly, Gujarat Sports Club has also intimated members about the development in the wake of advisory. “We have shut down the swimming pool and two in-house theatres for screening of movies in the club. Since there is no guideline to shut down the gym, we will keep it open and make sanitisers available and take all hygiene precautions. At the same time, we will also consult all the state health authorities and take appropriate steps,” said an official.

Rajpath Club called off a Club Housie scheduled on Sunday. “We told members in advance that the housie has been cancelled. No other events will take place at the club and the gym, swimming pools and theatres will be shut. Members can visit the club for other activities,” said Mishal Patel, secretary, Rajpath Club.
