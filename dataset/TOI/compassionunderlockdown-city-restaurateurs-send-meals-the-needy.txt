#Compassionunderlockdown: City restaurateurs send meals the needy
2020-04-11
While most Bengalureans have ensured that the poorer sections of society are taken care of during the lockdown and are either cooking for them, or sending out groceries, the city’s restaurateurs have now stepped into the fray. The goal is to ensure that the needy and those working on the frontline, do not go without food.

Catering to the needy
“We are trying to serve 10,000 meals a day directly to the affected areas of Bengaluru, where people don’t have access to basic necessities that most of us,” wrote restaurateur Nikhil Hegde in a social media post, adding that with every share of the post, they would give 10 meals to those in need.

A salute to the policemen
Restaurateur Karthik Reddy is ensuring that the policemen on duty get fresh, hot meals daily, through the ‘Stars salute the cops’ initiative, for which he gets Sandalwood actors to distribute food prepared at his restaurant to cops on duty. "Our intention is to express our gratitude to the policemen who’ve been toiling day and night, sacrificing their well-being and not spending time with their own families through this pandemic,” he says.

Helping strays, too
Besides distributing food to around 200 people working as security and other essential staff daily, Nerall Bakhai’s restaurant has now taken up an additional responsibility. “We have opened up our kitchen to a team of volunteers who used to feed 100 dogs daily. They can now feed twice as many,” he shares.
