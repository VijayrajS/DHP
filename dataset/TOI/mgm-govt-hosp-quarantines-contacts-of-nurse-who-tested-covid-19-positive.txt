Trichy: After a 37-year-old staff nurse working at Mahatma Gandhi memorial (MGM) government hospital tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, the hospital administration has taken several precautionary measures including compulsory leave for her colleagues.

The hospital administration asked around 15 staffers including doctors, nurses and hospital workers to home quarantine themselves for six days starting Sunday and they should give their samples for testing on the sixth day. In case they test negative, they will be allowed to resume duty. If they test positive, they will be admitted to the isolation ward for treatment.

The nurse was on duty to take care of a Covid-19 positive pregnant woman. The hospital administration said the nurse might have contracted the disease from the positive patients. The husband of the nurse was also admitted to the hospital as he had few symptoms.

Meanwhile, some nurses expressed their inconvenience in wearing the personal protective equipment (PPE) kit during their duty in isolation wards at MGMGH. 

“We have been going through unbearable pain of excessive perspiration by putting on the PPE kit during our shift in the isolation ward. As we feel dehydrated, we tend to open the kit and drink water, risking our health,” said a nurse.

They should not open the kit during their duty at the isolation ward, sources said. “The safety measures for the staff are paramount. We have been insisting on all the safety protocols during their duty and home quarantine. No one should compromise on their health,” dean of MGMGH Dr K Vanitha told TOI.

Trichy district administration has also been providing hotel accommodation facility to the MGMGH staff on Covid-19 duty for over a month.
