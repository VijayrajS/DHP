Dehradun: To prevent any possibility of elephants catching the coronavirus infection, Uttarakhand forest department has barred all mahouts (those who work with, ride, and tend to an elephant) in the state from going out of the limits of the reserve (Corbett or Rajaji) in which they are currently deployed.

Speaking on the matter, Rajiv Bhartari, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, told TOI, “As a precautionary measure, we have decided to restrict the mahouts from moving out of the reserves.This is being done to protect them and wild animals from coronavirus.” 

The mahouts are also being closely monitored for signs of any infection , the official added.

The state has 26 elephants tendered by as many mahouts and majority of them are from Assam. 

The two tiger reserves — Corbett and Rajaji — have 16 and 6 elephants respectively. The other four private jumbos are under the custody of state forest department as per a high court order. Also, more than a hundred wild elephants are present in the state along with other wild animals like tigers, leopards, and deer, among others.

Additionally, all tourism activities are suspended inside the national parks/reserves from mid-March to keep all the animals protected from the virus.

“Any sick employee will have to undergo necessary medical tests to ensure that they do not have Covid-19,” Bhartari said.

Meanwhile, sanitisation drives are also being carried out at the elephant camps of the two reserves. 

“We have started sanitisation of elephants and their camps at Dhikala and Kalagarh. For tigers and other wild animals, we are still mulling upon ways to keep a close watch on them and track their health status,” said Rahul, director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, who uses only his first name.
