LUCKNOW: To ensure strict implementation of lockdown, the home department will soon deploy drone cameras across the state. Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi said, “Drone cameras will help the government monitor and crack down on violators, particularly those misusing permissions to purchase essentials. The chief minister wants there should be no violation of curbs,” he said.


Besides local police, the home department has deployed a parallel special task force to track Tablighi members, prepare their dossier along with their past history and keep an eye on their movements. Awasthi said, influx of Tablighis in the state posed a major challenge to the health department as it triggered a sudden surge in coronavirus cases.
