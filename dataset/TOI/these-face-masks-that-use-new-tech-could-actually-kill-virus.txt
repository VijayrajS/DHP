These face masks that use new technology could actually kill virus

RAJKOT: Scientists at the Bhavnagar-based Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) have developed a special mask using membrane technology that can give enhanced protection against pathogens, including virus and bacteria. The mask can kill the virus and bacteria that get attached on the outer surface that is made from a special material, scientists told TOI.


If this breakthrough research is medically validated, it could be a boon for not just common people but the entire medical fraternity, especially health workers who are in the forefront of battling the coronavirus pandemic.

 


Dr V K Shahi, head of membrane science & separation technology division of CSMCRI, told TOI, “This is a novel idea. The outer coating of is made from material that is anti-virus, antibacterial and anti-fungal. This means that any pathogen attached on the outer surface will be killed. These are superior to the N95 masks considered the best.”


Novel masks to cost less than Rs 50

The outer porous film is made from modified polysulfone material having a thickness of 150 micro metre. The material can kill any virus having a size of 60 nano metre (NM) and above. The coronavirus has a diameter of 80-120 NM,” he said.

At the same time, these masks are cost-effective, the production cost being around Rs 25 to Rs 45 as compared to Rs 100-Rs 300 of the best available in the market. The institute has developed five different variants of the masks having different kind of membranes and coated fabrics with multiple layers in them. CSMCRI plans to distribute these masks for free under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity.

The mask was developed in about a week and the medical validation is expected in a couple of days.
