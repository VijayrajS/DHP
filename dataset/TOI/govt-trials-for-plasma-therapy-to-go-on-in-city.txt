Covid-19: Delhi government says trials for plasma therapy to go on
2020-04-30
NEW DELHI: Trials for plasma therapy will continue in Delhi though the Centre has said it’s not an approved treatment for Covid-19 yet.

“Delhi government has already received Centre’s permission for trials. It is conducted only on serious patients and all prescribed procedures are strictly followed before patients undergo it,” said an official. The results will be shared with the Centre once the trials are over, he said. 

Four patients who underwent plasma therapy recently in a city hospital showed improvement in their health conditions. 

The Centre has said plasma therapy is a technical work that is at an experimental stage and nobody should try this without its permission, said health minister Satyendar Jain. “The trial has offered a ray of hope and the government is following all laid-down measures. Only some big institutions have the permission to conduct it,” he added.

The trial involves extracting plasma from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19. Delhi government has appealed to the recovered people to donate plasma.
