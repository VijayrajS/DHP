HYDERABAD: Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Sunday appealed to people to not give a communal colour to the spread of coronavirus. Interacting with party workers on a social media platform, Uttam said it was not prudent to blame a particular community for the spread of the virus. 


“Coronavirus is a pandemic and has been infecting and killing people irrespective of their region, religion, sex, caste or creed. This is a time of crisis and all Indians need to fight against the virus,” he said. He appealed to his party leaders and workers to act like soldiers in preventing the spread of coronavirus and also continue helping the poor and needy. 

“Cooperate with authorities in relief operations. The control room at Gandhi Bhavan is monitoring relief works carried out by party workers. Control rooms are also being set up in districts. Congress cadre needs to play the role of a constructive opposition and extend all help to needy,” Uttam said.
