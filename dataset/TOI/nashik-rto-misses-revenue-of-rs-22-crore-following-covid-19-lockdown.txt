Nashik: In wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) has missed a revenue of approximately Rs 22 crore in the 2019-20 fiscal year. 

Senior officials of Nashik RTO said that a major chunk of the revenue comes from registration fees of new vehicles every month. Since all the auto-mobile showrooms are closed for more than a month now, new vehicles are not getting registered with them.

The officials said that the annual revenue is to the tune of approximately Rs 300 crore every year. Thus, due to the lockdown for more than a month, they have missed revenue of approximately Rs 22 crore.

“We would not say it as a loss. People who had to buy vehicles have just not been able to do so due to the lockdown. Nonetheless, when the lockdown is relaxed and auto-mobile shops reopen, people would buy vehicles and new vehicles will be registered with the RTO,” said a senior RTO officer.

The RTO also generates revenue from the sale of VIP numbers and fines on motorists for violating rules like no driving license, transport permits, etc. 

The work of renewing fitness certificates of transport vehicles too has been stopped till June 30. Currently, only the issuing of permits for transport vehicles carrying essential goods is underway. 

Officials said that though goods transportation is allowed all through the country, the transporters are still taking permits from them to avoid any trouble at the check posts in various parts of the state and country.

Further, driving licenses and tests related to it would also be carried out only after the lockdown is over. The RTO officials said that the concerned applicants should be checking the website for further updates.
