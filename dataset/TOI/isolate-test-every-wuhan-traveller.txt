Coronavirus scare: ‘Isolate & test every Wuhan traveller’
2020-02-04
PUNE: Citizens with a travel history to Wuhan in China will be mandatorily isolated and tested for the novel coronavirus infection in Maharashtra even if they do not show any signs of the illness, state health department’s new guideline stated on Monday. 


Earlier, only travellers with flu-like symptoms were quarantined and their throat swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for testing.

“Only those travellers who had been to Wuhan, which is the epicentre of novel coronavirus outbreak in China, will be isolated and tested for the contagion even if they do not complain of any illness. The travellers who had been to other parts of China, excluding Wuhan, will only be quarantined and tested when they develop any illness,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.

Besides, China-returned people will be followed up to 14 days now to see if they develop any illness. “Earlier, travellers with a travel history to China were kept under observation for 28 days as there were doubts about the exact incubation period of the virus. Now, data suggest that a person after being exposed to the virus may develop illness within 14 days,” Awate said.
