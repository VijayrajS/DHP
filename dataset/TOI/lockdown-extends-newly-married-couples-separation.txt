Lockdown extends newly married couple's separation
2020-04-18
Surat: Lockdown has temporarily separated this 21-year-old woman from Dindoli area of the city from her husband just four days after their marriage. The woman had come to the city as a part of tradition on March 12 and was followed by her 12 relatives from Maharashtra to take her back. Now, all of them are stuck here because of lockdown. Sidhhika got married to Rohit, 24, a farmer in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra, on March 8. The marriage was held in Rajade village and Sidhhika stayed at her husband's house until March 12. She came to her parents’ house and was supposed to return after 10 days. Her mother-in-law and other 11 relatives arrived in the city on March 21 to take her back, but then ‘janata curfew’ and lockdown were announced. Since then all of them, who are residents of different places in Maharashtra, are living with the woman's family.The family is somehow managing food for so many guests as the groceries at home have completely exhausted. Arranging food and their accommodation have become a challenge for the family."Tradition mandates a newly married woman return to her parents' home for a few days. Her in-laws had arrived to take her back, but before they could leave lockdown was imposed," said Shantaram Marathe, father of the woman."We tried to send them in a hired van on April 14 when the first phase of lockdown was to end. But they were stopped in Tapi district and sent back," added Marathe, an employee in a textile market in the city. "I never imagined that the separation will be this long. It is over a month now. However, I regularly talk with my husband on phone," said Sidhhika."The actual married life of a couple starts only after the bride returns from her parents' home,” said a family member."I hope the lockdown ends soon or we find some way to send the guests and my daughter back to her husband's home," Marathe added.
