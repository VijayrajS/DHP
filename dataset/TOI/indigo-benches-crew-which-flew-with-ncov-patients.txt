2020-02-08
KOLKATA: IndiGo has de-rostered three sets of cabin crew who flew on the flights that carried the passengers tested positive for novel coronavirus to India from China last month.

The crew members — four from a Guangzhou-Kolkata flight on January 25 and eight others in two Kolkata-Kochi flights between January 24 and January 26 — have been asked to stay in home isolation and are being constantly monitored by the airline’s doctors. The crew members will be allowed to return to duty after the mandated fortnight-long self-quarantine process, if they do not develop any symptoms of coronavirus infection by then.


 

“The crew members were in close contact with the passengers that included the three confirmed nCoV victims, all of whom flew on IndiGo flights. Hence, as per the Union health ministry’s advice, the cabin crew have been de-rostered and kept under observation,” a senior official of the Kolkata airport said. The official added that none of the pilots were, however, sent on leave.

The decision was taken after it was found that all three confirmed patients affected by the novel Coronavirus had at some point, used IndiGo flights during their journey from China to Kerala via Kolkata.

The Union health ministry in a notification on January 30 had advised 14-day home isolation for everyone flying from China after January 15. IndiGoinitially maintained that their crew members had maintained precautions on board and were not staying back in China. The airport health organization has also started tracing all the co-passengers who had travelled with the three patients and are apprising the respective state administrations so that they can be quarantined.

TOI sought IndiGo’s comments on the de-rostering process, but there was no reply till late on Friday.
