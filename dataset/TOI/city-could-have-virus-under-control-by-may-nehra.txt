AHMEDABAD: If everything goes as planned, the city will be able to control the spread of Covid-19 by May 2020, municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said on Tuesday. “For this, we need 100% support of all residents. The fight will get extended if people do not cooperate with the authorities,” said Nehra.

The municipal commissioner urged all citizens to follow lockdown rules strictly.

“With cases being found though active surveillance, AMC is confident that the city will check the spread of the novel coronavirus by May,” said Nehra.

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has decided to increase bed capacity for Covid-19 patients to 1,000 from the existing 500 beds. The step has been taken to reduce the burden on Civil Hospital.

Nehra said that SVP Hospital will be reserved exclusively for Ahmedabad Covid-19 patients. “Earlier, we had made arrangement for 50 beds which was later increased to 500. Of these, 400 are at SVP,” he said.

“From today, SVP will have 1,000 beds for Covid patients, and this will be for patients from Ahmedabad,” said the municipal chief.

On the lines of Samras Hostel, a Covid-19 care centre will also be opened at Haj House in Kalupur. This will be for asymptomatic cases. The Haj House facility will open on Wednesday.

He said that the quarantine period for the 264 patients who were lodged at Haj House and Isha Foundation has ended. “Rapid antibody tests were performed on them and eight were found to be positive. These eight were then tested for Covid-19 and all returned negative,” he said.
