Covid isolation : KMC scouts for resorts on city outskirts
2020-04-24
Kolkata: Having failed to convert two civic properties in the city into Covid-19 quarantine centres, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has started looking for resorts or community halls on the outskirts for the purpose.

The KMC health department had planned to convert a new multi-storied building on CN Roy Road in Topsia and another at Parnasree Palli into quarantine centres. However, due to protests from locals the state health department has asked the civic body to desist from setting up the centres in densely populated areas. 

Accordingly, the KMC has shifted its focus to properties outside the city limits. According to a KMC official, they are now looking at some resorts lying idle since the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown. 

Though the civic authorities are yet to zero in on any resort, sources in the KMC said the civic top brass could be eyeing a few resorts off Diamond Harbour Road (around Joka) and in the Rajarhat-New Town area.

Apart from this, the KMC officials are also looking for some community halls either owned by the civic body or the state government outside the residential areas.
