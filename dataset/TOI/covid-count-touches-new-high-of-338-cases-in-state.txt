JAIPUR: A day after the state government issued fresh guidelines for lockdown 4.0, Covid-19 count touched a new high of 338 cases in the state on Tuesday. It is for the second consecutive time that Covid-19 figures breached the 300-mark in the state. The first time this happened was on Monday when the state recorded 305 cases. 


The state recorded five deaths — two from Jaipur and one each from Kota, Nagaur and Sikar, bringing the toll to 143. The total cases stand at 5,845. 

Dungarpur reported highest number of cases as 87 migrants were found infected with the virus. “All of them travelled by buses from Mumbai. We have kept them at quarantine facilities. There were only 15 cases in Dungarpur three days ago but with more migrants reaching here, the tally has increased to 211. All fresh cases in past three days are migrants. All of them have travelled from Mumbai,” said a senior health department official in Dungarpur. 

In Pali too, the situation is more or less the same. “Here, 77 persons were found infected with the virus. Out of them, 36 are those who travelled by trains from Mumbai, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,” said a health department official in Pali. 

The continuous fresh spike in the state is mainly due to the increasing number of migrants entering the state and testing positive for Covid-19. It has been happening for the past six days that each day, the state is setting a new record of Covid-19 cases reported in a single day. On May 14, state breached the 200-mark for the first time and reported 206 cases. On the next day, it recorded another high with 213 cases, followed by 213, 242 and 305 in past three days, before it touched 338 cases on Tuesday. 

Since May 1, as many as 888 migrants have tested positive for Covid-19. Out of these, 232 were diagnosed on Tuesday.
