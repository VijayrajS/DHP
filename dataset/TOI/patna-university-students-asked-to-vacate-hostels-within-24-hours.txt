A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting of all PU officials and wardens and superintendents of hostels held under the chairmanship of pro-vice-chancellor Dolly Sinha. They felt that the hostels were not safe for the students and hence, they must be asked to go to their respective native places.

PU central dispensary chief medical officer Richa Sharma, who was present on the occasion, pointed out that the dispensary was not fully prepared to face the threat posed by corona. The number of nurses and sweepers was far from satisfactory and the dispensary lacked even essential medical facilities. The CMO was, however, asked by PU authorities to set up an isolation ward at the dispensary and make necessary preparations for providing necessary medical facilities to the suspected victims.

Patna University Students’ Union representatives initially opposed the decision to get the hostels vacated in view of the pending examinations, but on persuasion of the authorities they agreed. It was decided that the hostels would be opened for students at least a week before the commencement of the postponed examinations.

Principals of colleges and wardens and superintendents of all undergraduate and postgraduate hostels have been directed to ensure eviction of all the rooms of their hostels within the next 24 hours, said PU students’ welfare dean N K Jha.
