2020-06-03
Nagpur: Expressing concern over citizens not coming to help the government in containing Covid-19 pandemic, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court orally observed the authorities were doing a commendable job and they should be encouraged.

A division bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor on Tuesday also directed the respondents, including Amravati administration, to explain the reasons behind not collecting swab samples of dead patients.

“Even the reputed NGOs are not volunteering or sending their doctors to help the administration. How many of us have gone to the streets and distributed food packets? It is very easy to file cases in HC. We must help the authorities and collectively fight the battle against deadly virus. HC is there only if Centre and states aren’t responding or providing funds,” the judges said.

While hearing a petition by petitioner Shivaray Kulkarni through counsel Pankaj Navlani pressing for stringent measures to control the growth of coronavirus in Amravati, the judges noted that HC had passed orders on March 23 to release funds in initial days. “Now, the purpose of petition is served and therefore, we want to dispose of it. We find that petitioner’s prayers are by and large worked out,” the judges stated.

Earlier, Navlani contended the Amravati collector had made a statement in a press conference on April 28 that oral and nasal swab samples of the dead patients wouldn’t be collected. He pointed out no deaths were reported due to Covid-19 virus in the district since then. He also submitted media reports on collector’s announcement.

“These facts are relevant and respondents should explain on it within a week,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing.

Jemini Kasat held brief for Amravati Municipal Corporation (AMC) while assistant solicitor general of India Ulhas Aurangabadkar pleaded for the central government.
