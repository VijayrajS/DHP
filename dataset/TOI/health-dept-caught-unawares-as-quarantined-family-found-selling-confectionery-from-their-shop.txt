Pilibhit: Health department officials were caught unawares by a family of nine people in Punjabiyan locality under Pilibhit-Kotwali police station, who were found selling confectionery items from their shop near their home, after they had been put under 14-day home quarantine on March 29, when some members returned from Noida. Additional chief medical officer Dr C M Chaturvedi has now referred the matter to the tehsildar, Pilibhit (sadar).The matter came to light after a well-known resident of Punjabiyan locality who preferred to remain anonymous, sent an alert about the family of Faraz Shamsi, who had been put under home quarantine by the health department, who also stuck a notice to this effect outside their residence.It now appears the Shamsi family had been selling confectionery from their shop near their home on Punjabiyan-Pakaria road from the day they were quarantined. This may have communicated Covid-19 infection to hundreds of locals if it is later found that any member of the family who was involved in selling confectionary is infected with the virus, whose symptoms are not visible in the primary stage — said the whistleblower over the phone, while sending photos of the open shop to mediapersons.Additional CMO Chaturvedi said the department was unaware of the incident. “I’ll immediately refer it to the Pilibhit (sadar) tehsildar for taking appropriate action.”When questioned if the lapse in monitoring people under home quarantine was a failure of the department, Chaturvedi said, “Our practice is giving phone calls to these families to repeat departmental instructions asking them to remain strictly confined to their homes. We send their blood samples for testing of Covid-19 only if anyone shows primary symptoms like cough, sore throat, sneezing, etc,” he said.
