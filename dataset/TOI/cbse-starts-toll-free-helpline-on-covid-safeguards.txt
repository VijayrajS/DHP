2020-03-23
LUDHIANA: While the 23rd edition of free-of-cost CBSE annual pre-exam psychological live tele-counselling for students taking Class X and XII exam in 2020 is currently on from 8am to 10pm, the board has recently decided to also start a helpline for students to create awareness on coronavirus. This facility is available on the same toll-free number: 1800 11 8004 from 8am to 8pm, initially up to March 31.


CBSE has also played a proactive role in creating mass awareness in the public by way of memes on social media platforms, issuing guidelines to students/parents and schools for creating awareness about the virus and its prevention, or even changing seating arrangements in exam halls to avoid the spread of the virus.

As a precautionary measure, on March 18, the board decided to rescheduling the remaining Class X/XII exams, scheduled between March 19 and 31, and has also suspended evaluation work. The dedicated coronavirus safeguard tele-counselling service will be provided by additional trained counsellors, who will deal with students/parents for preventive interventions, reducing transmission, and counselling on first aid to stop the spread of the virus. They will also assist students to engage in useful and productive activities while at home.
