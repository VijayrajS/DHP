Valpoi: Alarmed over reports of two coronavirus cases in Sattari taluka, Keri residents have voluntarily imposed a four-day lockdown in the villege from Monday.

Keri sarpanch Govind Gawas said the villagers have decided to self-isolate and not move out from their homes, even going to the extent of closing shops in order to curb the transmission of Covid-19. 

In view of the lockdown, villagers have stocked up on essential supplies. 

“As Covid positive cases have been detected in neighbouring Morle and Guleli villages, Keri locals as well as the panchayat have unanimously decided for a lockdown,” Gawas said.

Panchayat member Laxman Gawas told TOI that the villagers have decided not to allow vehicles passing along the Goa-Karnataka highway to halt in Keri.

Devendra Gawas, a resident, said that government staff working in the health and police departments will continue with their duties. However, those employed in the private sector have decided not to attend till Thursday, he said. “Only banks and medical stores are functioning in the village. Depending on the prevailing situation, the villagers may extend the lockdown,” he said.
