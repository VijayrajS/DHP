This information is to be provided to police/registration officer along with Form-C duly filled by the foreigner guest, including copy of guest’s passport and visa. Those looking to lessen, but not totally avoid, paperwork can login to Bureau of Immigration website.

After going online, hotels have to fill details on Form-C there. You can submit it but still its printout is to be submitted to police within 24 hours of such foreigners’ check-in.
