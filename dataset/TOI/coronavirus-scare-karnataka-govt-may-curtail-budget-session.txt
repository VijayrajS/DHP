However, there are indications that it may be curtailed. “A final decision will be taken at the business advisory committee meeting on Monday,” sources said, indicating the session is likely to conclude over the next weekend after completion of pending business.

Some MLAs said they will prevail upon the CM to prevent strain on the administration and allow legislators to visit their constituencies and monitor the situation.

“Several MLAs are already skipping the session due to Covid-19 fears or attending it only for a brief period. There is no point in holding it without adequate quorum,’’ some ruling party MLAs said.
