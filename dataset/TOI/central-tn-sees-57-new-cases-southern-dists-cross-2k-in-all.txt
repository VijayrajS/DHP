Tuticorin district collector Sandeep Nanduri told TOI that there were no discrepancies in reporting Covid-19 cases. “We have had many cases of people who came from other districts for a short stay here. Since they tested positive here, the cases were first attributed to Tuticorin. However, now we reconciled cases back to their native districts. At least 18 cases have been cross-notified in the past few days,” he said.
