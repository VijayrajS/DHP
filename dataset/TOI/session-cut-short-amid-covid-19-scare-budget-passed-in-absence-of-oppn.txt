Karnataka: Session cut short amid Covid-19 scare; budget passed in absence of opposition
2020-03-25
BENGALURU: The budget session of the legislature was cut short on Tuesday in the midst of growing concerns about the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri adjourned the session sine die after the house passed the budget for 2020-21.


The budget session was scheduled till March 31. However, members of the opposition and treasury benches urged the government to curtail it in the wake of the lockdown enforced in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. The issue was discussed in the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting convened by the speaker on Monday where Congress members urged the government to suspend the session immediately, but the ruling party stuck to its guns that it would be adjourned only after chief minister BS Yediyurappa replies to the budget debate on Tuesday.

While the Congress boycotted the assembly session on Tuesday, members of JD(S) walked out protesting the government’s rejection to hold a discussion on an alleged scam in a cooperative society. The house passed the appropriation bill and approved demand for grants in the absence of the opposition after Yediyurappa replied to the debate.

“It is undemocratic on the part of the ruling party, which chose to pass the budget when the entire opposition stayed away. We wanted the government to pass a vote-on-account for three or four months before suspending the session and seek approval for the full budget later when the house is reassembled. But the government did not heed our plea as it didn’t want to accommodate the views of the opposition,” said leader of opposition Siddaramaiah.
