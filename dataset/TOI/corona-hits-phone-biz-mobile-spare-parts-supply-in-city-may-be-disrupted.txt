Coronavirus hits phone biz: Mobile spare parts’ supply in Hyderabad may be disrupted
2020-02-08
HYDERABAD: With no let-up in the coronovirus outbreak in China, Hyderabad’s mobile phone repair market in Abids and Secunderabad, which largely depend on spare parts from China, could take a hit.

People throng Jagdish Market in Abids and Gujarati Galli, Koti, for purchasing mobile phone accessories and spare parts, which primarily are sourced from China.

Merchants at the Jagdish Market said that though they have stock of Chinese mobile phones, they would soon run out of the stocks. “We are facing shortage of spare parts. Some of these spare parts are costly and customers prefer coming to us instead of going to bigger showrooms which charge them a huge price,” Ahmed Pasha, a merchant, said.

“My cellphone was given for repair after the touch screen went kaput. I did not want to spend Rs 5,000 or Rs 6,000 at a high-end shop. I went to Jadish Market for a replacement, but I could not find one,” said V Sunita, a techie from Himayatnagar.

The cellphone market in Secunderabad is also hit with supplies from China dwindling. 

Along with the cellphone spare parts, the Chinese toy market in the city is also facing the heat. “We are not getting any plastic toys from China since 10 days. The prices have gone up by 20%. We are running out of stock and our business is hit badly,” AK Agarwal, a wholesale merchant in Gujarati Galli, said.
