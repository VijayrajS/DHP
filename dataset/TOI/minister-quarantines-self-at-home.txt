Jaipur: State cooperatives minister Uday Lal Anjana on Monday put himself in home quarantine following an avalanche of cases in his constituency Nimbahera. In a self-made video released by him, the minister said he was shocked that his town was severely hit by coronavirus. 

He made an astonishing claim that he had came in contact with those who tested positive for covid-19 in the last few days while discharging his duties as the MLA of Nimbahera. 

“I am safe and have put under self-isolation at my residence,” the minister said. He didn’t mince words in accusing the administration for it’s laxity in implementing the restrictions during the lockdown. 

He fervently appealed to people to strictly follow lockdown norms. “You should not worry about whether you are getting vegetables or milk on time or not. It is an emergency-like situation and we shouldn’t care about supplies. We will not die if we will not get supplies for a day or two. Most importantly, we all have to stay safe follow social distancing at any cost to defeat the spread of the virus in our town,” Anjana said.
