Dumka: The two Covid-19 patients of Deoghar were released from hospital on Sunday after their second round of tests returned negative, district authorities said. 

The discharged patients, both migrant workers, were given a grand send-off by doctors, hospital staff and deputy commissioner Nancy Sahay from their isolation ward in the morning. Sahay said, “Both of them were given bouquets and sweets. We congratulated them for beating the deadly virus.” 

The workers, both in their teens, were emotional after receiving the grand send-off. “The care we were given by doctors and hospital staff was overwhelming,” the duo said. 

They was sent to their homes in Gamhariya and Bhurkunda villages under Bhurkunda block of the district in two separate ambulances. 

Earlier, both were taken to a private hospital, which was designated as a Covid-19 facility, from their respective quarantine centres on April 20 and April 24 after their blood and swab samples tested positive for the virus. 

In Garhwa, the second samples of a 24-year-old man from the district’s Pathan Toli area tested negative. The man, who was released from Ranchi’s Lake View Hospital on March 31, had tested positive after showing symptoms of Covid-19 on April 22. 

Garhwa deputy commissioner Harsh Mangla said, “Two of his family members are currently lodged at the Covid-19 centre in Maral as they have shown some symptoms of the virus. We have sent their samples to Rims (in Ranchi) and they should reach us soon.” 

Civil surgeon Dr N K Rajak said, “The two family members’ swab samples have been sent for an examination, the report of which is awaited.”
