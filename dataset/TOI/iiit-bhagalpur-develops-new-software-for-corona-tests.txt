IIIT-Bhagalpur develops new software for coronavirus tests
2020-05-16
BHAGALPUR: The Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Bhagalpur, has developed a software that can read chest X-ray films or plates and diagnose whether a patient has contracted the Covid-19 virus or not.


Authorities at IIIT, Bhagalpur, said that the software can read scanned chest X-ray film or plate scanned and uploaded in a computer in less than one second. They also claimed that the cost of diagnosis for Covid-19 using this software will be less than Rs 100 in comparison to conventional microbiological swab test which varies between Rs 3,500 to 5,000.

IIIT director Prof Arvind Choubey, who along with assistant professor Sandip Raj have developed the software said that sample testing with the help of this technology in presence of a team of doctors and experts at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH) was 100% successful.

“Chest X-rays of more than 20 persons were uploaded in the computer and the software gave 100% result and matched with the conventional microbiological swab tests. Software analysis accuracy is expected to be around 95-96%, with only 4-5% of error or less dependent on other factors,” Prof Choubey said.

He added, “We are forwarding the information regarding the software technology-based diagnosis of Covid-19 to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Union ministry of health and ministry of human resources development. The software can be used with digital X-Ray machines, besides computed tomography imaging machine (CT Scan) for detection of the virus.”

JLNMCH Superintendent Dr R C Mandal said that this new technology is ‘extraordinary’ and can be helpful in detection of Covid-19 within seconds. “We look forward to further work on this technology,” said Dr Mandal.

JLNMCH principal Dr Hemant Kumar Sinha said, “We will ask our radiology department to learn the technology and utilize it.”
