2020-03-12
SECUNDERABAD: No person suffering from symptoms of coronavirus was detected in the one-day door-to-door survey conducted on Wednesday at Mahendra Hills in Secunderabad Cantonment. 

Mahendra Hills had garnered national headlines after a 24-year-old resident was tested positive for Covid-19, in Telangana’s first confirmed case. 

As the virus scare resulted into the area coming to a standstill, Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and health department swung into action for sanitation work. Efforts to identify persons affected by the virus are also being made. 

“Special teams from the state medical and health department and the Cantonment board on Wednesday deployed teams in Ravi Colony, Trimurthy Colony, Dhanalakshmi Colony, Vyjayanthi Colony, Balamari Society and Shantiniketan Colony to conduct a door-to-door survey. The teams visited nearly 2,000 houses and enquired about any person suffering from cough, cold or fever,” M Devender, senior superintendent of health and family wing, SCB, told TOI. 

No possible cases were detected, the official added. The teams advised the residents to follow protective measures and told them about the efforts taken by SCB. 

The survey report will be submitted to the state government (health department), said an official.

Residents of Mahendra Hills and abutting areas have started attending their daily works as state health minister Etala Rajender has announced that the affected person is safe.
