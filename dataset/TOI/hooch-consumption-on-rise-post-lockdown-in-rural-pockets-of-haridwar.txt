Hooch consumption on rise post lockdown in rural pockets of Haridwar
2020-06-12
Haridwar: Hooch consumption has significantly increased after lockdown was imposed in Haridwar, especially in rural areas as homemade liquor is being preferred by the villagers as it is cheaper than country-made liquor. According to villagers, due to the lockdown, alcoholics don’t have enough money to buy liquor. Hooch, on the other hand, is not only easily available but also a cheaper option. Hooch is being supplied to both rural and city areas.Last year, the state had witnessed one of its worst hooch tragedies in the Haridwar area in which almost 50 people had died. Meanwhile, police claimed that action is being taken against the hooch mafia.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Haridwar Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S said, “We have destroyed around 45,000 litres of hooch and its raw material. Several cases were registered against the hooch mafia. We have also requested the locals to support our campaign and help us spread awareness.”Pathri, Shyampur, Bhagwanpur, Jahbreda, Laksar and Bhadrabad region of the district are strongholds of hooch mafia where many villagers are involved in the business. Sources said that hooch is prepared with sugarcane, which is easily available as farmers like to grow sugarcane in these areas. Many incidents have surfaced in the past where hooch furnaces were found in the fields of sugarcane. The hooch mafia has also developed a supply chain in which women play a major role in smuggling hooch.Local activist Ajab Singh told TOI, “Post lockdown, hooch is being prepared on an even larger scale. The Hooch mafia took advantage of the closure of liquor shops and now the demand for hooch has increased as it is cheaper than other liquor. Villagers who lost their jobs and those who do not have enough money to buy IMFL are now consuming hooch. It is a dangerous trend and it may cause another hooch tragedy.”
