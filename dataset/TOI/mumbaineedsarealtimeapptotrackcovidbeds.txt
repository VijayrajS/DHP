2020-06-03
Recently read about the measures taken by the Delhi government for real time tracking of covid19 beds across the hospitals in Delhi.In this age of technology Mumbai too desperately needs such technology to make lives easy in such difficult times. The Delhi app is being updated twice a day and if a bed is not being assigned inspite of its availability a complaint can be made to the authorities.This is such an incredible move. Is Mumbai listening? We too need to use technology to its fullest. BMC please upgrade, let's move forward we have vast resources!
