Vadodara: On Wednesday, residents of Sanskarinagri were under constant vigil lest they crack April Fool jokes on Coronavirus. The detection of crime branch (DCB) warned Barodians not to send memes or jokes about Covid-19. 

“The virus has become the talk of the town and there were chances that people may have posted jokes on it on April Fool’s day. Even humorous memes and jokes can fuel rumours and we didn’t want to take any chances. So people were warned against sharing anything on it,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

The cops kept watch on the social media and WhatsApp groups and came across many such jokes. “But they were not harmful or spreading rumours. So we haven’t filed any case against anyone,” Jadeja said.

The crime branch has been keeping an eye on different social media platforms over the last few days to ensure that mischief mongers don’t spread rumours regarding the virus or even the patients.
