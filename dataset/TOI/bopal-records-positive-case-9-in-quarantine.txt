Ahmedabad: On Monday, a 48-year-old man from Bopal tested positive for Covid. Ahmedabad district health department officials said that the man works at a unit in Ramol. He had fever since March 31 and had visited the community health centre (CHC) at Ghuma for treatment. Doctors later suggested a Covid test for him.

The department officials have started tracing all the persons the man had come in contact with. Any person with symptoms associated with Covid will be quarantined and tested, they added.

This is the fourth positive case for Ahmedabad district outside the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) limits. Officials said that they are not considering it a case of cluster spread.

“The man’s family has been counselled and so have his neighbours and society members to remain in quarantine. They have all agreed,” Ahmedabad collector K K Nirala said. “The society’s daily provisions and routine health check-ups will be taken care of by us.”
