JAIPUR: A 90-year-old man who was admitted to Sawai Man Singh Hospital on April 14 after being tested Covid-19 positive, was cured and discharged on Tuesday. 

On April 25, Bhawani Shankar Sharma tested negative for Covid-19 for the first time. Doctors conducted his test again on April 27 and he tested negative. 

“After recovering from coronavirus infection, Sharma was discharged on Tuesday for home quarantine,” said an SMS Hospital administration official.

“He is suffering from hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health). 

Hospital’s core treatment group comprising Dr Sudhir Bhandari, Dr Raman Sharma, Dr Prakash Keswani, Dr S Banerjee and Dr Ajit Singh took the crucial decision on his treatment. To prevent mortality due to Covid-19, the health department has launched LISA (lifesaving) campaign. Under the campaign, the health department will identify people who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and come under high-risk group.

Besides, OPD vans are providing treatment in Covid-19 affected areas.

“To provide healthcare in the difficult times, the state has started mobile OPD through 422 vans equipped with health professionals and medicines. About 50,000 residents of curfew-bound areas and remote places have been served over the last three days. Mobile OPD service was provided to the patients in Ramganj on Tuesday,” Rohit Kumar Singh said.
