2020-05-20
JAIPUR: Laboratory technicians, who had boycotted work on Monday, resumed testing of Covid samples in the state on Tuesday. It may be noted that a clash had broken out between doctors and laboratory technicians at microbiology lab of Sawai Man Singh Medical College on Monday. 


A meeting of both factions with additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh was held on Tuesday in which Singh decided to conduct an inquiry into the matter by an IAS officer. Also, the suspension order of the lab technician was withdrawn. But, it was decided that the lab technician will not get the posting at SMS Hospital’s microbiology laboratory. He has been transferred to Institute of Respiratory diseases in Shastri Nagar.

After resolving the issues, Singh said, “In these stressful times of a pandemic that we are all facing, there is a greater need to work together and respect each other. Everyone, right from the top to the bottom, is fighting this battle as a team. Team health Rajasthan is extremely proud of the positive contribution that each one is making to defeat Coronavirus. Focused dedication, camaraderie, bonhomie and working hand in hand are the only mantra for success to meet this challenge. I am sure that Rajasthan shall overcome this too.”

Meanwhile, Medical College Teachers Association of Rajasthan (MCTAR) wrote to SMS Medical College principal and controller Dr Sudhir Bhandari. “In an unprecedented manner, the suspended culprit in the matter has been reinstated just for the reason that he could build enough pressure on the government. MCTAR has threatened the government to reconsider its stand on the issue in two days, failing which they will be forced to take some strong steps from May 22.
