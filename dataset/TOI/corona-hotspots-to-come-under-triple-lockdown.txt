Coronavirus hotspots in Kerala to come under ‘triple lockdown’
2020-04-26
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State police chief Loknath Behera on Saturday said vehicular movement across state borders with Tamil Nadu will be regulated for 60 hours from Sunday to Tuesday in the wake of the complete lockdown announced by Tamil Nadu government. Tamil Nadu had announced a complete lockdown in major cities, restricting all public movement from Sunday to Tuesday as part of intensifying its fight against the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. 

Behera said motorists will not be allowed to pass the border and enter Tamil Nadu. The movement of goods vehicles will also be strictly regulated. State borders have been reinforced with additional personnel. 

The DGP also said that Kasaragod-model of ‘triple lockdown’ will be emulated in regions identified as Covid-19 hotspots by the state government. 

It involves restricting people’s movement in and out of the region identified as hotspots by closing down all entry/exit points, barring one. It will enable police to keep a tab on each person who enters or exits the region. The police will deliver essential commodities at doorsteps to prevent people from coming out of their residences. Senior police officers will be assigned to oversee the arrangements put in place in hotspots. 

Behera further said that in the wake of government deciding to relax restrictions on lockdown, the police will assist merchants to ensure that customers adhere to social distancing norms when shops are opened. All station house officers of local police stations have been given directions in this regard.
