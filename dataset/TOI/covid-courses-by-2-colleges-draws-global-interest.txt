There were 52 participants from states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala, which included 13 participants with PhD degrees. The participants included 129 students and 148 faculty members and industry personnel and others,” he said.

The main objective of this programme, called ‘Pandemics: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow’, was to encourage students to pursue research and higher education related to pandemics and the evolution of antiviral drugs.
