VADODARA: A plethora of problems are surfacing at GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri which house Vadodara’s dedicated COVID-19 hospital and hostel premises where suspects are kept under quarantine.


On Saturday, videos recorded by three patients, including two suspects and a COVID-19 positive patient, went viral on social media.

An unidentified female recorded a video of dirty washrooms where water is either not being supplied or supply is not enough to meet a patient’s requirement. She can be heard questioning how people can stay in such unhygienic conditions.

In another video, a man who identifies himself as Bijal Shah claimed that he had come to the hospital for COVID-19 test on April 15 after he had chest pain, but has not received test results till date.

“I was told that my reports will arrive within 24 hours. But on Saturday afternoon, I was told by the staff that they don’t know the whereabouts of the samples sent to SSG Hospital. I was asked to give my samples for the third time,” he said, adding that despite being a suspect he has been allocated a room on a floor which also has 4-5 COVID-19 positive patients.

Shakeel Ala, a resident of Nagarwada, complained that doctors are not addressing his problems even as he had voluntarily arrived at the hospital where he later tested positive.

Ala said while he appreciates work done by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and police department, doctors at Gotri hospital are not addressing his simple queries like getting hot water.

Officials of GMERS Medical College and Hospital rued that some patients are making unreasonable demands at the time of a crisis when the entire focus is on treatment.

Dr Minoo Patel, honorary adviser to the hospital, told TOI that he will look into the concerns raised by the patients. “I will ask the staff, who are handling the premises, to look into these complaints,” he said.
