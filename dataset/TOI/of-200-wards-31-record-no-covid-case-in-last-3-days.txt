2020-05-20
CHENNAI: In the last three days, around 31 of the 200 wards in the city have not recorded a single Covid-19 case, said J Radhakrishnan, special officer on deputation to Greater Chennai Corporation, on Tuesday.

 


Radhakrishnan also said that 136 wards recorded less than 10 cases cumulatively in the same period. He used this data to buttress the fact that Covid-19 was not spreading across entire Chennai, but was restricted to specific pockets in the city. “Four zones in the city are the problem areas. Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar and Kodambakkam. However, the rate of increase in number of cases in Kodambakkam and Valasaravakkam has started reducing,” Radhakrishnan said.

Based on this analysis, the civic body will now roll out a new plan for every ward which has a high incidence of cases. Corporation health workers equipped with mobile X-ray scanning machines as well as thermal scanners, will be deployed in these wards to screen 200 homes every day, Radhakrishnan said.

Some of the areas in Royapuram where this would be started are Anjenaya Street, Bojarajan Nagar and Annai Sathya Nagar, he added.

According to a ward-wise Covid-19 incidence map released by the corporation on Tuesday evening, Muthialpet (ward 56), Seethakathi Nagar (60), Panamarathotti (50), George Town (59) have 41-124 cases per lakh population. These wards fall under Royapuram zone. In Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, Pulianthope (ward 77) has an incidence of 124-242 cases per lakh population. The map shows this is the ward with the highest case incidence in the city.

Sembium (68) is a shade lower and has an incidence of 41-124 cases per lakh population. Wards in other zones which have 41-124 cases per lakh population include Koyambedu, Ambattur, Maduravoyal, Nerkundram, Tondiarpet, Periyamedu and Krishnamapet.

A look at the map shows that major part of south Chennai barely has any ward which has cases above 14 per lakh population. GCC data shows that four southern zones Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Shollinganallur have only 16, 22, 17 and 22 containment streets.

In comparison, Royapuram alone has 130 containment streets, which is more than those of the four southern zones put together.
