2020-03-11
KOLKATA: Gour Purnima, the biggest festival of Iskcon, was celebrated at its headquarters in Mayapur with a lot of caution on Monday, thanks to the coronavirus scare. Since nearly a lakh devotees had gathered for the celebrations, many of them foreign devotees, a massive medical screening was arranged for each of them under the directions of the state government.


Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had asked the Kolkata centre of Iskcon for details of the medical arrangements. Accordingly, a doctor from the state health services, Malabika Paul, has been deputed for five days at Mayapur to oversee the work of the internal medical team. This team has three doctors — Soumik Debnath, Lipika Sharma and Santosh Roy. The district magistrate and his team have also been co-ordinating with the Iskcon authorities.

A statement from Mayapur said that all foreign devotees who have come in for the celebrations after January 1 have been screened. The Chinese devotees were asked not to fly in and there were a large number of cancellations from them voluntarily. A dedicated Facebook page has also been set up by the Iskcon Mayapur authorities that carry all the directives regarding precautions that have been taken and need to be taken. 

“Notice boards have been set up at prominent places to spread awareness among the devotees,” said Subrata Das, spokesperson of Iskcon Mayapur.
