2020-06-15
KOLKATA: A fresh Covid-19 case was reported from the Alipore Zoo staff quarters that has sent the officials scurrying for quarantine facilities. The patient is a senior gardener at the zoo. On June 11, he had developed fever and was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital on June 12. His corona positive report came on Saturday. 


However, there is some relief since the disease has so far not affected the zookeepers, the men who attend to animals. KMC officials said they have initiated a complete disinfection process inside the zoo. 

Immediately after the confirmation of the gardener’s having tested positive for the virus came, the zoo authorities sealed the quarters and asked all the zookeepers, gardeners and their family members living in the quarters to go for home quarantine. Four gardeners and six zookeepers live in the quarters, said an official.

“The family members of the gardener have been advised home isolation and we have sealed the entire building. The zookeepers and gardeners have also been asked to stay in home quarantine for the next 14 days. Further, we are trying to trace all other zoo staffers who had come in contact with the infected gardener in the last few days,” said Asis Samanta, the zoo director.

Samanta added that all those quarantined have been asked to stay off duty for the next 14 days while other zookeepers and gardeners will fill in their places. The zoo has around 90-odd keepers and gardeners.

The quarters, located close to the aquarium, a five-star hotel and the National Library, came under Alipore police’s scrutiny. 

“We will speak to the zoo authorities to ascertain if they need any assistance as far as ration supply for those in quarantine is concerned,” said a police officer.
