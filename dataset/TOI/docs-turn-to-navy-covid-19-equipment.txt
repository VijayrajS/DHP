Visakhapatnam doctors turn to Navy Covid-19 equipment
2020-05-08
VISAKHAPATNAM: Equipment designed to provide oxygen supply simultaneously to multiple Covid-19 patients has come in handy in treating people affected by the styrene leak. 


Naval Dockyard-Visakhapatnam (ND-V) had designed the ‘portable multi-feed oxygen manifold’ equipment in March, using a six-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder. After successful trials, it began manufacturing a portable version of the equipment with two six-way radial headers to provide oxygen to several coronavirus patients at a time.

On Thursday, soon after the gas tragedy unfolded, doctors at KGH used the equipment to put several patients on oxygen supply simultaneously to reduce the impact of exposure as well as to prevent damage to the brain and vital organs. They also shifted two of them to the incident site for quick treatment.

“The Indian Navy has provided five more such equipment to KGH. Technical teams from ND-V helped in quick installation of the equipment to provide oxygen to a large number of patients. The portable systems have been designed in such a manner that six patients can be given oxygen supply from one jumbo-size bottle,” said a spokesperson of the Eastern Naval Command.
