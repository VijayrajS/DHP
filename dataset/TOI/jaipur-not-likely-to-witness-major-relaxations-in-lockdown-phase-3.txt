According to officials, the only change will be private offices will be allowed to open with 33% of the staff. 

A police official said, “According to the advisory by the Centre, probably the only relaxation is for private offices. Also as per the previous advisory, standalone shops and stores in residential areas will be allowed to open from Monday.” 

The lockdown guidelines say no person should move out of their homes unless in case of emergency or to procure essential goods and medicines. 

No lockdown pass will be issued to the residents of areas under curfew while travel passes are required for people of other areas.
