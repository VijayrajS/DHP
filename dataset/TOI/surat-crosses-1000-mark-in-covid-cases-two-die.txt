SURAT: Twenty-nine new Covid-19 cases took their total number in the city to 1,020 on Saturday. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials said 11 out of 29 cases were detected in Limbayat zone, a Covid-19 hotspot. Of the total coronavirus cases, this zone alone accounts for 389 of them. 

Meanwhile, two persons succumbed to coronavirus during the day, taking the Covid-19 toll in the city to 48. 



"Till now, a total of 48 people have succumbed to Covid-19 in the city. Of these, 43 patients were suffering from co-morbid conditions like diabetes, blood pressure, hypertension heart and kidney ailments. We observed that people do not immediately report to hospitals when they fall ill. They go to hospitals only after they become really serious, but by then it's too late. I request people to immediately contact hospitals if they notice any symptoms of the virus in them. This will help us to save more lives,'' municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said. 

"We have launched a massive door-to-door APX survey in the most affected areas of the city. A house is marked ‘A’ if we find any member there with acute respiratory infection or other symptoms, ‘P’ if there are elders in a house with co-morbid conditions and ‘X’ in case nothing is suspected in the dwelling. During the last few days, our survey has recorded 2.73 lakh people with co-morbid conditions in the most affected areas. We are keeping a watch on people with co-morbid conditions because they are susceptible to the virus,'' Pani said. 

Meanwhile, the recovery rate in the city has jumped to 65.9 per cent with discharge of 20 more Covid-19 patients on Saturday.
