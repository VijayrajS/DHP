Vijayawada: Increased awareness about Covid-19 and social responsibility made the Janata Curfew a success in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday. 

Irrespective of political affiliations and differences of view, people from all walks of life joined the initiative and stayed home to make it an unprecedented shutdown in the history of the state.

The ongoing Information Education Communication (IEC) activities of the government on Covid-19 and increasing number of suspected cases have made people aware of the importance of social distancing. 

Several NGOs and political parties also called upon the public to participate in the curfew. When TOI visited various parts of Vijayawada on Sunday, there were few persons or vehicles on the roads. Almost all shops, commercial establishments and organisations voluntarily shut their operations, making it an informal lockdown. 

Speaking to TOI, Singaluri Srikrishna, an IIT-JEE maths coaching faculty said the 14-hour curfew was called by the Prime Minister in the best interests of the people and to contain and break the chain of Covid-19. “The curfew received an overwhelming response due to the underlying positive message attached to it,” said Srikrishna.

However, a few people suffered on Sunday due to the closure of restaurants and other eateries, particularly job aspirants and students staying in rented accommodations. 

A few NGOs came to the rescue of the homeless by distributing food packets in various parts of the state.
