A ‘nikaah’ within lockdown norms that also fed the poor
2020-04-22
Nagpur: The lockdown had compelled many to reschedule their marriage plans but the Qazis of Bande Nawaz Nagar thought differently.

Instead of postponing their elder son Mohsinuddin’s ‘nikaah’ to Nasrin, they used the opportunity to set an example of how to follow all the norms of social distancing, personal hygiene and avoiding even the permissible gathering for marriages. At the same time, they showed generosity by donating 3,000 kg rice for hungry souls whom they had never even met.

They families later completed the wedding rituals in the most simple fashion under the guidance of a maulvi on April 18. 

Mohsinuddin’s marriage was fixed on April 5 but the lockdown compelled them to call it off for the time being. They were anticipating normalcy in latter part of the month. 

As the Covid-19 scare continued, the families of Mohsinuddin and Nasrin decided to go ahead with the wedding but by strictly remaining within the lockdown norms.

Mohsinuddin’s younger brother Moinuddin said three main issues were decided between the families to complete the formalities. “We decided that only five people would be present from each side including the bride and the groom,” he said. He said everyone was using sanitizers, gloves and also masks during the nikaah.

Moinuddin said preparations and purchases were already made for the feast (Walima) on the day following the ‘nikaah’ but now it was not possible. “When we realized our guests would not be able to make it to our place for blessing the couple. We decided to distribute the foodgrains to the needy people and seek their good wishes instead,” he said.

Moinuddin said he had already spotted Ghulam Ashrafi and Moshu Ashrafi’s Young Force group distributing food to 1,500 people twice daily. “We decided to donate 3,000 kg rice to the group. They could prepare it and take it to the poor people whose blessings will help our family,” he said.
