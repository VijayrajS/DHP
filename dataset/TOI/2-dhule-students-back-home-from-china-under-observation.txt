NASHIK: Two students from Dhule, who had been studying in Wuhan in China, have returned to their homes on Monday.

Both these students were among the 112 evacuated by the Union government from China in the last week of February. Wuhan has emerged as the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China and was placed in a lockdown till recently.

After reaching India, the two students were quarantined at ITBP facility in Chhawla in Delhi for 14 days. None of these evacuees have tested positive for Covid-19.

Dhule civil surgeon Manik Sangale told TOI that both these two students returned to Dhule this morning from Delhi.

“Although both of them have tested negative for Covid-19, we have still put them on house quarantine for the next 14 days since they have travelled from Delhi to Dhule. We want to rule out any infection related to the virus during their domestic travel. We have asked both these students not to venture out of their homes during these 14 days,” added Sangale.

The civil surgeon said that he has advised both these students to preferably stay in one room in their homes during these 14 days.

The local health authorities would be enquiring on a daily basis about their well-being. And in case of need, the health officials would visit their homes if they complain of any health related issues.

The two students had gone to Wuhan in November last year and are studying at Wuhan University of Science and Technology.

Initially, after the outbreak of Covid-19 at Wuhan, these two students did not opt to fly back to India when the Union government had evacuated 600 Indians from there. They had decided to stay back as their studies would get hampered. But as the situation deteriorated at Wuhan and elsewhere in China, they decided to return to India.
