Ludhiana: The rising number of Covid-19 cases seem to have created a sense of fear among parents of sports trainees, as their wards have not returned to their training sessions at different coaching centres of the sports department.

Now, due to lack of trainees, the state sports department has decided to shut down most of local training centres in the district, almost 12, till further notice. 

At present, sports department is running only two to three local training centres. 

However, the sports department has given instructions to coaches to continue their regular online practice sessions for trainees to improve their sport skills until the coronavirus situation is brought under control. 

District sports officer Ravinder Singh said “Due to increase in Covid-19 cases with every passing day in the district, the parents of the trainees fear the worse and prefer not to send their children to attend the daily practice sessions. Since we understand the dilemma of the parents and their concern about the safety of their children, we are also not forcing them to attend.”

According to him, in the two last months, after the strict lockdown was enforced, sports department is providing online training sessions to their trainees. 

Aware that it is critical to stay in shape, both mentally and physically, the sports trainees are also taking these online sessions seriously by following coaches’ instructions. Rajvir Singh, a judo player, said, “We are getting trained in yoga and other exercises meant to keep a person mentally and physically fit in such circumstances.”

He said when the centres reopened, his family members were getting concerned for his safety. “They were not happy that I have to venture out from home and increase my chances of getting infected. They said no, and I had stopped going, so it is good thing that we are getting trained online,” added Rajvir.
