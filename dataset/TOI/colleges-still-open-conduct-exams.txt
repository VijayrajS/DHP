Among them was Institute of Insurance and Risk Management (IIRM) that held its semester exams. “We have to appear for the semester exams from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm. Sometimes, the institute also holds lab sessions during the afternoon. When the government has declared complete shutdown of all institutions, the IIRM management could have postponed the exams,” said a student on condition of anonymity. 

Similar scenes prevailed at Hindi Mahavidyalaya in Vidya Nagar. “Despite government orders, the management informed us that there are no holidays and we will have to appear for the internal and practicals exams,” said a student. 

A few engineering colleges, especially in the districts, are also conducting classes and students take to social media to raise their complaints. “@KTRTRS We, the students of SR Engineering College, Warangal wants to appeal to you that our college didn’t declare holidays even after the strict orders from the government,” tweeted Nikitha T, a student.
