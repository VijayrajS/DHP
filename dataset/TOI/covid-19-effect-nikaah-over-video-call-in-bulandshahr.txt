Meerut: A unique wedding was held in Bulandshahr’s Khurja town on Thursday in the presence of a cleric, a lawyer, a witness and a groom. A nikaah was completed over a video call with the bride in Gautambudh Nagar.With the wedding date fixed months before the Covid-19 outbreak, the couple and their families didn't want to delay the event and decided to go ahead even with the groom and bride kilometres apart. They respected social distancing norms, too, keeping it a simple affair and hardly calling anyone to the event.The nikaah took place with the groom holding his phone and the bride on the other end, on a video call. The cleric solemnised the wedding after a clear ‘qubool hai’ from the couple.“It was not possible to take a wedding procession to my bride's house during the nationwide lockdown. However, since the date of the wedding was already fixed, we did not want to delay it any further,” Aarif, the groom, in his twenties, said.“The nikaah was conducted as per proper rituals. The only thing different was the bride wasn't present in person.This was a unique wedding, but it also helped in keeping everyone safe and healthy,” Saajid, the cleric who performed the nikaah, said
