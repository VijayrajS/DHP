Ramgarh: The district administration on Saturday sealed a private clinic in Katia village of Ramgarh district and sent two doctors and five staff of the clinic to quarantine after it came to be known that the 75-year-old man who died of Covid-19 in Bokaro’s Gomia block on Thursday were initially attended by the doctors.

Ramgarh SP Prabhat Kumar said, “We received a tip-off that the two doctors had visited the septuagenarian at his home in Sadam village of Bokaro district after he complained of illness. Later, the man was referred to Bokaro General Hospital where he died.” He added, “The doctors did not inform us that they had visited the Covid-19 patient’s house even after news of his death arrived on Thursday.” 

Ramgarh civil surgeon Dr Neelam Chaudhary said, “After returning from his home, the doctors came in contact with five of their staff at the clinic and all the seven have been quarantined and their samples have been collected for tests.” Kumar informed that the clinic has been sealed.

An official of the district administration said an exercise of contact tracing has been initiated to identify all the people who came in touch with the two doctors. “The doctors may have to face legal action for violating the safety norms after a probe is conducted,” the official added.
