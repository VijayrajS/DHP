DEHRADUN: Quoting the dialogue of a fictional character from a popular Netflix series, Uttarakhand police on Saturday urged state residents to follow Covid-19 guidelines and stay indoors during the nationwide lockdown. 

The state police uploaded a post relating to Covid-19 lockdown on its Facebook wall along with a photo of actor Alvaro Morte, who has essayed the character of “Professor” in the popular Netflix series “Money Heist”.

 Along with his photo, state police wrote a message saying — "When someone asks you why not to go out during #lockdown… B’coz it’s a matter of our security." The line ‘B’cozit’s a matter of our security’ — is a popular dialogue in Money Heist. “This is an innovative step and it appeals to a high number of people. Such characters are especially popular among the younger generation,” said DG (law and order) Ashok Kumar. 

The senior police official added that in future too, the department would use characters which are popular to spread the message of staying at home among people.
