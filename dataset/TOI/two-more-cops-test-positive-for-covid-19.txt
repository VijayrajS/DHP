HYDERABAD: Three days after a constable succumbed to Covid-19 and a detective inspector tested positive on Thursday, two more cops from the Bowenpally and Chilkalguda police stations have contracted the deadly virus on Saturday.

A constable from Bowenpally police station, who was on duty at Gandhi Hospital between May 2 and 10, suffered from high fever recently and tested positive for the virus.

“While the constable was shifted to Gandhi Hospital, his family was asked to go under quarantine for 14 days,” a police source said. 

The Chilkalguda cop, who was shifted to the hospital, is reportedly a sub-inspector. However, officials refused to reveal the identity. 

The DI of Rachakonda, who tested positive earlier, was performing duties at the containment areas in Balapur tested positive.

Meanwhile, Hyderabad police commissioner, Anjani Kumar visited the Kulsumpura police station on Saturday afternoon to condole the death of constable Dayakar Reddy. 

He died on Wednesday due to Covid-19. The officials observed a two-minute silence as a mark of respect to the deceased. 

“The death of Dayakar Reddy, police constable officer at such a young age has hurt me so much. May his soul rest in peace. He was a hardworking officer. The department extends its support to his family,” said Anjani Kumar.

A job will be provided to his wife and an NGO would take care of the children’s education.
