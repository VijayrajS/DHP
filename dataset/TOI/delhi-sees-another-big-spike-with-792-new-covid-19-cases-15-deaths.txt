NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 crisis in Delhi turned more serious on Wednesday with the state recording 792 new cases in a single day — the highest so far. More than a dozen staff of AIIMS have also tested positive, sources said. With this, the state’s total tally has crossed the 15k mark to reach 15,257.

 
 

The previous highest spike in fresh cases in Delhi, 660, was on May 22. The city also reported 15 more Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 303.

As per the government data, of the total number of cases found positive, only 7,690 are active cases. Of this, 50% are under home quarantine. “A total of 2,118 patients are admitted in various Covid hospitals,” an official said.


50% active cases in home isolation
Most of the private hospitals that are offering Covid-19 treatment are running full.

However, most government hospitals have vacant beds, including ICUs. Lok Nayak Hospital, for example, has 2,000 beds for the novel coronavirus patients of which only 602 (30%) are occupied. Even in AIIMS Jhajjar, sources said, there are enough beds available at present in the hospital.

“Most people who have insurance coverage or those who can afford want to get admission in private hospitals. That’s why there is more rush in them,” said a senior doctor at LNJP Hospital .

Recently, the Delhi government issued orders directing private hospitals and nursing homes with more than 50 beds to reserve 20% of beds for Covid-19 patients.

However, the hospitals say mixing non-Covid patients with Covid-19 cases may cause more problems. “It will run the danger of hospital itself becoming a hub for transmitting the disease,” Dr Chander Prakash, president of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, said.

He added that the government should choose select government and private hospitals instead and make them exclusively available for Covid-19 patients.

The Delhi government is currently running two hospitals for Covid-19 treatment — Lok Nayak and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty. A 1,500-bed facility at the state-run Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in east Delhi has also been set up.

On Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Delhi government had expected a sudden rise in the number of positive cases with the announcement of more relaxations in the lockdown to restart economic activities on May 17.

According to government functionaries, there are over 3,800 beds (about 3,180 with oxygen) currently available in five government facilities — both state-run and Centre’s combined — and nearly 670 in private health facilities in the capital.
