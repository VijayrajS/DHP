Virus checks child marriages in Rajasthan
2020-04-11
AJMER: What the government could not achieve, coronavirus has! The pandemic will effectively put a brake on the child marriages taking place on Akshaya Tritiya which falls on April 26.


Hundreds of marriages were said to take place on the auspicious dates from April 15 to 25, 28 and 27 are being cancelled.

Every year, the state government along with the legal aid authority initiates an awareness programme against child marriages in the state.

According to astrologer Suresh Sharma, the Dev Uthani Ekadashi, an auspicious date for marriages, is on April 15. 

Hundreds of marriages were scheduled to take place on the day, most of which were planned six months ago.

Akshaya Tritiya is an auspicious day for marriages when there is no need for matching horoscopes. This period will end on April 27 and again be effective during May 1-19.

But people are cancelling marriages for social distancing and informing the guests.

“I had continuous bookings at my marriage garden from April 16 to May 1 but now the clients are cancelling weddings,” said Mahesh Saini. The Gujjar community in Ajmer will denounce anyone who goes for child marriages during the lockdown.

 “Generally, child marriage or any other marriage in villages are possible only amid large gatherings which are not possible during the pandemic,” said a Gujjar community leader.

Even parents do not want to marry their child in the absence of large gathering.
