PUNE: A selfie every hour or have the police at your door, except if you are resting, is how apps monitoring those in home quarantine work. Truants can be ready for mass quarantine at an institutional centre, reads a tweet by police personnel and district administration. 


After the Centre approached states for more technical solutions in the wake of the country registering over 10,000 cases on Tuesday, and over 3 lakh persons under home or institutional quarantine, state officials are pushing for wristbands and identity cards with GPS to monitor the movements of patients or persons to analyse and contain the spread of the infection and to ensure live monitoring of people in quarantine.




Maharashtra and Karnataka have a home quarantine tracking system and Kerala uses GPS. The Centre has sought proposals to also track the spread of coronavirus in real time and help urban local bodies reporting high cases.

State officials said digital tracking tools that help authorities in marking out zones, wristbands, I-cards with GPS to track the spread of the infection and movement of patients, payroll systems that can apply predefined fines to workers who violate the attendance norms have been listed.

There is also a demand for tools that can gather historical intelligence of any area, apart from AI-based face detection tools that can assist urban local bodies assist a person needing urgent help, and also set up SOS call centres.

Israel, Singapore and South Korea are using a combination of location data, video camera footage and credit card information to track Covid-19 while India is using CCTV cameras, Arogya Setu app and drone data.
