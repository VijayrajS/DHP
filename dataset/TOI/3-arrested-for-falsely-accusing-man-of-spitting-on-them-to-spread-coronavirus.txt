MEERUT: Police in UP’s Meerut have booked and arrested a local shopkeeper, his brother and his friend for allegedly trying to frame a man from minority community, hours after they got involved in a minor argument with him. According to police, the shopkeeper, Arun Kumar and the victim, Naimuddin had a fight on Sunday morning over price of bidi. A police complaint was also filed by Naimuddin after Kumar attacked him.


But, hours later, Kumar reached Kankarkhera police station and alleged that Naimuddin spitted on him and also bit him with an intention to spread novel coronavirus.

He claimed that Naimuddin “was sent from people of his community to spread coronavirus”. 

A preliminary probe on Monday spilled the beans and Kumar confessed that he was trying to frame Naimuddin.

“Kumar confessed that he got the injury inflicted on his arm to use it as evidence against Naimuddin,” a police officer said, adding that this was done to settle score.

“A fight erupted on Sunday morning at Kumar’s shop over the price of bidi. Kumar had attacked Naimuddin, who went straight to police station and got a case registered,” he said.

Ajay Sahni, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut, said, “After recent incidents, people are trying to settle old scores by spreading rumours against a community. FIR has been registered and all the three accused have been arrested.”

According to sources, several allegations, mostly false, against Tablighi Jamaat attendees have turned the situation volatile in many pockets of the region, and police are taking all precautions to quell the rumours.

Apart from Kumar, his brother Manoj Kumar and friend Tarun Gurjar, all residents of Lakhwaya village, have been arrested.
