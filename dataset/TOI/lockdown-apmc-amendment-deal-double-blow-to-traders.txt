Lockdown, APMC amendment deal double blow to traders
2020-05-30
HUBBALLI: Wholesale traders at the APMC yard in Hubballi, one of the largest market yards in Asia, are staring at a bleak future.

First, coronavirus pandemic hit their business followed by a two-month lockdown across the country and recently the Karnataka government issued an ordinance to amend the APMC Act to help farmers sell their produce outside the yard from June 1.

This has dealt a double blow to about 500 traders of onions, potatoes, foodgrains and other commodities, who have been carrying out business for generations. Abdul Wahab Mulla, secretary, Onion and Potato Traders Association, said, “Due to the lockdown we are unable to gather at one place and discuss the pros and cons of the amendment. Once the lockdown is lifted we will come together and discuss the issue,” he added.

Shankaranna Munavalli, former president Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the Act will not help farmers. “It will be very difficult for farmers to deal without a mediator. Over the decades there is a relationship between farmers and traders, all of sudden it cannot be broken. We have submitted a memorandum to the elected representatives and ministers to withdraw the amendment,” he said.

Ramesh Bafna, former APMC member and trader, said that due to the lockdown, there is lack of knowledge among traders and farmers about the new amendment. “We need to study it to understand how it impacts business. Even the officials haven’t put in any efforts to create awareness about the Act”, he said.
