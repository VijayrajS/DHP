District collector and chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority Suraj Mandhare has announced the implementation of the DMA in the district.

The actual implementation of the Act will be done by civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale as the incident commander, while district health officer Dawal Salve has been appointed as the joint controller.

Salve said, “The DMA implementation gains significance given the coronavirus scare. The district health machinery, under the instructions of the civil surgeon, can stop people from gathering at a certain place.”

“If there is a need for a hospital to admit people suspected to have caught the virus or if the health department needs a few hospital beds, the civil surgeon can instruct the hospitals concerned. Services of private doctors can also be sought,” he added.

Meanwhile, the civil surgeon would be preparing an independent medical squad to take preventive measures. Salve said they would also be spreading awareness about the virus. All primary health centres (PHC) have been instructed to put two banners on coronavirus — one at the PHC and the other at the ST bus stand.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been asked to take action against drug and medical store owners and operators if they are found selling medicines or masks at marked-up prices.
