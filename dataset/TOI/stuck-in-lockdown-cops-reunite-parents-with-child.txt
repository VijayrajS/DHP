Stuck in lockdown, cops reunite parents with child
2020-04-15
Panaji: In a joint effort, Goa police along with their Karnataka counterparts reunited a Bengaluru-based Goan couple with their four-year-old child who was in the state before the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police Shobhit Saxena said the child had arrived in Goa to stay with his grandparents at Arpora before the lockdown.

Saxena said the parents were hoping that the lockdown would end by April 14, but as there was speculation that it would be extended, the childâ€™s parents approached Goa police for help to take him back to Bengaluru.

Goa police advised the family to seek a travel permit from authorities in Karnataka to come to Goa to pick up the child, Saxena said. He also said that after obtaining the travel permit, the family approached Goa police, and with the help of an e-pass issued by the collector, the grandparents travelled to the border.

Saxena said that since the grandparents are senior citizens, it was difficult to manage themselves during the time of lockdown in the state.

The superintendent of police said that as the parents had to return to Bengaluru the same day, a time was fixed at the Keri border checkpost at Sattari to reunite the child with them.

PI Valpoi police station Shivram Vaingankar said that the minor child and his grandparents later crossed the checkpost and proceeded to Bengaluru.

The overall coordination was managed by the Goa superintendent of police and additional collector Shashank Tripathi, while the ground-level coordination at border checkpost Keri was conducted by Vaingankar, PI Ramakrishna Parab (IRB), and executive magistrate Shambhu Malvankar.
