Madhya Pradesh to increase testing with more machines
2020-05-17
BHOPAL: In a step towards systematic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all districts and increase routine testing as per current testing guidelines, the MP health department is to procure more RNA extraction machines from a South Korean manufacturer, according to sources. 


Around 16 such machines are to be supplied by the manufacturer. Two more RNA extraction facilities would be increased with the help of the Aziz Premji Foundation this month, said sources. So far, MP has 17 laboratories which are testing for Covid-19. Around 3,500 Covid-19 tests can take place in Madhya Pradesh each day, according to the Directorate of Medical Education (DME), which monitors the testing facility in these labs. 

The testing machines would be automated and can be pre-programmed.

Another set of measures is to improve testing at the district level. It can be done with TB testing facilities with high-end machines like CBNAAT. 

Also, cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) was introduced in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method for detection of TB. It also detects rifampicin resistance as it targets the rpoB gene of mycobacteria. PCR testing also determines Covid-19 presence in swab samples. 

There are also some alternatives such as the TrueNat test, which is cheaper as it has been developed in India. Guidelines for the same are expected to be released soon, according to an AIIMS official.
