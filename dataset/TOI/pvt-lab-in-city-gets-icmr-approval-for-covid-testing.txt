2020-04-22
Indore: Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved Covid-19 testing in Sampurna Sodani Diagnostic Clinic for real time PCR based testing.

MGM dean Dr Jyoti Bindal said this is the first private laboratory getting nod from ICMR for Covid-19 testing in Madhya Pradesh. The laboratory with testing capacity of 50 samples will begin operations from Friday.

ICMR in its latest list of approved laboratories has also included Chirayu Medical college lab, Bhopal.

Dr Sadhna Sodani, owner of the lab said, "ICMR has approved the lab for testing Covid-19 samples. We will begin testing soon. We had applied for approval a week ago to National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and got it within four days. Further process was completed to get the nod from ICMR.”

Dr Bindal said three CBCZ machines used for genome testing in TB patients got nod for testing Covid-19 samples. “We will get the cartridge used in the machine in a couple of days and begin testing. This test will help by reducing the testing time to around half an hour from nine to 10 hours,” she said.
