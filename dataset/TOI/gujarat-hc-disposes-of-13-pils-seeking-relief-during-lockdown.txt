Gujarat HC disposes of 13 PILs seeking relief during lockdown
2020-04-21
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has disposed of all 13 PILs which were filed for directions to the government for better management of the situation in the state during the lockdown due to Covid-19 spread, saying that it was satisfied with the state government’s efforts, and the advocates representing different petitioners also agreed with the court’s view.These PILs were seeking directions on various counts – from against compulsory mask policy to free food for all; from requirement of more testing for checking Covid-19 to intervention on three-month moratorium on loans by financial institutions; from issuance of passes for volunteers during the lockdown to supplying masks and sanitizers to inmates in jail; from release of prisoners facing less punishment and PASA detainees to directions to cops not to arrest anybody till the lockdown period ends.During last hearing on Friday, the bench headed by the Chief Justice Vikram Nath found many demands unnecessary, a few of them already fulfilled by the authorities, and it disposed of the rest of the PILs on the assurance given by the state law officers that the demands of the petitioners will be taken care of.The HC was also critical of the petitioners and their lawyers too, “The reliefs claimed in these Civil Applications and Public Interest Litigation are so many times repetitive or have been made in a reckless and irresponsible manner. In so many matters there is no foundation laid but multiple reliefs are claimed. Anything and everything that can be imagined…”The HC further said, “What happens is one or two good causes raised get eclipsed and lose their sheen and are covered by the majority of frivolous ones. The Court hopes and trusts that Counsels or parties in person would be more careful and cautious in future.”The high court has posted further hearing on its suo motu PIL on May 1, when the state government has been asked to place further action taken report in court.
