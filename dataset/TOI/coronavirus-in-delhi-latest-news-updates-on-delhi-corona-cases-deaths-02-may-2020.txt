*The number of districts termed “red zones” in Delhi has risen from nine to all 11. This means the entire city is now in the red zone, as the two districts that had the orange tag till Tuesday have been brought under the strictest colour code. Senior officials said the districts were earlier designated red, orange or green based on the cases reported and the doubling rate. North West and South West Delhi had fared better on both counts and had been kept in the orange category.

*The first Covid-19 positive patient who received plasma therapy in a Delhi government hospital has been discharged after recovery. The patient was in ICU when the therapy was administered, which showed positive results.

*Almost 9,500 barricades are being used across Delhi at police pickets and to demarcate the containment zones. If lined up end to end, these would span 6.5 kilometres. And what is more, that is still not enough. To meet the largest ever demand for the familiar yellow roadblocks, the cops have ordered 8,000 new ones.

*If the number of Covid-19 cases do not see a sudden surge, there will be a drop in the number of containment zones in the capital in the next few days. On Friday, the number of containment zones in Delhi reached 97 — housing about 5.25 lakh population — with no new addition and de-sealing of one such area in east Delhi.

*Gurugram has moved, unexpectedly for its administrators, from the red to the orange zone, which makes it eligible for resumption of certain economic activities and services like autos and app-based cabs. But other than permissions to some categories of shops and factories to reopen, officials said the curbs are likely to continue as they have been while the city has been in ‘red’.

*Delhi government is going to double the quantity of free ration — 10kg instead of the usual five — given through the public distribution system (PDS) this month.
