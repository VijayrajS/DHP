2020-03-30
Kolhapur: The chicken prices, which fell to Rs 30-40 per kg two weeks back amid rumours of the Covid-19 outbreak is now back to normalcy and in some cases even costlier. 

In wake of the coronavirus outbreak, many citizens were avoiding eating chicken and eggs, which saw a major slump in prices. The poultry industry across the state had to sell their birds at peanut price and lakhs of them were culled as the farmers were finding difficult to run the business.

Due to the country-wide shut down the chicken is now back in demand, the prices have now reached Rs 160-180 per kg and at some places even more than that. 

Sunday, which is often the non-veg relishing day for most, saw long queues outside the chicken and mutton shops, maintaining the social distancing rules.

Ramesh Gholape, meat shop owner from Kasba Bawada said, “We are still short in the supply and the price could go more than Rs 250 per kg. However, we just opened the shops and if we charge the customers more they will not buy it. Many are in their homes and their daily wages have been stopped.” 

According to business experts, the prices will be increased further. The state government through several mediums have assured people that eating chicken does not lead to infection. The shops were shut even after the lockdown announced from Monday. A couple of days back, the government allowed the transport of the birds and allowed the shops to open taking care of the lockdown rules.

Akshay Raut, a customer said, “Since lockdown, I came to buy chicken for the first time. All our doubts have been cleared. We feel sad for the poultry operators as they were the first to bear the brunt of the coronavirus fear.” 

Raut said that there is also a shortage of eggs in the market and currently eggs are sold at Rs 6 per piece.
