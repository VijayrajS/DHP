LUCKNOW: A day after a KGMU nurse working in Queen Mary’s Hospital was diagnosed with Covid-19, her 18-year-old niece, who lives with her, was also found infected with novel coronavirus.

“The niece of the nurse was shifted to the ICU unit for a few hours today to monitor her vitals, but she is stable,” said Dr D Himanshu, in-charge infectious disease unit told TOI on Tuesday.

The nurse (26) was in the team that performed emergency C-section on a pregnant woman last Thursday. 

The woman was found having Covid-19, a day after the surgery, following which the entire team was tested and when the reports arrived the nurse was found positive.

During contact tracing, the authorities came to know that the nurse’ niece was suffering from flu-like symptoms since four days and got her tested on Monday.

KGMU authorities said there is a strong possibility of the nurse contracting infection from her niece.

When asked about the possibility of nurse passing infection to the patient as none of the latter’s family members tested positive, KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said that it is highly unlikely.

“Since the incubation period of the virus is at least five days, a test will show positive result only after 3-4 days of infection. In this case, the patient was found positive two days after being admitted. If incubation period is taken into account, indications are that the patient already had infection at the time of admission,” Dr Singh said.

When asked that the nurse worked in the hospital till Sunday and if incubation period is 3-4 days, many would have been exposed to infection, Dr Singh said: “Chances of the nurse passing infection to other patients are also low because safety protocol is followed at every step. All the medical personnel have tested negative.”
