Andhra Pradesh deputy CM blames Tablighi Jamaat for Covid-19; apologises later
2020-04-12
TIRUPATI: Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister K Narayanaswamy on Saturday accused the Tablighi Jamaat of spreading coronavirus but later retracted his statement as his video blaming the principal minority community went viral on social media. Narayanaswamy’s statement comes a week after chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy appealed to people not to communalise the coronavirus issue.

“I am withdrawing my comments made earlier in the day. My intention was not to hurt the sentiments of people of any particular faith,” Narayanaswamy told TOI.

Narayanaswamy, who chaired a review meeting with excise department officials at the sub-collector’s office in Tirupati on Saturday, accused the Tablighi Jamaat of spreading the novel coronavirus by ‘‘licking spoons and plates”.

The deputy chief minister may have fallen prey to a fake video, which was widely circulated on social media, showing a group of Muslims eating leftover food from spoons and plates. The video was debunked as fake.

Stating that he was not averse to Muslims, Narayanaswamy said AP would have only a few coronavirus positive cases had the virus not spread to the state by people attending the Tablighi meeting in Delhi.

When contacted, Narayanaswamy told TOI that his only concern at a time when the state is witnessing a spike in coronavirus cases, Muslims should stay safe by adopting social distancing guidelines. “They should cooperate with the state government and strictly adhere to doctors’ advice to prevent further outbreak of the pandemic," he said. TJR Sudhakar Babu, YSRCP spokesperson, said the the meeting was accidental. "I have not seen the statement of the deputy chief minister, but there was nothing like uncleanliness to blame the participant,” he told TOI.
