AHMEDABAD: Staff gave Catherine Christian, 56, the head nurse at Civil Hospital who succumbed to Covid-19, a teary farewell on Tuesday morning.

As her mortal remains were laid in a casket, she was given a guard of honour by staff members and Home Guard personnel on duty at the campus as a ‘corona warrior’ who had served in the Covid-19 ward.

Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that Catherine, a resident of Maninagar, had joined GG Hospital in Jamnagar in 1988. “She became part of the Civil Hospital family in 1996 and ever since served patients from the city and beyond ever since. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, she was assigned to the gynaecology ward,” he said.

Her colleagues remembered her as a disciplinarian about ward cleanliness and management and a true friend to many junior nurses.

“She was given duty in Ward A-1 of the Covid-19 hospital from April 26 to May 3. She took a break for three days and then was given duty in the gynaecology ward. On May 11, she complained of symptoms and tested positive. She was then admitted to the hospital for treatment,” said a senior Civil Hospital official.
