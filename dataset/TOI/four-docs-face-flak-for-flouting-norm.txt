Four Kolkata doctors face flak for flouting coronavirus norm
2020-03-22
KOLKATA: As many as four city doctors — three from private and the other from a government hospital — have received flak from colleagues and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) for refusing to quarantine themselves on their return from abroad. Two of them — one from government and the other from a private hospital — underwent swab tests that ruled out Covid-19. The other two have not been tested till Saturday as they showed no symptoms.


While two doctors, both plastic surgeons had been to the UK, the other two — one is a radiologist and the other a gastroenterologist from the same private hospital — had returned from South America. The duo who had returned from South America had joined work immediately after their return. They decided to go for home isolation once they realised that their coming to work was creating a buzz in the hospital. 

The third doctor — a plastic surgeon at a government hospital — conducted a few surgeries before getting admitting to the isolation ward of Bankura Medical College. His swab samples have tested negative. 

The fourth one — also a plastic surgeon but at a private hospital — did not conduct any surgery but had reportedly met several people after his return. “We found the conduct of these doctors extremely irresponsible. They should have been more cautious. We condemn their act,” said an IMA official.

TOI spoke to one of the doctors soon after he got himself tested. I got myself admitted in the hospital after I developed sore throat. Before that I had kept myself at home,” he said. He was discharged from hospital upon testing negative.
