City could cut Covid-19 cases 56% by keeping red light areas shut
2020-05-20
Nagpur: A national-level study done by academicians from Yale School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School has highlighted that Nagpur can delay peak of Covid-19 cases by up to 30 days if the authorities kept the red light area (RLA) in city closed even post lockdown. It says Covid-19 cases could be reduced up to 56% this way.

A study ‘Modelling the Effect of Continued Closure of Red Light Areas on Covid-19 Transmission in India’ was completed recently. It highlights impact of red light areas in five cities – Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Kolkata — which are currently in the red zone and account for some of the largest red light areas in the country with large numbers of sex workers.

As per the study, if red light areas are kept closed even after lockdown ends, there can be a delay in the peak of Covid-19 cases by up to 12 days in Mumbai, 17 days in New Delhi, 29 days in Pune, 30 days in Nagpur, and 36 days in Kolkata.

Delay in the peak will provide the government more time and opportunities to plan and execute measures to protect public health and economy, as India moves in Lockdown 4.0. The study also states that there could be a 63% reduction in the number of deaths in the first 60 days after the lockdown ends, if red light areas are kept closed.

Co-author of the report, Dr Sudhakar Nuti from the Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said any effort in delaying peak reduces amount of stress on medical system.

“The continued closure of red light areas would build on the successes achieved by the government in lockdown. India gained around 40 days of delay in the peak through lockdown and can gain another 17 days delay by keeping these places closed,” he said. 

Commenting on the limitations of the study, co-author, Dr Jefferey Townsend, said the actual scenario will depend on behaviour of individuals and the study model does not predict how individuals will behave.

“The purpose of our modelling exercises in not to predict what will happen, but to understand the effect of the intervention on the future. Our study findings show there is a strong effect of the red light area closures, especially immediately following the lockdown,” he said.

What the study is all about

* Done in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Kolkata 

* 6,37,500 sex workers in India

* Over 5 lakh customers visit the red-light areas daily 

* If red-light areas start operating, disease will spread extremely quickly

* High transmission rate is because social distancing is not possible during the sex act

* Infected customers could spread disease to lakhs of others

* To protect citizens against this, the study recommends keeping red light areas closed indefinitely, during the Covid-19 pandemic
