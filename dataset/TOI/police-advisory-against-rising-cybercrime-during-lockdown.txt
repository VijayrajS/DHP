Police advisory against rising cybercrime during lockdown
2020-04-12
Ranchi: Police issued an advisory to people of the state, asking them to remain alert against cybercrime which has seen a rise during the lockdown period. 

On Friday, two men were arrested for allegedly siphoning off Rs 53 lakh by duping several people through a fake website of the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund to fight novel coronavirus.

In another case, senior lawyer from the city, Milan Kumar Dey, received a call from his bank asking him if he had done any transaction in the recent past. When he replied in the negative, the bank official asked him to block his card immediately as someone was trying to misuse it. Dey has informed the cyber cell about the illegal transaction attempt.

A few days ago, a Kokar resident got a call, informing him that he has won Rs 25 lakh and the caller asked him if he wanted to encash it. Sandip Kalia, a former bank employee, said that one should never pay heed to such messages because banks usually call the customers to office to carry out any important transactions. 

IG Navin Kumar said, “The cyber cell had warned people, in general, that criminals may create fake websites related to Covid-19 and get access to personal details of the public in the name of giving them information regarding the disease. Police have also warned the people, saying they should not transfer money, meant for helping the government in its fight against coronavirus, to any unverified accounts published in social media.”

Police have also cautioned people not to open any unverified links on social media to gather information on Covid-19. They further said people must avoid downloading apps like ‘Corona Infection Tracker’ and ‘Corona Live’ since such apps could lead hackers gaining access to their personal information.
