Nagpur: A 50-year-old woman from Yavatmal tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, though she had tested negative on March 13, taking the total number of positive cases in Vidarbha to 7. This woman is from the group of 40 people that had been to Dubai between February 24 and March 2. Her latest samples were sent to IGGMCH Nagpur on Saturday evening.Yavatmal district collector M Devendra Singh confirmed this. “On Saturday, we had sent two swab samples. One of them was of this woman, who earlier had been tested negative. Now, she has been found positive. Another sample was a fresh case having Dubai travel history, which was found negative,” he said while adding that the isolation ward of Yavatmal GMCH now has three positive patients.This is arguably the first case in India where a suspect earlier tested negative but developed symptoms and then tested positive. This proves that novel coronavirus symptoms can develop anytime within 14 days of infection and hence the quarantine period is necessary.Apart from this positive case in Yavatmal, no new positive case was reported on Monday in Vidarbha. Samples of 12 female and 1 male suspect were sent for testing. All 13 of them were admitted to the isolation ward. Results of all 13 cases along with 5 samples submitted on Sunday are still awaited.“Out of the 13 suspects admitted on Monday, one has travel history to Nepal and another has come back from Russia. Rest 11 are close contacts of the positive patients already admitted in GMCH,” said a senior official.With 13 suspects admitted on Monday, and five suspects awaiting results from Sunday evening, Yavatmal GMCH Isolation ward now has total 18 patients, apart from three positive patients. Doctors treating these patients said they are stable and asymptomatic. Doctors are observing their general health parameters on regular basis.Meanwhile, Nagpur municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe informed that the quarantine facility in the MLA Hostel is ready. “Apart from seven high risk nations notified by Government of India, the state government has decided to keep travellers coming from USA, Saudi Arabia and Dubai in the quarantine facility under observation for 24 hours,” he said.The state has added these three nations to the list of China, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran, and South Korea, because three positive patients found in Nagpur had travel history of USA and three positive patients admitted in Yavatmal have travel history of Dubai. Many suspects are coming from Saudi too.Four suspects admitted in isolation ward of Chandrapur GMCH have also tested negative. “Health department here has so far tested a total of 33 people, including 16 having history of foreign travel and all of them have tested negative,” said guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who also handles disaster management ministry in the state.
