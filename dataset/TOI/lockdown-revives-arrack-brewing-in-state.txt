Lockdown revives arrack brewing in state
2020-04-10
Thiruvananthapuram: With all outlets of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) shut because of the lockdown and the inflow of ganja and other drugs also adversely affected due to the sealed borders, tipplers are returning to traditional method of manufacturing arrack, figures show. 

According to the figures of the excise department, the quantity of wash, which is the base for manufacturing arrack that is being confiscated from various parts of the state since March 24, the day when the lockdown began, till April 6, has steadily increased from 160 litres per day to 6,000 litres per day. The number of Abkari cases has also increased from 10 per day to 51 per day. 

The excise officials seized and destroyed 42,593 litres of wash in two weeks, which is more than double the quantity of wash being seized and destroyed on an average every month. 

Interestingly, the number of cases under narcotic and psychotropic substances act (NDPS) and the corresponding increase in confiscation of contrabands coming under the NDPS including ganja has been very less. The seizure of ganja since March 24 has only been in the range of few grams per day, except for a seizure of 10 kg on the second day of lockdown. 

Also, the manufacturing of spurious IMFL also was as good as nil in the two weeks. Except on April 2 when just two litres of spirit was seized from Thrissur, there was no case of seizure of spirit used for the manufacture of IMFL. 

Excise department officials said that the main reason behind this is the curtailed movement of vehicles, because of which the ‘traditional’ method of manufacturing is making a comeback. “It is being observed that the illicit brewing is on the rise and the excise department is focusing on this aspect. We are relying also on the data of those areas that has been traditionally under radar for illicit brewing as well as individuals who were earlier involved in illicit brewing of liquor,” excise commissioner S Aananthakrishnan said.

As per the figures, Kozhikode, Kollam, Idukki, Alappuzha, Kannur and Thrissur are some of the districts where large quantity of wash was seized and destroyed from. 

Excise department sources said that many who had earlier implicated in arrack manufacturing cases are making a comeback using the situation. Also, the manufacturing of wash is comparatively an easy process, with all the resources available at the houses itself. “Yeast and jiggery are the basic ingredients and it is also being observed that jackfruits are also being added to this since it is the season of jackfruits now. The fermentation takes at least seven to 10 days, and some use chemicals from torch batteries to increase the speed of fermentation,” excise department sources added. 

The state had completely banned brewing of arrack in 1996, and the vacuum created after banning arrack was slowly replaced by IMFL through Bevco outlets.
