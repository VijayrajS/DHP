2020-06-14
HYDERABAD: Even as nine district area hospitals are getting ready to treat Covid-19 patients, lack of medical staff is a concern for the authorities. Sources said hospitals faced 50% to 60% doctor shortage, which could affect Covid-19 treatment. 


While Nizamabad Government Hospital is almost ready, RIMS in Adilabad, MGM Hospital in Warangal and district area hospitals in Karimnagar, Nalgonda, Mahbubnagar, Siddipet, Khammam and Suryapet have been designated to offer Covid-19 treatment.

Nizamabad hospital has the highest allotment for Covid-19 patients with 200 beds. “For 304 doctor posts, only 104 are working,” rued a senior doctor. In RIMS, nine patients are being treated. The hospital has 100 beds for Covid-19 cases, but has only five senior medical officers on Covid-19 duty. “They have to attend other duties also,” sources said. 

Officials said apart from offering treatment, these hospitals would do Covid-19 tests.

Khammam GGH has 100 beds exclusively to treat Covid-19 patients, but the hospital is facing 50% shortage of staff, including doctors. It has eight ventilators. In MGM Hospital, 10 coronavirus patients are undergoing treatment. It has 200 beds for Covid-19 patients. For 1,420 medical officer posts, only 870 are working. Nalgonda GGH has 25 beds and another 10 ICU beds to treat Covid patients, sources said.

In the hospitals in Suryapet and Siddipet, which were part of common districts earlier, the staff are yet to be allotted fully. Mahbubnagar government hospital has two Covid-19 patients. For 111 doctor posts, only 26 are working in the hospital.

However, these government hospitals will take care of only level 1 and level 2 patients who do not require ventilator support and are not in a very serious condition. “Such patients will be sent to Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad. In all the hospitals, the isolation wards have been converted into Covid-19 wards,” an official said.
