IMA writes to state govt, pushes for testing drivers, transport staff for virus
2020-05-15
Panaji: In view of fresh Covid-19 cases detected in Goa, including a lorry driver from Gujarat, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, has demanded that all goods carrier drivers and accompanying workers be tested for Covid-19.

“They should be tested by a nasopharyngeal swab irrespective of whether they have any upper respiratory symptoms or fever,” said IMA president Dr S Samuel in a statement. Authorities should ask them to limit their movement until their test results are known. It will help the state achieve proper containment of the Covid-19 pandemic, even if a person tests positive for the virus, the statement said.

The guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) exempting drivers and accompanying staff transporting essential supplies from being tesed, the IMA said, was meant for the smooth flow of supply chains. 

Subjecting them to the tests will not hinder the transport of goods, said the statement. “ It is to keep our Goa safe by fast containment,” said Samuel. tnn
