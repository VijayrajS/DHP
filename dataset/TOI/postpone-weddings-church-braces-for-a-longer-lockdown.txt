‘Postpone weddings’: Church braces for a longer lockdown
2020-04-03
PANAJI: Marriages and baptisms scheduled for after Easter Sunday may have to be postponed if the lockdown continues. Forseeing that the country might be compelled to extend the 21-day lockdown beyond Easter Tuesday, April 14, Archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias has advised devotees to refrain from scheduling baptism, first holy communion and marriage celebrations immediately after that date.


“Please do not schedule any baptisms, first communions and marriages immediately after April 14. It would not be prudent to so do,” Gracias stated in his latest address.

Should the lockdown be extended, this directive will hold good for Goa too.

“We have to respect and cooperate fully with civic authorities. If there is a total lockdown, there will be no marriages and baptisms. If there is a partial lockdown, we shall have to see if the celebrations can be done with the minimal number of persons needed,” a priest from the archbishop’s palace told TOI.

Marriages are not solemnised during the 40-day lenten season, which ends on Easter Sunday. This year, it falls on April 12.

As for funerals, Gracias said the municipal commissioner of Mumbai has ordered that bodies of all coronavirus victims must be cremated and mourners restricted to just five.

In Goa, too, the guidelines of the archbishop state that a minimal number of persons - the priest and very close family members - be present for the funeral rites. The same must be conducted directly at the cemetery, without any funeral mass. Children below 12 years, people above 60 years and those with medical conditions have been strongly discouraged from attending funerals.

The church in Goa has also advised against physical touch while sympathizing with the bereaved family. Priests have been instructed not to visit the house of the deceased to escort the body to the cemetery.
