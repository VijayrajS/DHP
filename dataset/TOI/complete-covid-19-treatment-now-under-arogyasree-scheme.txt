VIJAYAWADA: The state government has ordered the health department to include all 15 procedures being used to treat Covid-19 patients under the YSR Arogyasree scheme.

Covid-19 had already been brought into the ambit of the Arogyasree scheme earlier. However, upon receiving a proposal from Arogyasree CEO Mallikarjuna Annam, the government has announced that all 15 new procedures recommended by government pulmonologists that are being used for the treatment of Covid-19 will now come under the purview of the scheme.

The office of the special chief secretary on Monday issued a government order (GO) in this regard ensuring coverage under the scheme for both suspected cases as well as those who have tested positive.

“Hospitals should treat suspected and confirmed positive stable or unstable cases under the said procedures on request made by the local health authorities or under intimation to the local health authorities duly following the safety, precautionary measures while treating such patients,” the GO states. The order informs that modifications in treatment guidelines and packages will be issued periodically.

The GO further instructs the use of all isolated rooms, wards, blocks in all private hospitals for the treatment of suspected Covid-19 cases.

Moreover, the government, through its order, delegated to the CEO of the scheme to ensure that hospitals adhere to guidelines issued by the government as well as the Arogyasree trust.
