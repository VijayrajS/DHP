GBRC signs MoU for Covid-19 vaccine, diagnostics
2020-05-01
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) working under Department of Science and Technology, government of Gujarat, on Thursday signed three MoUs with state-based pharmaceutical research and development companies for the development of vaccine and diagnostics for Covid-19.

The ceremony took place in the presence of Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani. GBRC director C G Joshi was unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts through calls and SMS. 

Sources close to the development said that the research would be based on the existing genome sequencing of the Covid-19 found in Gujarat. 

It will also take into account the future attempts where plans are afoot to analyse 100-odd samples from different parts of the state taken from the patients including asymptomatic, severely affected and deceased.

The GBRC had recently claimed that the strain it found during sequencing was L-type which was similar to the one found in Wuhan, China. tnn
