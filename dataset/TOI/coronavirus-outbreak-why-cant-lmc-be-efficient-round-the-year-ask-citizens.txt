Coronavirus outbreak: Why can't LMC be efficient round the year, ask citizens
2020-03-22
LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Municipal Corporation's efficiency while sanitising the entire city on Saturday in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak took many residents by surprise. The agency even managed to address the complaints received by its control room in a matter of few hours, making residents wonder what was stopping LMC from maintaining cleanliness and hygiene on regular days.


An army of about 100 sanitation workers wearing new saffron uniforms, complete with masks and head gear, was spotted sweeping and disinfecting streets since early morning. 

While trucks collected garbage from localities with clockwork precision, over 500 workers were deployed to clean drains and conduct fogging. All 142 sanitation- related complaints received by the control room in two days were resolved within hours. Impressed by the municipal agency's work, residents couldn't help questioning why LMC wasn't as efficient throughout the year. 

"I registered a complaint about choked drains in my locality and the problem was fixed within two hours. I think LMC needs some kind of virus to spread across city for doing their job efficiently," said Komal Saxena, a resident of Alambagh. 

Shivani Mehra, who lives in Niralanagar, said, "We will be happier to pay our taxes, if we receive such service from the civic body throughout the year. However, we see such cleanliness only when a VVIP visits ours locality or a big event is being organised."

Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said 16 teams were constituted for sanitising and cleaning streets. "Two teams were deployed in each of the eight zones under LMC. The mega sanitisation exercise will continue on Sunday as well," he added.
