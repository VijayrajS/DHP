With 4 cases, Jalore getsvirus scare from migrants
2020-05-07
JODHPUR: After being in the green zone status for long since the outbreak of Covid-19, Jalore reported four cases on Wednesday. Three of the infected had come to Jalore from Gujarat’s Surat, while the fourth, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), came here after she was transferred from Sikar district two days ago.

According to an official, two of the three locals — one male and one female — belong to Virana village in Sayla subdivision while the third is from Raithal village in Ahor. The three are migrant workers and had come from Surat district, a corona hotspot.

“Besides, an ANM, who was transferred to Jalore from Sikar district two days ago, also tested positive. She had not been given charge as a precaution,” said the official.

With this alarming development, the threat of a spurt in cases looms large in Jalore, which received a large number of migrants from other states, including corona hotspots.

Swinging into action, the district administration has taken containment measures in concerned areas and started tracing contact history of all the positive cases.

It may be noted that Jalore and Sirohi, the two southern districts of Rajasthan, had continued to maintain a zero positive case status since the outbreak.

But with Jalore reporting positive cases, all eyes are on Sirohi, which turned into a major transit point for migrant workers and received a large number of them from Gujarat and other southern districts.

Given the massive influx of migrants, the administration of both the districts will have to ramp up screening as well as sample collection of suspects.

Besides this, they have to ensure keeping these migrants in home quarantine. This will be challenging for both district administrations, especially in the wake of consistent reports of violation of rules by migrants.
