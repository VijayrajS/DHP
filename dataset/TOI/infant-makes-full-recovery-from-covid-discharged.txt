PUDUKOTTAI: An 18-month-old infant recovered from Covid-19 at the Government Ranees Hospital and was discharged on Thursday. The doctors also ensured that the child’s mother, who was staying with him, did not get infected. 


Pudukottai collector P Uma Maheswari gave the send off in person by giving the child dolls in the presence of medical staff on Thursday. Working as construction labourers in Maharashtra, the parents and baby returned to Manthakollai village in Pudukkottai district on May 18. All the three were tested on May 20. While the parents tested negative, the baby was positive. The child was having difficulty in breathing and was admitted in the ICU of Government Ranees Hospital. The medical team, including medicine chief Dr C Babu Anand, paediatricians Dr S V Inkarsal and Dr S Vairamani, examined the child and found heavy breathing due to lung infection and lowering oxygen saturation levels.The doctors said that the child required respiratory support, but as there were chances that it would worsen the condition, they chose high-flow oxygen therapy in which oxygen was given at a high-flow to fill up the lungs to improve oxygen saturation. The child was given anti-viral drugs and immune boosters and shifted out of ICU after 2 days. He tested negative on Wednesday. Government medical college dean Dr A L Meenakshi Sundaram said it was crucial to have the mother close to the child and prevent her from getting infected. “The child was too young to manage on his own. Therefore, we ensured that the mother stayed with the child with personal protective equipment, N-95 mask and gloves, he said.
