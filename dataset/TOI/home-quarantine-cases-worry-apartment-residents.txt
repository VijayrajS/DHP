Home quarantine cases worry apartment residents in Kochi
2020-06-12
KOCHI: As non-resident Keralites return to their apartments in the city, many people residing in apartment complexes are not keen about having them around due to the fear of Covid-19 spread. Many individuals who have settled abroad or outside the state have bought flats in the city, and a good number of them have provided it for rent. There is a section of others who have chosen to keep their flats for themselves and opt to live there when they come here for holidays. 


“Apartment owners’ associations generally are not in favour of home quarantine in apartment complexes. It is mainly because there are too many people using common areas like lifts and lobbies. While it is possible for associations to block the entry of new tenants and visitors, they cannot prevent owners from entering their homes,” said All Kerala Apartment Owners Apex Association president V K Shankarankutty. 

The returnees are not always welcome. Friends, neighbours and even families often try to maintain a safe distance. Wife of a returnee said: “My husband had to come back as his mother passed away. Recently I underwent a surgery and I am not in a position to climb upstairs and keep that part of the house clean or get the air-conditioner repaired. There are no maids or any help available. So, I insisted that my husband should opt for a paid facility, preferably a hotel. I understand how difficult it would be for him.” 

Though everyone speaks of living with Covid-19, no one seems to be sure how to work it out. Shutting off people appears to be the easiest way, though it cannot be recommended. With the fear factor gripping people, they are trying to take every precaution to prevent themselves from getting infected. “At times it leads to a face-off. Then apartment owners’ associations interfere and try to convince both parties. It needs patience and understanding from all affected persons,” said Raju T M, a city resident.
