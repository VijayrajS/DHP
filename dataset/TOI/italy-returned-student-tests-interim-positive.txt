The swab samples of the suspected Covid-19 patient who landed from Italy via Chennai were sent to Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at SVIMS in Tirupati and NIV Pune.

While the test in Tirupati was positive, officials are waiting for confirmation from Pune as it is better equipped to diagnose viral infections.

During screening at Chennai airport, the student tested negative for high temperature. He later developed symptoms leading to his isolation at government general hospital in Nellore on Monday night. He was earlier in home isolation for three days.

Officials and the GGH have been alerted to take additional care. Sources said that on average, three to five samples are sent to VRDL at SVIMS daily for past one week.
