Covid-19: Fewer breach home quarantine in Thane, thanks to e-surveillance
2020-04-06
THANE: The e-surveillance system set up by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to keep tabs on those under quarantine seems to be paying off as the initial analysis presented on Thursday showed a lesser number of residents breaching restrictions.


A civic official revealed that barely eight of the around 550 people were seen breaching the limits set by the administration on Wednesday. Officials said this was encouraging and that the digital surveillance was probably having an effect, especially after the reports of home-quarantined people stepping outside in the past few days.

It may be noted the mobile app 'Coviguard' was flagged off in the city this week to keep a tab on those in home-quarantine. Officials also said that the system had limitations and may not give accurate information if the gadget is left at home while the person moves outside.
