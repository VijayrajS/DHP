Flyers to be quarantined for 14 days, not 7: Mumbai International Airport
2020-05-27
MUMBAI: Miscommunication between the government and airport officials saw flyers arriving in Mumbai on Monday and Tuesday get their wrists stamped for home quarantine for only seven days, instead of the mandated 14 days.

On Tuesday evening, Mumbai International Airport (MIAL) issued a statement to clarify that passengers would have to be quarantined for 14 days and not seven as stated earlier. 

MIAL, in a press statement released on Monday, had said the passengers would have to be quarantined for seven days. 

When contacted, additional municipal commissioner in charge of projects P Velrasu said, “This is wrong. It (the quarantine period) will be 14 days for domestic passengers. ” International passengers would be sent on institutional quarantine for seven days and isolated for seven more days at home. 

Velrasu also said he had instructed Mumbai airport, which said it would withdraw the incorrect press release. He added their medical team said they were stamping wrists for a 14-day quarantine period only at the domestic airport. 

When asked how the BMC will now correct the stamping done for seven days, a civic official said the flyers have downloaded the Aarogya Setu mobile application and they would be tracked to find out if they home quarantine themselves for a 14- day period.
