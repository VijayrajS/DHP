Masks, PPE kits must for cops on Covid duty in Delhi
2020-04-28
NEW DELHI: In the wake of the rise in number of cases of first responders getting infected by Covid-19, police commissioner S N Shrivastava interacted with all the 200 station house officers (SHOs) of Delhi through videoconferencing and asked them to take precautions while entering hospitals and containment zones.

The commissioner has asked the frontline soldiers to mandatorily wear PPE kits and full face masks while on Covid-19 duty. They have also been asked to take precautions to ensure that they do not pass on the infection to their family members.

“The SHOs will ensure that police stations where the frontline staff members return after their duty are kept clean. Each police station should have a wash basin and sanitisers kept outside the gates so that the cops can wash their hands before entering the station. A temperature gun should be there at every station to monitor the health of the personnel returning from the active duty,” Shrivastava said.

Policemen who are on self-quarantine have been advised to increase their immunity through yoga and by using turmeric, garlic and tulsi.

Now, the cops deployed at hospitals and containment zones will not return to the police station after finishing their Covid-19 duties, but stay at a separate facility.

The top cop has suggested optimal resource deployment at the pickets. Keep an eye on Tablighi patients admitted in hospitals from a safe distance, he told the officers.

The police officers have also been asked to come up with innovative ideas that can ensure safety of the frontline staff.
