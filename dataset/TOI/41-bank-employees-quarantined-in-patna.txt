PATNA: The Patna district administration on Saturday sent 41 employees of a PSU bank situated at Dak Bungalow roundabout to quarantine centres a day after one of the bank employees was tested positive for coronavirus.

Patna DM Kumar Ravi said apart from the 41 bank employees, five currency chest managers of other banks had also been sent to quarantine centres as a precautionary measure. He said the infection of the senior manager of the PSU bank was linked to the contact chain of currency handling firm whose four employees have so far been tested positive for coronavirus.

“Samples of all these employees were collected for Covid-19 test on Saturday. Their reports would come by Sunday,” the DM said.

He added that the functioning of the bank branch from Monday would depend on several factors, including the outcome of the test reports of quarantined employees. “Even if their test results come negative, they will be sent to 14-day home quarantine,” Ravi said.

The DM said the residents of the apartment in which the Covid-19 positive bank employee lived have been home quarantined and asked to immediately inform the administration if the symptoms develop in them. “The building in which the bank branch in situated has been sealed,” he added.
