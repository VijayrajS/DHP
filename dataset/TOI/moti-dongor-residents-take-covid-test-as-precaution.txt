MARGAO: A large number of people from Moti Dongor slum in Margao lined up at the South Goa district hospital, Margao, after the South Goa district administration directed them to undertake the covid test as a matter of abundant precaution. 

“It’s a precautionary measure. There’s no need to panic,” a senior administrative official said. 

A family of six from Moti Dongor was earlier this week tested for the virus after it was learnt that they had come in contact with their relatives in Mangor Hill, Vasco, who had tested positive. However, their tests came negative. 

Many residents of Moti Dongor work as maids and drivers in many parts of Margao, while several fruits and vegetable vendors in Gandhi market, Margao, also stay in Moti Dongor. As panic gripped the residents, sources said that maids were asked not to report for work in Margao. 

A large number of employees of Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) working at the Margao depot also undertook covid tests on Thursday after a welder, a resident of Mangor hill, working in the mechanical department, tested positive on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Margao MLA Digambar Kamat said that one resident of Margao working in the health services at Vasco tested positive and admitted in the covid hospital.
