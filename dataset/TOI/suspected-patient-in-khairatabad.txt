2020-03-24
HYDERABAD: A person suspected to have been infected with Covid-19 was taken away in an ambulance from Anandnagar Colony in Khairatabad on Monday. Locals said the person may have arrived in the city from Singapore last week. 


With city residents becoming more vigilant to any news about the outbreak, a few incidents of locals breaking quarantine norms are also being reported. A source said that a person who returned from London about five to six days ago did not abide by mandatory 14-day isolation rule. “The person didn’t get screened as the family has connections with someone influential. In fact, the watchman at their house apparently told the health officer that no such person lives in that house,” said the source who lives in Jubilee Hills. tnn
