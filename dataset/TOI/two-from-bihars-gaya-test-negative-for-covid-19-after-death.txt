2020-04-23
GAYA: Two migrant workers, who had recently died and were Covid-19 suspects, subsequently tested negative. 


Whereas one migrant worker, a resident of Barachatti block area of the district died at ANMMCH a few days back, the other migrant worker died in Varanasi and his body was brought to his village home in Mohanpur block area of the district. Besides cremation as per Covid-19 protocol, swab samples were also collected from the bodies and sent for lab test.

District magistrate Abhishek Singh also said that both the migrant workers tested negative. With these two posthumous negative cases, the total number of persons cremated as per Covid protocol and subsequently testing negative has gone up to five. Earlier, the driver of the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee, a young IITian and a woman from Asansol died of breathing problems and as such they were given a safe cremation.

The district administration has heaved a sigh of relief after test reports came negative. “Had any of them tested positive, tracing their contacts and declaring the areas as containment zones would have put additional burden on an otherwise overworked machinery,” said a district official.

Meanwhile, allaying apprehensions of shortage of PPE kits, the DM said that enough kits were available with the local distributors and more such kits would be procured in case of need.

According to an official press release, as on April 20, 136 kits were available with the authorised distributor. Several private practitioners have also got PPE gifts. Private practitioners have got about 100 kits in the last few days. Moreover, PPE kits were needed only for doctors and paramedical staff directly engaged in dealing with suspects.
