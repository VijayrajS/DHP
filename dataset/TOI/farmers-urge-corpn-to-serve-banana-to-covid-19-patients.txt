TRICHY: The banana farmers have appealed to the district administration to purchase bananas in bulk after fixing a reasonable price as it can be used to serve the patients, who are being treated in isolation wards for Covid-19 in government hospitals. Farmers added that this would help them get back the money they spent to raise the plantation.


Following the ongoing lockdown imposed due to the spread of coronavirus, farmers, particularly banana cultivators, have been worst affected. Nendran banana farmers could not transport their produce to various places and farmers, who cultivated Poovan, Rasthali and Elarisi varieties, could not sell their produce at the local market as many vegetable markets have remained closed due to the lockdown.

So, the price of each bunch has come down drastically, state organizer of farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress (TMC), Puliyur A Nagarajan said.

"I have appealed to the district authorities to procure banana prodcue from small farmers after fixing Rs 20 as price per kg for Poovan and Green banana variety. This can be served to Covid-19 positive patients, who are being treated at the hospitals. This move would help farmers who are in a distress to some extent,” Nagarajan said.

He also said that they have handed over a memorandum to the district officials as well as the city corporation commissioner C Sivasubramanian.

Meanwhile, the members of farmers’ wing of TMC headed by Nagarajan, donated bananas worth Rs 75,000 to serve the Covid-19 frontline workers particularly the conservancy workers. They handed over a truck full of bananas to Sivasubramanian at the corporation office on Thursday.
