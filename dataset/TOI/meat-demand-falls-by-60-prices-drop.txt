Coronavirus scare in Ahmedabad: Meat demand falls by 60 per cent, prices drop
2020-03-10
AHMEDABAD: Meat eaters seem to be refraining of late, as meat sales have fallen by 60% in the past one month across Ahmedabad. According to estimates by meat wholesalers in Ahmedabad, against the 100 tonnes of meat sold every day in the city earlier, sales have fallen to 40 tonnes a day. Traders attribute the decline to rumours linked to the coronavirus outbreak.


“We used to sell 100kg of meat such chicken, lamb and fish every day. Demand has fallen in the past one month, since the COVID-19 outbreak has been reported. While the government advisory only states that meat should be cooked properly, there are rumours being spread about meat consumption. People are thus getting hesitant to buying and eat meat,” said Mohammad Ali Ahmed, owner of a meat wholesale store.

Meat prices have fallen from Rs 160 a kg to Rs 100 in three weeks, poultry dealers say, adding that several hotels that earlier served meat have stopped procurement.

“We have taken all the items that include uncooked meat or cold cuts off the menu, due to the health advisory issued by the government. Procurement is done from verified sources and what is not readily available is not being served temporarily, due to health concerns,” said a city hotelier, on condition of anonymity.

Some hotels have boosted food hygiene measures in meat procurement. “There has been no significant impact on non-vegetarian food consumption at hotels. We have ensured that we procure our meat locally and double check for hygiene and quality in the interest of our guests’ health,” said another hotelier.
