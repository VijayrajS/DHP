Pump testing lab to get a facelift
2020-02-06
COIMBATORE: The oldest pump testing laboratory in the region, on the campus of the Branch MSME Development Institute at Ram Nagar here, is all set to get a makeover soon.


The ministry of MSME has sanctioned Rs 1.08 crore to renovate the laboratory infrastructure.

The facility was opened as an extension centre in 1959 along with an electric motor testing laboratory. In 1979, it was upgraded to a development institute, where pumps were tested. The lab is now accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories and recognised by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

The renovation work is in progress and Rs 2lakh for the initial work and Rs 85,000 for shifting cables was released, said branch head of the institute R Vijayakumar. “The work has been taken up by the central public works department (CPWD),” he said. The institute has two separate facilities one to test motors and another to test pumpsets, mainly agricultural pumpsets. “BIS collects random samples from manufacturers and give them to us for testing to find whether they comply with the norms and standards. We test them and provide the results to BIS,” Vijayakumar said.

The lab has a capacity to test up to 20HP pumps. It can test two samples per day. 

Among others, the lab has equipment such as volumetric tank for tracking discharge, voltmeter and ammeter to test voltage and current the pumps work at and flowmeter. “We calibrate the equipment every year by taking them to the Fluid Control Research Institute at Kanjikode in Kerala. We have also submitted a proposal to modernise the labs,” the official said. 

While the motor testing lab can test all kinds of motors, the pump testing lab can test agricultural pumps, submersible pumps and centrifugal pumps. 

The city has another pump testing lab at the Scientific and Industrial Testing and Research Centre (SiTarc) at Avarampalayam.
