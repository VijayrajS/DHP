Suspicion of coronavirus mars man’s last goodbye to wife
2020-05-07
Vijayawada: For 36-year-old Sheikh Abubakar, who is a postman, the next three days are of prime importance as they would determine whether he will get a chance to pay his last respects to his wife Syedabi (33).

Syedabi, who suffered from Pemphigus Vulgaris, a rare skin disease, for the past two years, died on Tuesday midnight after complaining of breathlessness at their residence near Benz Circle. Later on Wednesday morning, medical staff reached their residence and shifted her body to Vijayawada GGH mortuary to verify if she had coronavirus.

 Abubakar waited at the mortuary from 9 am till noon, only to learn that the test results would arrive after three days and till then the body would be in the hospital’s possession. 

A harried Abubakar told TOI, “If the test result is postive, they said we won’t get the body and if it is negative, we would receive it and only then would we be allowed to conduct her last rites.” 

Syedabi was initially responding to treatment at a private hospital. However, due to the lockdown and financial constraints, they had to discharge her and continue treatment at home. “After the lockdown, the supply of medicines stopped and we couldn’t continue the full course. Her condition deteriorated and later she passed away. She had no contact with the outside world for several months I do not know how she can have coronavirus,” he said.

As per central and state guidelines on disposal of bodies, if Syedabi were to test positive, the dead body should be sterilised and sealed before disposal as per the protocol. While only a few relatives are allowed to pay their last respects, the final rites have to be conducted by the burial ground staff. Moreover, all primary contacts of Syedabi will be quarantined.
