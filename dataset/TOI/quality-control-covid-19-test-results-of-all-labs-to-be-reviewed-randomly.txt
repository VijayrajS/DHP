Quality control: Covid-19 test results of all labs in Tamil Nadu to be reviewed randomly
2020-06-08
CHENNAI: In an attempt to make all government-approved Covid-19 testing labs accountable, Tamil Nadu, in a first in the country, has launched a testing quality assurance programme. The test review exercise will happen once in every 14 days.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has so far approved 76 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) labs in the state to test Covid-19 samples, according to official data. This included 44 government and 32 private labs.

To ensure that lab results were accurate, the state government has come out with a move to cross-check the results. The plan mandates all ICMR-designated Covid-19 testing labs to randomly choose 10 samples — five that tested positive and five negative. The samples must be sent to King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, without disclosing the results. 

The King institute will process the samples again and mail the results to the state department of public health (DPH). 

The DPH will compare results from the individual labs and the institute for disparities.

“If the results are different, the labs will be critically reviewed and surprise inspections will be conducted to ensure there was no compromise with testing and results,” said a senior official from the DPH. King Institute will be reviewed by the National Institute of Virology in Pune, according to a government order issued by state health secretary Beela Rajesh on June 3.

The first round of samples (collected from May 15 to 31) will be reviewed at King Institute from June 10.

Some private labs have, however, expressed concern about the review move, highlighting that the government itself has, on several occasions, accepted that the virus was tricky and test results were not consistent.

When asked about the concern, the DPH official said if samples were collected and tested properly as per protocol, RT-PCR was one the most accurate tools available in the market. It is very sensitive to pick up even 10 to 100 viral nucleic acids present in a sample, he said.

Tamil Nadu, on an average, tests around 16,000 samples every day and has so far tested more than 5.92 samples, says data.
