Hemant wants mins probed for lockdown ‘violation’
2020-04-05
Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren wants his cabinet colleagues to come clean on allegations of flouting lockdown norms that may have aggravated the spread of corona virus.

Sources in the CMO said Hemant is unhappy with one of his ministers, Alamgir Alam, who arranged buses for ferrying labourers to Pakur and other parts of the state on March 29 despite the nationwide lockdown and no inter-district buses or trains operating.

Another minister, Haji Hussain Ansari, is also said to be under the CM’s scanner after his son’s name cropped up in the Intelligence Bureau’s (IB) list of those who attended the Tablighi Markaz in Delhi. Though Ansari and his son Tanveer both denied that anyone from their family went to Delhi, IB sleuths reported approached the family on the basis of Tanveer’s mobile GPS location.

“If a minister’s son is saying he never visited the Tablighi Markaz and IB has proof of his attendance there, then the matter can only be resolved through proper investigation,” Soren told media persons, adding, the minister in question and his family members have cooperated by accepting quarantine. While the minister is in home quarantine, his son has been taken to a government isolation centre.

Alam on the other hand denied that he had violated lockdown norms. “The labourers would have died out on the streets so some arrangement had to be made and when I arranged for the buses, the lockdown was not prohibiting internal movement for essential purposes,” he said, adding that officials orders can be verified and claiming that he was open to join any inquiry.
