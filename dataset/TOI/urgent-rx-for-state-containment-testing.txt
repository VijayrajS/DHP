Urgent Rx for state: Containment, testing
2020-04-11
Ahmedabad: As many as 21 individuals living in two apartments of Danilimda tested positive for Covid in a single day, on April 8. Of the total, six people has come in contact with a person who had tested positive earlier. Other cases are the result of local transmission, said state health department officials.

Indeed, densely populated areas of Gujarat are a source of serious worry for administrators. On April 5, Nagarwada-Saiyadpura area of Vadodara recorded the first positive case, a 54-year-old man. Five days later, as many as 48 cases were registered in the cluster.

In Ahmedabad, AMC officials said that 49 samples were taken at the field level on April 4. The number of samples taken on April 7, 8, and 9 were 602, 810, and 748. Majority of these samples were taken from the clustered areas, the officials said. Overall sampling has been ramped up in Gujarat with 1,519 samples being taken on Friday alone.

Experts say that intensive testing of the entire population in areas such as the Walled City in Ahmedabad is the only way to contain the spread of Covid.

“The classic example of what one case can do is presented in Gandhinagar where a single case resulted in 10 cases in the district, which has recorded 14 cases so far,” said a senior state health department official. “The death of an 80-year-old man on Friday — the first in the district — is also associated with the same case.”

The official said that three of the individuals have now been discharged. “But it doesn’t take away from the fact that a single infection spurred a massive exercise,” the official said. “It was to identify about 300 persons who had visited a government dispensary.”

Patan district officials said that they had no option but to lock down Nendra village, about 10km from Siddhpur, after the death of a 47-year-old man on April 5. “So far, nine people who had come in contact with the person have tested positive,” an official said. “We are awaiting the results of a few more tests. About 15 persons had come in contact with the original patient.”

In Surat, 1sq km area in Rander has been turned into a containment zone after two positive cases were reported. The area has so far reported one death and four new positive cases as the zone was expanded on April 7 up to Adajan Patiya.

Bharuch, which did not record any positive case till March 10, reported seven cases in a day on Friday. “Ikhar village with a population of 7,000 has been placed under containment as a 7km radius area in Amod taluka has been identified as the buffer zone,” said an official. “Intensive testing is likely to be initiated.”
