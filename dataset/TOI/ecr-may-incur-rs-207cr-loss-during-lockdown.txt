2020-04-03
PATNA: The East Central Railway (ECR) is expected to incur losses to the tune of Rs 207 crore due to the 21-day lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. 

According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the railways has cancelled altogether 663 trains originating from its five divisions from March 23 to April 14. 

“Approximately eight lakh passengers travel from different places under the ECR’s jurisdiction every day and yield Rs 9 crore as revenue. We have, therefore, assessed that the ECR will incur losses to the tune of Rs 207 crore during a period of 23 days because of the cancellation of all passenger trains,” the CPRO told this newspaper.

He added, “The assessment has been done only on the basis of earnings from passenger reservation system (PRS) and unreserved ticketing system (UTS) counters. The losses can escalate as tickets booked online from different parts of the state have not been taken into consideration yet.”

The ECR has already closed down its PRS and UTS counters and temporarily stopped providing Wi-Fi connectivity at all major stations under its five divisions. “We have given refunds to all those whose tickets were cancelled due to the lockdown,” the CPRO said.

ECR distributes 10k food packets: The ECR has reportedly distributed approximately 10,000 food packets and water bottles among the poor at the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Junction, Danapur, Barauni, Dhanbad, Samastipur, Narkatiaganj, Muzaffarpur and Gaya stations in the last three days.
