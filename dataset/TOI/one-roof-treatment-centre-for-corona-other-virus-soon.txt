Hyderabad: One-roof treatment centre for corona, other virus soon
2020-01-30
HYDERABAD: Chest Hospital will be developed as a special centre for treating the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and other highly-infectious viral diseases, such as swine flu, Ebola, zika and nipah. 


A ward within the hospital, replete with the latest technology, will be set up for the purpose. 

 
 
The special ward — to treat all infectious virus-related diseases under one roof — will be developed by next year at a cost of Rs 132 crore. At present, there is no centralised place in the state to treat such diseases.

The special room will house critical wards, isolation and general wards. The critical ward will be a 20-bed facility, while the isolation ward will have 60 beds and general ward will have 100 beds. There will be separate rooms for medical staff.

“Any patient suspected to be infected with these viruses will be put up in the general ward and tested. Those who test positive will be sent to the isolation ward or critical ward depending on the severity of the infection. Tests will be done separately for swine flu and corona virus, and then patients will be sent to the general ward. Meanwhile, patients suspected of more dangerous viruses like Ebola and Nipah will be directly sent to critical care wards,” said a senior official at the state health department.

“The centre will be set up in accordance with WHO guidelines. At present, special arrangements have been made at Gandhi Hospital, Fever Hospital and Chest Hospitals for treating patients with serious virus infection,” added the official.
