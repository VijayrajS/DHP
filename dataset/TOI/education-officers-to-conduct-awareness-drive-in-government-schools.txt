2020-02-22
PATNA: Following the Centre’s directive, the state education department has instructed district education officers (DEOs) and district programme officers (DPOs) to conduct awareness drive on coronavirus in government and government-aided schools in the wake of its outbreak in China.

Bihar Education Project Council project director Sanjay Kumar Singh issued a letter to the officials concerned on Thursday evening, directing them to spread awareness about the virus and step to be taken to keep students safe. He asked the DEOs and DPOs to share information pamphlet furnished by the Centre in this regard.

The preventive measures mentioned in the letter include frequent handwash and respiratory etiquettes like using handkerchief over mouth or using tissue paper or the shirt’s sleeve covering upper arm while coughing and sneezing.

The other preventive interventions are staying away from school and avoiding public gathering when sick.

“Experts still not have much information about coronavirus, but since it is a communicable disease, we need to make people aware how to prevent this disease by adopting measures. Along with the letter, I have also sent the Centre’s advisories for coronavirus, which will help the teachers and students understand precautionary measures. The pictorials in advisory are self-explanatory,” Singh said.

“There is no medicine or vaccine available for coronavirus. Only the awareness can prevent such disease,” he added.

In the letter, Singh stated: “The aim of the advisory is to make students aware of what the virus is and not to panic unnecessarily. Informed kids can be agents of change for their family, relatives and society at large.”
