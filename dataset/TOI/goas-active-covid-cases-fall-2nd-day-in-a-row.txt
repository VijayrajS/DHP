2020-05-28
Panaji: Goa’s active Covid-19 tally dropped for the second consecutive day as nine more patients were cured and discharged on Wednesday. They have been placed in facility quarantine for seven days, after which they will spend seven days in home quarantine. 

The day also saw one person who travelled from Maharashtra to Goa by road test positive for the novel coronavirus. He had gone to Mumbai to bring his family.

 He will now be treated at the Covid hospital in Margao. “The two family members who were with him have been tested and their results have come negative, but they are in quarantine and we will be watching them,” said health secretary Nila Mohanan. The state now has 31 active cases.

Out of the 637 samples tested on Wednesday, 524 results came negative, and 112 were awaited. Over 400 passengers were home-quarantined and 74 have been placed under facility quarantine. 

Meanwhile, a private laboratory, Suburban Diagnostic, that approached the directorate of health services (DHS) for permission to collect swabs, has got its nod. “It will send samples for testing to their laboratory in Mumbai,” Mohanan said.

Recently, the permission granted to another private laboratory as a collection centre was revoked after three positive patients reported by it tested negative after their samples were tested at the virology laboratory of Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim.

Mohanan said that on average, 350-400 people come to Goa by road every day. Rail and air arrivals change on a daily basis as it depends on whether or not trains are running.

Currently, everyone who is tested on arrival in Goa is charged Rs 2,000. Earlier, travellers coming in by road were not charged though they were tested. Also, while the option of bringing a Covid-19 negative certificate is also available, only 4-5 passengers have submitted such a certificate.
