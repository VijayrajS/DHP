Borough IV under strict coronavirus vigil
2020-05-12
Kolkata: Firhad Hakim, the chairperson of board of administrators that is governing the Kolkata Municipal Corporation now, came down heavily on a section of civic officials and ward coordinators (former councillors) for not being able to implement the lockdown rules in large parts of Burrabazar, Chitpore, Jorasanko and Jorabagan areas under Borough IV.

 Hakim, on Monday, visited the Borough IV office and interacted with the civic officials on the rapid spread of virus in these areas. 

Hakim expressed concern over Burrabazar where the number of Covid-19 positive cases is growing. The board chairperson wanted an explanation from the civic officials and ward coordinators why traders were allowed to continue with their business in the densely populated Raja Katra area in Burrabazar, which has been made a containment zone. He also expressed his concern over the wholesale milk market in Burrabazar. Hakim said efforts were on to find a parking zone for the trucks coming from outside the state. He was upset with a section of ward coordinators for their failure to implement the lockdown laws in Rabindra Sarani and Chitpore. He said the trucks coming to the wholesale fruit market at Mechua should be allowed entry as Rabindra Sarani has been one of the containment zones in the city. He also visited Pathuriaghata Street, which has also been made a containment zone, and asked the local ward coordinator Ellora Saha why shops were allowed to open there. 

Later at a meeting, Hakim instructed all the ward coordinators to work in tandem with civic officials and cops to combat the Covid-19 threat. “While we need to tighten lockdown rules in the areas registering a spurt in Covid cases, we should relax the rules in any containment area that refuses to record any fresh case in 14 days,” said Hakim.
