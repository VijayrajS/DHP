2020-03-14
Prayagraj: Hotels and restaurants in Prayagraj are busy counting losses as the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is forcing organisers to cancel events and parties. 

Hoteliers claim that several conferences and meetings scheduled to be held at their hotels have been cancelled due to travel restrictions imposed by several countries and the recent advisory urging residents to avoid gatherings and crowded places. 

Hotel owners said that occupancy of rooms has come down by 30-40% within the past 10 days due to the fear of an outbreak. 

A city-based hotelier said that the occupancy rates are likely to go down further over the next few days. He said that most of his clients are considering postponing conferences\seminars and parties in the wake of the health crisis. 

UP State Tourism Development Corporation (UPSTDC) senior manager DP Singh said the occupancy in two hotels of the corporation has gone down to 20 -30% in past 10 days. “Our clients started cancelling reservations within a week after coronavirus cases were reported in the country.”

Many travellers have also cancelled their vacations, especially those who had planned to visit coronavirus-affected destinations. 

“The virus outbreak has dealt a huge blow to the hotel industry in the city. Our international clients have almost stopped visiting the city and there is a drastic fall in our domestic business as well,” said another hotelier in the city.

Meanwhile, president of Prayagraj Hotel Association Sardar Joginder Singh said, “Occupancy in most hotels has decreased by 30-40% due to coronavirus. Worried travellers are either cancelling their bookings or postponing their plans. We have also restricted bookings by travellers from Asian countries like China, Hongkong, Japan and Macau.”
