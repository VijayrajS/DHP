Udaipur: Firm gets notice for laying off 175 staff during lockdown
2020-05-13
UDAIPUR: The joint labour commissioner has sent a notice to Jumio India Pvt Ltd over complaints that it has terminated 175 of its employees. Another 175-200 personnel have been reportedly kept in reserve, who have been asked to continue work but they won’t be paid for some time. The company deals with identity verification work. 

The Udaipur-based union has claimed that the firm’s decision to lay off employees and keep some of them in the unpaid category effective from May, violates a Central government order not to cut salaries or lay off people during the lockdown. Assistant manager Mahipal Singh Rathore told TOI that of the 800 employees of the company, 175 persons were served termination orders on May 5. 

“Soon after the lockdown in Rajasthan, all of the employees have been working from home and things had improved with business volume also faring well since last month. We were always assured by the management that our jobs are secure and we need not worry about salaries either, but they issued the termination letters suddenly,” Mahipal Singh Rathore, assistant manager of Udaipur branch office said. 

He further said that most of the people terminated were receiving Rs 15,000-18,000 per month and around 35 of them are women. The employees on Tuesday too, met the labour commissioner who assured them of appropriate action against the management.
