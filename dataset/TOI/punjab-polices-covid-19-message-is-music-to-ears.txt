JALANDHAR: A video showing policemen singing and dancing to create awareness on precautions to be taken to stop the spread of coronavirus went viral in a day after being uploaded on social media platforms. The video has been produced by the Punjab police, which is enforcing shutdown and helping shift suspected coronavirus patients to isolation and quarantine centres. 


Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and DGP Dinkar Gupta shared the video on their official Twitter handles. Besides having thousands of views and hundreds of shares, it has also been widely circulated on WhatsApp. 

The video, which has been produced in the lawns of the Punjab Armed Police (PAP) headquarters in Jalandhar, features PAP personnel. Punjabi bolis have been used to convey the message of precautions needed to stop the spread of the pandemic. 

The video starts with the popular line, " Baari Barsi khattan gaya see, khat ke liyanda sona, baahn vich khangh sohneya aiven kar na dein corona." The words underline the need to cough into the elbow to prevent infection. The lead singer, an assistant sub-inspector of PAP and other officials are seen dancing to the tune in the background with another demonstrating cough etiquette. The second stanza demonstrates how to cover the face, the third warns people against shaking hands and promotes the Sat Sri Akal greeting.
