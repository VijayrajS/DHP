BHUBANESWAR/CUTTACK: The commissonerate police on Saturday picked up around 170 people here for coming out on the streets in defiance of the government’s 48-hour ‘total shutdown’ in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Bhadrak from 8 pm on Friday. The people who were picked up by the cops were taken to a quarantine centre in a
hostel in Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT).


At the time of filing this report, police had allowed 130 violators to leave on personal recognition (PR) bond, while the rest were still in the quarantine facility. In Cuttack, three persons were arrested and released on PR bond while, in Bhadrak, 10 violators were detained in a government-run quarantine home.

Twin cities police commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi said people mostly stayed indoors and no shops or facilities other than designated ones were opened. “We deployed our personnel in many places. The people who came out were picked up and taken to the quarantine facility. Many of them were later released on bail. The shutdown has been successful overall. In Cuttack, too, people stayed indoors,” he said. Cuttack detected its first coronavirus positive patient on Friday, prompting the government to include the city on its shutdown list. Cuttack DCP Akhileshvar Singh said residents had fully respected the shutdown and stayed indoors. “Except the three who were arrested and released on PR bond, people largely cooperated with us to make the shutdown successful,” he said.

Around 100 police personnel including the DCP himself visited Buxibazar, Sutahat, Odia Bazar and Patapole areas of Cuttack while Bhubaneswar DCP Anup Sahu and traffic DCP Sagarika Nath visited the restricted area of Bomikhal to ensure that no unauthorized person was loitering on the road
