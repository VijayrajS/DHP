2020-04-02
INDORE/BHOPAL: A whopping 31 patients tested positive for Covid-19 in Indore between Tuesday midnight and Wednesday, taking its tally to 75. The city also got its first child corona patients, three kids aged 5 to 8 years, and first police officer to test positive.


The day’s count included Khargone’s first Covid-19 case, a 65-year-old hotel owner from Mandleshwar who had died during treatment on March 29. His test came positive late Tuesday night.

On a happy note, however, Gwalior’s first Covid-19 patient tested negative, so did 13 first contacts in Jabalpur. All of them may be discharged on Thursday.

Indore, which is in total lockdown, now accounts for 76% of MP’s tally of 98. Collector Manish Singh had on Tuesday said the city should “mentally prepare” for the Covid-19 count to rise to 150.

With the Khargone death, MP’s toll has gone up to six, half of them in Indore.

In Wednesday midnight’s bulletin, new Covid-19 cases were reported for the first time in five localities — Snehlataganj, Samajvad Nagar, Ambikapuri, Gandhi Nagar and Moti Tabela. Health officials could not confirm any travel history or contact history in 11 of the cases. Only one of the patients had a contact history with a patient. 

The bulletin said the condition of 8 patients of Indore’s 75 patients is critical.

Amid the grim tidings in Indore, there was news of hope from other areas — 48 test reports in Gwalior came back negative and 13 people in Jabalpur, who had come in contact with Covid-19 patients, were discharged from hospital quarantine after 14 days as they all tested negative.

In Jabalpur, 27 samples have tested negative in the past few days and the condition of all eight patients is stable. In Satna, all 14 suspected patients tested negative.

Lockdown is in force in all districts, but Gwalior and Bhind were closed completely like Indore.
