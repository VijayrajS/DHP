KMC poll schedule depends on fight against Covid-19
2020-04-16
Kolhapur: The schedule for Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections is likely to remain unaltered if the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic ends in the next couple of months.

The civic elections are scheduled to be held in November and the preparation for updating the voter list and ward reservation is slated to begin in June. The model code of conduct for the elections is likely to come into effect in October.

A couple of days ago, the state election commission deferred the elections for some municipal corporations and councils to be held in June by three months.

The process of drafting the voter list and ward reservation has been asked to stop immediately as all civic administrations are busy dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak. 

A senior KMC official said, "We have not initiated any sort of election-related work. Last month, we had decided to seek applications from former civic staff to assist us in election-related work. We have received the applications, but we are yet to scrutinise them as everyone is focussed on dealing with the coronavirus crisis. We have received no communication from the election commission either."

Also, a lot depends on how the the monsoon rolls out this year. Last year, owing to unprecedented floods in Panchganga river over 10,000 families had to be moved to shelter homes. 

According to the official, monsoon will be one of the hurdles in preparing for the elections and if there are floods, the entire civic machinery will be busy till October-end.

"Before elections are held or scheduled the election commission takes into consideration all the factors which may affect the process. Also the political parties will also be consulted. If the coronavirus crisis ends and there is no havoc due to monsoon, we expect the elections to take place in November itself," the official said.
