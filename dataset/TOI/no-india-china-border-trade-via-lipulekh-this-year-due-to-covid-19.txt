No India-China border trade via Lipulekh this year due to Covid-19
2020-05-29
Pithoragarh: The annual border trade between India and China through the Lipulekh Pass, which starts from June 1 and lasts until October 31, will not take place this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Indian traders in the region. Another reason behind calling off the annual trade was that merchants were unable to make any preparations this year due to the two-month-long lockdown.

Traders added that there was no preparation by the government as well. Ahead of the trade, the government opens a temporary customs office, a bank branch and a police check post at Gunji to facilitate trading.

Suspension of trade comes even as tensions between the two countries have been rising since Nepal released a map showing the disputed Kalapani region as part of its territory. 

AK Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate (Dharchula) told TOI that more than 100 traders held a meeting with the administration on Wednesday and informed them that they would not be trading this year due to Covid-19 outbreak. Bishan Singh Garbyal, patron of India China Border Trade Organisation, said traders have decided not to do business this year due to fears of Covid-19 spread and also because they were unable to make any preparations due to lockdown.

Last year, the administration had issued 265 trade passes. Indian traders had imported goods worth Rs 33 lakh and exported items worth Rs 1.25 crore. Traders import ready-made garments, shoes, raw wool and blanket while they export candy, jaggery and cosmetic items.

The border trade between India and China started in 1992 and is facilitated on the Indian side by the ministry of external affairs.
