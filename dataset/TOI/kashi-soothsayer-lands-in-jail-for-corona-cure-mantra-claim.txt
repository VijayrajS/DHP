2020-03-20
VARANASI: Just days after the arrest of one ‘Coronawale Baba’ in Lucknow, a man in Varanasi landed behind bars on Thursday for claiming that his ‘mantra’ could cure Covid-19 patients as well as prevent the infection.


Sanjay Tiwari, a self-proclaimed astrologer and resident of Samneghat under Lanka police station, has been distributing pamphlets that read, “Mantra lijiye aur coronavirus se mukti payiye (Learn this mantra to get rid of coronavirus).” 

The pamphlets, which also carry his mobile number, said that infected patients would be cured after reciting the mantra, while others chanting it would not get the infection. 

Pictures of the leaflets went viral on social media after which Lanka police swung into action. “Tiwari was rounded up from his Samneghat residence and has been booked for disrupting public order,” said inspector (crime) Mohit Yadav.

Five days ago, Lucknow police had arrested one Ahmed Siddiqui from Wazirganj following his claim that a ‘tabeez (amulet)’ he had prepared could treat coronavirus infection.
