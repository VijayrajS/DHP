Maharashtra: Give Covid-19 test results in 48 hrs, not 4 days, private labs told
2020-04-02
MUMBAI: The state has directed private laboratories to speed up testing of Covid-19 samples to produce results within 48 hours or less from the up to four days it takes now. One of the eight private laboratories in the state has also been pulled up for the quality of swab tests done to check for the virus, said health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday.

Delay in results, said doctors, adds to the anxiety of suspected patients. Private laboratories, though, cite shortage of kits as well as swab material in the market for the delay in conducting tests. While admitting to the shortage of kits, Tope said, “We have asked private laboratories not to collect swabs if they do not have enough testing kits.” 

The majority of tests in Mumbai are performed by public sector labs at Kasturba, KEM and JJ hospitals and Haffkine Institute. So far, highest number of samples tested on a single day in the city is 1,203. Testing facilities have gradually been scaled up in the city over the past few weeks to allay fears that the extent of testing was not in proportion to the spread of the infection.

However, private laboratories began collecting samples despite not having adequate testing kits, leading to a bottleneck. BMC commissioner Pravin Pardeshi on Sunday asked private laboratories not to collect samples until they could balance out the number of tests with the kits they procure on a daily basis. Thereafter, for three days, most private laboratories did not collect samples. 

Dr Nilesh Shah of Metropolis Laboratory said it resumed testing on Wednesday. “There is a shortage of kits, swabs and reagents, vendors are unable to get adequate numbers,” he said, adding the situation could improve soon.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani also said private labs have been asked to wait till they have enough testing kits.

Private doctors are unhappy though. Respiratory physician Dr Sujeet Rajan, who consults with Bhatia Hospital, said lab reports initially needed a turnaround time of 24 hours that got extended as the workload increased. “Now reports take up to 72 hours,” he said, adding patients of chronic lung disease bear the brunt. “Most have symptoms that mimic coronavirus and are hence quarantined with other Covid-19 suspect cases. They spend two to three days with other suspect cases as a result, and could end up getting the infection,” he said.

Physician Dr Pratit Samdani said, “The test shouldn’t take 48 hours or more. As physicians, we cannot start treating if patients are asymptomatic. In such situations, a report helps us decide the next course of action,” he said. The report also decides duration of the quarantine. 

“All pneumonia patients are assumed to be Covid-19 unless a test proves otherwise. So the longer we wait for the reports, the longer it takes to move him out either to the isolation ward or a non-Covid area,” said the doctor.
