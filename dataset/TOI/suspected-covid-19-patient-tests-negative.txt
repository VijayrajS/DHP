Nashik: A 26-year-old patient who was rushed to the isolation ward of the Nashik civil hospital in a suspected coronavirus case has tested negative, district collector Suraj Mandhare confirmed on Sunday.

The district administration has, however, appealed to all citizens, especially those who have recently travelled abroad, to take cognizance of the symptoms and immediately contact the nearest public health centre if they observe any symptoms of the virus. 

The suspect had returned to Mumbai from Italy on February 26. From Mumbai, he travelled to Nashik by a sleeper bus. 

Having returned from an affected country, medical officers in the city visited the patient on February 27 and 28. Upon examining, they did not notice any cold, fever, cough or breathlessness. 

However, on February 29, the patient complained of cold and breathlessness, following which he was immediately admitted to the civil hospital. Samples of his throat swab were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for investigation. 

The report of the throat swab arrived on Sunday and the patient was tested negative.
