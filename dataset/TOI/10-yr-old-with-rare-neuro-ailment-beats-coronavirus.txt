JAIPUR: A 10-year-old girl, who was suffering from a rare neurological disorder, defeated Covid-19 in Jaipur. Doctors said they did not have much knowledge about how she would respond to Covid-19 treatment given her neurological disorder, but eventually she managed to beat the virus. 

“She was the first case of Covid-19 accompanied by the rare disease of Covid-19in the state. There was a concern about how she will respond to the treatment. Globally there is not much literature available about how patients with rare diseases suffering from Covid-19 need to be treated. We provided her hydroxychloroquine. It was nice to see that she responded well,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, superintendent of JK Lon Hospital and an expert of rare diseases. However, the girl took a much longer time to recover in comparison to other children. The day Aditi (name changed) complained of seizures, her family rushed her to JK Lon Hospital where she tested positive for Covid-19. She was admitted to the Covid-19 ward on May 1. 

Due to her medical condition, the girl is unable to speak and depend on others for routine work. She only can hear and remains in bed all the time.

Her father narrated the ordeal he had faced in the last 15 days. “Since birth, my daughter has been suffering from rare neurodevelopment disorder known as Rett syndrome. Her physical growth is just like any normal child but her mind has not developed. On April 29, she complained of seizures and we rushed her to JK Lon Hospital, where she tested positive,” said her father. “We rushed her for treatment for seizures, which is common in Rett syndrome. We were not aware that she was suffering from Covid-19 too. They took my samples and I was found infected with the virus too,” he said.
