200 beds to be set up for non-covid patients
2020-05-26
Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is planning to set up 200 beds in the newly constructed building of Bytco hospital in the city to treat non-covid patients amid the outbreak of the pandemic. 

The newly constructed building of the Bytco hospital, which was built at a cost of over Rs 40 crore, has not been used for the past one year as NMC is yet to get the workforce, including doctors and nurses, to make the new hospital operational. 

The five-decade-old Bytco Hospital, managed by the civic body, is one of the busiest hospitals located in Nashik Road area of the city. 

NMC had taken a decision to set up additional building of the hospital due to an increase of footfall at the hospital. The new 200-bedded building has a modular operation theatre. 

“We have completed the civil and electrification works at the building of the new building. We will soon start the furniture work. The policy decisions whether to recruit a workforce on its own or outsource the medical staff is to be taken by the general body meeting,” said NMC officials.

“The proposal in this connection is soon to be tabled at the GB meeting shortly,” added the NMC officials.
