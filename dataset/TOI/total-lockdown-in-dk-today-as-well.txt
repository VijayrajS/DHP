Total lockdown in DK today as well
2020-03-29
Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannada will remain under complete lockdown on Sunday as well. Extending Friday’s decision to put the district under 24 hours lockdown from 12am on Saturday, the district administration and district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari on Saturday said the lockdown will be extended to Sunday as well. Barring essentials like milk, newspapers, pharmacies and petrol bunks, all other services and shops will remain shut.

Announcing this after reviewing the situation with the district administration, Poojari said the administration will revisit its decision again on Sunday. Appealing to all to cooperate with this directive, Poojari said 210 A grade temples under the department of religious endowment, that he heads, will supply food to migrant labourers and destitute in their respective areas across the state, from Sunday, and an order for the same has been issued with immediate effect.

Likewise, honouring an appeal from Yakshagana artistes – both Badagathittu and Thenkuthittu —who primarily work in Yakshagana melas of temples under the endowment department sponsored Yakshagana melas in the coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada, will receive their salaries for the lockdown period. The respective temples will bear the salaries from their corpus, and this move will benefit around 2,500-odd artistes, he said.

To mitigate the hardship caused by the lockdown on households, Poojari said the district administration will launch an app soon, using which people can place orders for essential items. Alternatively, one can also call the district Covid-19 helpline, 1077, where they will be given the numbers of grocery stores nearest to them, which in turn will deliver essential items to people’s doorsteps. MLAs D Vedavyas Kamath, Y Bharath Shetty and district secretary V Ponnuraj were present.
