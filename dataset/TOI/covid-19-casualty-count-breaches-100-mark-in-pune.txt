2020-05-03
Pune: The Covid-19 casualty count in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) breached the 100-mark with four more people succumbing to the contagion on Saturday, making PMR the second after Mumbai to reach this “dreaded figure”.

The first Covid-19 death in Pune was reported on March 30. From there, it took 33 days to reach the 100-mark. A majority of these casualties have been reported at Sassoon hospital. 

The 100th Cavid-19 casualty was recorded in a 68-year old from Ghorpadi, who succumbed to the contagion at Sassoon hospital on Saturday. He was admitted in the hospital on April 24 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Three more deaths occurred at the Sassoon hospital on Saturday, including a 73-year old Manjari man with ARDS, who also suffered from hypertension, TB and asthma. 

Two of these deaths were reported on May 1. However, their throat swab reports came positive for the contagion on Saturday. These include a 77-year-old man from Mangalwar Peth who was admitted to the Sassoon hospital on April 30 and a 72-year-old man from Laxminagar Tadiwala Road. 

When asked about the high deaths at Sassoon hospital, medical experts said attributed the numbers to the fact that most patients were referred to the hospital when they were already in critical conditions. 

Of 103 deaths reported in the region so far, maximum were from age group of 50 to 80 years and with co-morbidity conditions. 

Civic health officials said they had been constantly appealing the residents to visit flu clinics operational all over the city in case of symptoms of cough, cold and fever. Senior citizens with co-morbidity should take more precautions, they said. 

Positive cases at 1,912

The PMR recorded 97 fresh positive cases on Saturday, taking the total case tally to 1,912 so far. On Friday, 115 new cases were detected in the region. Of total 1,912 positive cases, most have been reported in Pune city (1,704) followed by Pimpri Chinchwad (115) and the rural areas (93).
