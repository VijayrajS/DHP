MEERUT: More men have been found to be infected by coronavirus than women. In Meerut, men account for 68% of the total cases in the district.


Out of the total 117 cases in Meerut district -- besides the one who is admitted in Kanpur -- 80 are men. The remaining 37 cases are that of women.

According to doctors, globally, too, more men have been hit by the virus than women.

Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer, said, “More men have been affected by the virus because generally they venture out of the house more than women – be it for grocery shopping or for work. Some people also attribute difference in hormones in males and females for more cases among men. However, no research has been done so far to substantiate this reason.”

Causing severe acute respiratory syndrome, Covid-19 is mainly spread between people coming in close contact, often via droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. The droplets fall on the ground or surfaces rather than remaining in the air over long distances. People may also become infected by touching these contaminated surfaces and then, touching their face.

Commenting on the data of Meerut, Dr Rachna Tandon, Meerut district epidemiologist, said, “The data reveals that the section of population more prone to catch the infection is one which usually is expected to go out of the house for earning a living i.e. men belonging to the age group of 21-60 years. It is advised that while we carry out our daily activities, we maintain sufficient physical distancing, use face masks and practice good hygiene to avoid catching the infection.”

According to the report prepared by the health department, the most affected are in the age group of 11-20 years – with men accounting for 19 cases in this bracket and women nine, making a total of 28 cases in this age group.
