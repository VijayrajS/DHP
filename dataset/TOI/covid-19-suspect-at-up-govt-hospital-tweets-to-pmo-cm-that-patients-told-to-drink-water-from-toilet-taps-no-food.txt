Meerut Medical College (doesn't) have proper infrastructure, no food or water (since) the last 20 hours here... help (sic),” read the tweet.TOI could not access the hospital’s quarantine ward, but patients inside gave almost the same account when contacted on phone. They shared pictures and videos which corroborated the version shared by the patient on twitter.Another patient, a 30-year-old from Hastinapur, said, “Drinking water is a major issue here. At a time when special care should be taken about anything we eat or drink, we are not even getting filtered water. We are being told to fill water from the washroom taps.”When contacted, Dr RC Gupta, principal of LLRM Medical College, said, “We haven’t got any such complaint so far. However, now that the matter has been brought to our notice, we will look into it.”
