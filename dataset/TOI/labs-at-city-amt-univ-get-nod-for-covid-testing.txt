2020-05-02
Nagpur/Amravati: Finally, Nagpur and Amravati can breathe a sigh of relief. On Friday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) gave approval to the city-based Dhruv Pathology and Molecular Diagnostic Lab in Ramdaspeth to collect samples and conduct tests for Covid-19 and a day later, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University got the nod for the same.

As per ICMR guidelines, the cost of swab sample testing in private labs will be Rs4,500.

“We received the approval on Friday evening. We are ready with the set up and manpower, and looking forward to start testing samples from Monday,” said Dr Shailesh Mundhada, director of Dhruv lab.

As per ICMR guidelines, labs can test samples of anyone who has prescription of test from a qualified doctor. But, in Nagpur, the NMC has directed private labs to collect samples of only those patients who are admitted in hospitals and recommended for tests by treating doctors. “In case the patient is showing symptoms of Covid-19, doctors will approach us and our team will collect samples,” said Mundhada.

ICMR, on Friday, issued a list of 105 private labs in the country where Covid-19 tests can be conducted. The list includes 24 labs from Maharashtra. Apart from Nagpur, private labs in Thane, Nashik, and Karad also received approvals. Earlier, 19 labs based in Pune and Mumbai had got approvals.

Meanwhile, the much-awaited ICMR approval for the covid swab testing lab at Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University came on Saturday. Dr Prashant Them, associate professor, department of biotechnology, is the lab’s nodal officer.

Guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said the lab would start functioning from Monday. “All the technical hurdles have been cleared and ICMR has granted approval. Amravati University got the login id from ICMR on Saturday evening. Home minister Amit Deshmukh made the login id available to the varsity within two hours. The lab will start sample testing work from Monday,” Thakur told TOI.

The lab is ready with two trained batches. Each batch will test 24 samples daily. Two more batches have been sent for training after which, the lab would be able to give 96 reports every day.

Personal protection equipments (PPEs) and other items would be provided to the lab through DPC funds. “There will be no shortage of funds. We used to send samples to AIIMS (Nagpur), Akola and Wardha for testing. Now, they will be tested here, thus saving precious time and expediting the treatment process,” said Thakur, adding work at the lab at Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Medical College and forensic lab is also under way. 

“When these three labs start functioning, they all will benefit the region,” she said.
