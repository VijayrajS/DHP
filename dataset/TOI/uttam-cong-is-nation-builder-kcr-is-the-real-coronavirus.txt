2020-03-16
Hyderabad: In a strong counter-attack to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s comment that Congress was coronavirus of the country, Telangana Congress president and Nalgonda MP Uttam Kumar Reddy termed ‘KCR as the real coronavirus’ while Congress is a nation builder.

“KCR said that a paracetamol tablet was enough to fight coronavirus and was not serious about the issue until the state cabinet took a decision to shut down places of public gatherings,” said Uttam.

“His comments in the assembly that coronavirus does not survive in temperatures above 27 degree celsius only exposed his lack of knowledge about the virus and the magnitude of damage the virus can cause if it spreads,” Uttam added. The TPCC chief demanded that KCR withdraw his remarks and tender an unconditional apology to the Congress. TNN
