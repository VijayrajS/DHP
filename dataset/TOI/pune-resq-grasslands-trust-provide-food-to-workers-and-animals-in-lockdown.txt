Pune: RESQ, Grasslands Trust provide food to workers and animals in lockdown
2020-05-02
PUNE: City-based RESQ Charitable Trust and The Grasslands Trust have distributed over 4,200 kgs of human food ration and 250 kgs animal feed to about 75 families of the local grassland communities as well as daily wage workers and their animals, which were stranded in Jejuri, Morgaon, Kadus and Vadgaon in Pune district during lockdown. 


"They had not received any wages or government compensation, and had no means to procure food as the lockdown imposed restrictions did not allow them to move for it," said Neha Panchamiya, founder and president, RESQ Charitable Trust.

The Grassland Trust, an NGO that works towards the conservation of wildlife found in grassland and scrubland habitats, regularly comes across these families in the course of their work. Members of The Grassland Trust, Pratik Joshi and Mihir Godbole had reached out to Panchamiya at the RESQ Charitable, who collaborated on this effort to assess the need, procure food and transport it for the humans and animals who needed it. 

The RESQ Charitable Trust has been working in Pune since 2007 towards reducing human-animal conflict through their rescue, rehabilitation, education and awareness activities for domestic animals and wildlife. Through the COVID-19 lockdown, RESQ has provided aid for thousands of animals of all kinds through their relief efforts. 

Around 300 people and 45 animals were fed for one-month during this activity.

â€œWe had already distributed over 33 tonnes of food for animals since the lockdown - for dogs, horses, cattle through a network of over 300 volunteers and feeders across Pune, PCMC, Lonavala and Matheran. When I heard about these families and their animals, I wanted to help them because they were stranded in such places which were completely out the view of city-folk and where no kind of relief, government or otherwise, had reached," said Panchamiya.
