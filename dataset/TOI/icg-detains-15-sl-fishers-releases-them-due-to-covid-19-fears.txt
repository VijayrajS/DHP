Madurai: Fifteen Sri Lankan fishermen who were fishing in three mechanised boats were detained by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Wednesday, on charges of crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). However, the fishermen, who were to be handed over to the Tuticorin Marine police on Thursday, were reportedly handed over to the Sri Lankan enforcement officials due to Covid-19 scare.

Marine police sources said the boats were spotted about 70 nautical miles (130km), south of Kanyakumari. A communication from the ICG, Tuticorin, said that they apprehended three boats - Sugandhi, Seral and Netmi - during a security patrol for violation of sections 3 and 7 of The Maritime Zones of India (Regulation of Fishing by Foreign Vessels) Act, 1981. Escorted by ICG ship Abiraj, they were expected to reach the Tuticorin harbour around 11.30am on Thursday and handed over to the marine police for questioning. It is learnt that they were taken back to IMBL due to global Covid-19 outbreak. ICG officials in Tuticorin were not available for comment on the reason behind releasing Lankan fishermen. 

The marine police said that a stretch between 100 to 150 nautical miles south of Kanyakumari is a wedge bank for mechanised boats from Sri Lanka. They suspected that the men could have accidentally crossed the IMBL while fishing. Marine police sources added that fishermen were also not involved in smuggling or activities that posed a threat to Indiaâ€™s national security, following which the ICG handed them over to the Lankan navy.
