Shikaripara locals defy lockdown to demand ration
2020-04-23
Dumka: Several residents of Sarasdangal village under Shikaripara block defied lockdown orders and hit the Dumka-Rampurhat Road on Tuesday alleging that they were yet to receive their quota of dry ration promised by the Jharkhand government. 

Dozens of men and women stood on the road for hours claiming that the local PDS dealer was charging them money to provide 10kg food grain, which was supposed to be given for free to families without ration card during the lockdown. 

“My income has dried up ever since the imposition of lockdown,” said Munni Kisku, a local. “But, till now, no government official or elected representative has turned up with the ration,” Kisku alleged. The Shikaripara assembly seat is currently held by JMM’s Nalin Soren. 

Some of the locals even tried to ransack a mini truck carrying sacks of rice when the vehicle was plying close to the demonstration site on Tuesday. 

Besides distributing food grains through PDS shops, the government has asked panchayat mukhiyas to arrange ration for the needy from their Rs 10,000 contingency fund. But locals claimed that the mukhiya has not done that either. 

When contacted, Dumka deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B said: “I have sought a report about Tuesday’s incident from the BDO and the circle officer. Interestingly, a few well-off residents led the crowd. We are investigating the matter.”
