Don’t take names of Covid patients: Vadodara CP
2020-04-17
Vadodara: Police department has urged Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) not to give out details of persons who test positive for coronavirus before they are hospitalized. City police commissioner Anupam Singh wrote a letter to municipal commissioner Nalin Upadhyay on Tuesday and urged him to keep details and names of such patients a secret. 

Gahlaut said in his letter that names of persons who tested positive for coronavirus after mass sampling in Nagarwada and Saiyyadpura on April 7 went public even before they could be taken to hospital. The list of names went viral on WhatsApp and it caused panic in the concerned localities. 

Gahlaut said those who test positive for the virus may abscond or take some extreme step if they are not hospitalized first. ‘Hence, it’s better to not make names of those who test positive from Nagarwada and Saiyyadpura area public before they are sent to hospital,’ Gahlaut said.
