Birders on the wing as lockdown cedes city back to nature
2020-04-10
Meerut: As Covid-19 scare forces humans retreat to the safety of their homes, hundreds of birds have begun thronging cities and filling up silence with mellifluous callings as breeding season kicks off that prompts egg-laying. There cannot be a better opportunity to capture mating-oriented colour-enhanced birds in the camera, feel city’s birdwatchers. They share their experiences from within the confines of their homes while clicking flying visitors, some of whom have perched on their windows after decades. “This is for the first time that I heard the call of a peafowl. Recently, I saw a painted stork and a flock of four black ibis fly over my house,” says ornithologist Rajat Bhargava. Surgeon Dr Joseph Zaidi, who is an avid birdwatcher, said, “I live in cantonment which already has a green cover but there is a noticeable increase in the number of birds visited the area. There are birds all around. No sound, no human activity, no vehicles and no pollution – what can be more salubrious? After years, I saw a grey francolin and white-breasted water hen. Hornbills are abundant.”Interestingly, this is the time of the year when birds pair and breed. With minimal human activity in the city areas, they are flamboyantly displaying love signs to seek mates. “For the first time I saw a mating sequence of the rufous treepie right near my doorstep,” says an upbeat Bhargava. Nischint Nehra, a businessman, said, “It’s so thrilling to see so many peacocks in our vicinity. It seems we are living in a forest with birds chirping throughout the day.”
