Passengers who arrived from Kuwait, the UAE, Oman and Qatar at RGI Airport on Wednesday were shifted to different quarantine centres in the city.

Since Wednesday morning, nearly 1,300 passengers who arrived in 10 different flights were shifted from the airport and they were quarantined. The effort to shift them from airport and accommodating them in different quarantine centers was being done by health, revenue and police officials in coordination.

On Sunday, the government initially decided to quarantine passengers who have been coming from seven countries -- China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France. But on Wednesday, officials decided to quarantine passengers coming from Kuwait, the UAE, Oman and Qatar also. Passengers have been screened and they are being either quarantined at the government-declared centres or asked them to self-quarantine in their homes.

Health, revenue officials along with police are coordinating the process of transporting passengers from the airport to quarantine centres.
