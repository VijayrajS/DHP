Covid-19 pandemic: Karnataka govt to offer dole to labourers
2020-03-22
BENGALURU: Karnataka government is all set to take a leaf out of the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government and provide direct cash transfer to daily wage and construction workers, whose livelihood has been hit by the Covid-19 crisis.


On Saturday, it was reported that Adityanath had announced direct cash transfer of Rs 1,000 for daily wage labourers. Following the report, the Karnataka labour department was asked to ascertain the level of assistance the government can provide to daily wage labourers here. Labour minister Shivram Hebbar is expected to discuss the issue with officials on Monday, and send a proposal to CM BS Yediyurappa.

Hebbar said, “If we do it, we need to do it in a manner which will provide parity to all labour groups. There are three categories — organised, unorganised and construction workers. While data is available on organised and construction workers, we do not have any numbers on the unorganised sector. However, we hope to offer some assistance by next week.”

Officials have been asked to gather details about similar schemes from UP and Maharashtra. Karnataka has a construction workers’ welfare board, which has an unused corpus of Rs 8,000 crore.
