Unruly patients to be housed in separate quarantine wards
2020-04-13
Ludhiana: Two days after a 22-year-old quarantined man spat all over the civil hospital male isolation ward and misbehaved with the staff, the authorities have decided to admit such patients to Level-I isolation wards and take legal action against them.

A Level-I isolation ward houses those with mild symptoms. 

They will be given almost the same facilities as in civil hospital. Level-I isolation wards are set up in government buildings, like Meritorious School in Tagore Naga, near Hero Heart DMCH with 800 beds; PAU hostels 1, 2 and 4 with 600 beds; PAU hostel 11 with 500 beds; and Kular College of Nursing, Kishangarh, Khanna, with 500 beds. The health department will begin with Meritorious School.

On April 10, the 22-year-old patient spat all around the nursing station, on tiles of male isolation ward, floor, handles and even taps of washrooms. He also rolled himself on all the beds of the ward.

Civil hospital medical officer (physiatrist) Dr Vivek Goyal, said, “The patient was examined that day. He was delirious and advised routine investigation and medication. He is a suspected Covid-19 patient. His condition is improving.”
