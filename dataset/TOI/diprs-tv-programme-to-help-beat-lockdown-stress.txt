2020-05-21
Jammu: To spread awareness about the psychological impact of the lockdown and measures to be adopted to overcome it, the department of information and public relations (DIPR) on Tuesday started a new initiative ‘Sukoon’.

“The programme will be telecast on DD (K) every Tuesday at 9pm and psychiatrists and social scientists will give sessions on psychological health and how to keep the mind anxiety-free,” an official spokesperson said.

He added that the the initiative was in line with the growing concern that the pandemic and the prolonged lockdown had resulted in tremendous stress among various sections of the society. 

“Parents, care givers and children are the greatest victims of lockdown as they grapple with restricted movement and are not being allowed to socialise,” the official said.

“It is now all the more important that counselling sessions are held to beat the anxiety creeping in large sections of our society,” the official added

On ‘Sukoon’ programme, eminent doctors and scientists will share their knowledge regarding the measures which people can adopt to keep stress level under control.

The DIPR is also looking at telecasting such programmes on a daily basis to reach out to the people of the UT to ensure that they have a healthy mind in healthy body.
