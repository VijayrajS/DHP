VARANASI: A coronavirus suspect, who had returned from Malaysia recently and was admitted to isolation ward on developing fever, cold and cough, fled from the hospital on Wednesday evening before his sample could be collected and sent to BHU laboratory in Varanasi for test. However, later the patient was traced at his home and was quarantined there itself, said chief medical officer Ballia Dr Pritam Mishra.


CMS of Ballia district hospital Dr B P Singh said, “A youth from Pakka Kot village had returned from Malaysia with his companions on March 14. On March 16, he complained of fever following cold, sneezing and coughing. He reached the hospital on Wednesday morning and was kept in isolation ward. However, when doctors visited the ward in the evening to collect his sample he was found missing.” We sounded an alarm and informed the district magistrate and SP, said Singh. 

This was the second such incident in a gap of three days. Earlier, a coronavirus suspect patient had fled from isolation ward of Mirzapur divisional hospital on March 16 night, but he was sent back to the hospital by his family.
