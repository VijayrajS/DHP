As coronavirus fear rises, chicken sales drop by 60% in Ghaziabad
2020-03-10
GHAZIABAD: The sale of non-vegetarian products, especially chicken, has gone down by more than 60% in Ghaziabad in the wake of the coronavirus scare. Even Holi, when the demand is usually high, has failed to make much difference in the sale of chicken. 


Traders said that during Holi, the demand for meat goes up as high as 20 times. "But there is hardly any customer this year," said Salman Qureshi, a meat seller from Raj Nagar Extension. "Around 80% of my customers have not been buying meat because of the misconception that coronavirus spreads from chicken. No doubt, the price has gone down in the wholesale market. If we reduce price in the retail market too, our survival will become difficult," he added.

The situation at restaurants and food joints isn't any better. Deepak Singh, manager of a restaurant in Ahinsa Khand 2, said, "Ever since the news of coronavirus started beaming on TV channels, customers have been staying away from non-vegetarian products. We are getting just 5-10 customers a day against at least 40 on normal days. Even those who are coming are asking for mutton. Chicken has completely gone off the table," he added.

Chicken suppliers from the Ghazipur wholesale market said the rate has dipped by Rs 50 a kg. Mohammad Naushad Qureshi, a wholesale chicken supplier at the Ghaziapur Murga Mandi, said, "The sale has gone down by 75%. In Haryana, the price for a kilo of chicken at poultry farms is Rs 28-30, while in Maharashtra, it is selling as cheap as Rs 10 a kg. It is poultry farmers who are the losers here."

Ghaziabad chief medical officer NK Gupta clarified there is no harm in consuming well-cooked non-vegetarian food items, but advised caution against buying semi-cooked and frozen items.
