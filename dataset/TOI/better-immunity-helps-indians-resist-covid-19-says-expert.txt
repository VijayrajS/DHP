Bihar: Better immunity helps Indians resist Covid-19, says expert
2020-05-29
PATNA: Covid-19 infection and fatality rates in India are much less than those in the USA because of the better immune system of Indians and strict enforcement of lockdown in the country, said Dr Amarendra Kumar Ajay, professor at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, USA on Thursday. 

Dr Ajay was addressing a webinar on ‘Therapeutics, vaccination and new normal’, organised by A N College, Patna. He said 296 trials were underway across the world for developing Covid-19 vaccine.

Interacting with the teachers and researchers of the college, Dr Ajay admitted that food habits, regular use of spices and turmeric and lesser luxurious life contributed to keep the immunity of Indians at a level higher than many western countries. 

He said while vaccines against bird flu, swine flu and Ebola virus have already been developed, those against SARS (severe acute respiratory system), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), H7N9 and Zika viruses were yet to come up. 

A N College principal S P Shahi said Covid-19 has ushered in a ‘new normal life’ characterised by lockdown, social distancing, home delivery of essential items, online classes and changed lifestyle with masks covering half of the faces.

Several teachers interacted with the US expert. While Ratna Amrit coordinated the webinar, prominent among those participating in the interaction included Preety Sinha, Tripti Gangwar, Shailesh Singh and Nupur Bose.
