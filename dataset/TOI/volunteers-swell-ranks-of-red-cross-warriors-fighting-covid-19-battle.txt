Volunteers swell ranks of Red Cross warriors fighting Covid-19 battle
2020-04-14
GUNTUR: For volunteers at Red Cross, a typical day during this lockdown begins at 4am. They distribute food to the destitute, deliver essential commodities, medicines to the aged and masks and sanitisers to frontline warriors. They are relentlessly working to help people stay at home and stay safe.


While the volunteers are sweating it out in the scorching heat, the organisation heads of Red Cross Guntur unit are spending sleepless nights to keep the stocks ready by dawn. 

Among them are billionaire industrialist Penmatsa Ramachandra Raju, who is playing the role of the chairman of the disaster management team. Raju is usually the first person to reach the Red Cross office at 4.30am and also the last person to leave after completing relief operations. Attending to dozens of calls from people in need, including doctors and nurses, deputing his armies to the field and prevailing upon philanthropists to do their bit make up Raju’s daily schedule.

Other such persons are international director of Rotary and Red Cross chairman Vadlamani Ravi, BJP city wing leader Jupudi Rangaraaju, Red Cross state wing treasurer GYN Babu and advisor SVS Lakshminarayana who are using their resources to mobilise donations and stocks to help the needy in the crisis time.

“I am proud of my volunteers who are relentlessly working without taking a penny from the organisation,” said Raju. 

Around 100-110 volunteers have joined the Red Cross WhatsApp group. They take down instructions from Raju to move to different locations. While some of them collect items such as masks, sanitisers, food packets and fruits from the office, a few others go to markets and rythu bazaars ensure that people queue up and follow social distancing. They also spread awareness about Covid-19. 

Interestingly, at least 10 young girls have also joined the Red Cross.
