Visakhapatnam: District health authorities are mulling extention of home quarantine period to 28 days following two recent cases where patients tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) even after being in quarantine for 14 days. 

The officials also plan to begin aggressive testing from Friday using rapid testing kits received from South Korea.

On Wednesday night, a 27-year-old woman from the red zone of Thatichetlapalem, who was under strict home quarantine for nearly 20 days, tested positive for Covid-19. On April 3, her three family members who had tested positive were admitted, treated and have been discharged. One of the members had a travel history to Mumbai. However, none of them has shown any sign of relapse.

Another woman, a Delhi returnee, who had tested negative in early April, tested positive on Sunday almost after 14 days. She was already in the quarantine centre at Sheelanagar.

Dr PV Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College and member of various district Covid-19 control committees, said, “Earlier, the symptoms or positive cases could be detected within five to 10 days and therefore 14-day home quarantine was mandatory. But the recent cases show that one can test positive even after 14 days or even three weeks. Therefore, to avoid any risk of spreading, the district administration and health officials are planning to extend the mandatory quarantine period to 28 days.”

“We will also conduct more tests with the rapid test kits from South Korea, which have been checked for accuracy and are not faulty like the Chinese ones. These kits can test both IgM and IgG antibodies,” Dr Sudhakar added.
