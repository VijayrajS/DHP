Don’t expect lockdown to totally end after April 15; all patients may go to 4 hospitals: Maharashtra minister
2020-04-07
MUMBAI: Given the high incidence of Covid-19 positive patients in Mumbai and Pune, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said, “No one should assume that the lockdown will be entirely lifted after April 15.”


Tope said the government will minutely monitor the situation between April 10 and April 15. “The state government will take a decision on lifting the lockdown depending on the situation, Central government advisory and WHO guidelines.”

Tope further said the state is actively considering shifting all patients in Mumbai to Kasturba, Seven Hills, Saifee and Nanavati hospitals. With civic employees striking work at V N Desai Hospital in Santacruz and Trauma Care Hospital at Jogeshwari and nurses’ unions demanding personal protective equipment, the state seems to have decided not to exacerbate the situation. “All Covid-19 patients will be shifted to these hospitals,” he said. These hospitals have about 2,300 beds in all.

The state government has sought 3.25 lakh PPE kits, nine lakh N-95 masks, 99 lakh triple layer masks and 1,200 ventilators from the Centre, said Tope. “Though there are adequate resources available at the state level, as a precautionary measure and in the event of an emergency, the state has asked for additional equipment from the Centre,” added the health minister. 

The Central government has asked all states not to purchase any type of equipment related to Covid-19 that will be supplied by the Centre. Currently, the state has 35,000 PPE kits, three lakh N-95 masks, 1,300 ventilators and 20 lakh triple layer masks, he said.

On Sunday, Tope met heads of Hazrat Nizamuddin Tabligi sect, seeking help to urge those who attended the Markaz in Delhi to cooperate with authorities. The leaders urged community members to ignore false messages and maintain harmony.
