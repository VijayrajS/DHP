A circular issued by the registrar general said that the HC has decided to cut down on functioning for two weeks for safety of people and to assist efforts undertaken by the apex court and the governments to curb the spread of coronavirus. 

The HC will take up urgent matters only. It will hear only those matters which it thinks urgent at its discretion. On absence of lawyers and litigants, no adverse orders will be passed. The effect of interim orders will continue for next two weeks. The Bar room, library and canteen in the HC campus at Sola have been ordered to be closed by 1 pm daily. Lawyers have been advised not to gather in large number outside courtrooms.

Before this circular, the bar councils had urged the chief justice either to close all courts or to restrict court functions to urgent cases only for next two weeks in wake of the coronavirus outbreak. 

A member of the Bar Council of India, Dilip Patel, wrote to the chief justice to stop court functioning for two weeks, given that the government too has stalled various activities including functioning of education institutes. 

Meanwhile, the Bar Council of Gujarat also urged the chief justice and the HCâ€™s registrar general to direct all courts across the state to restrict their work to urgent cases only. The courts may take up bail proceedings and other urgent cases and filing of new cases and proceedings on pending trials can be postponed for certain period in larger public interest.
