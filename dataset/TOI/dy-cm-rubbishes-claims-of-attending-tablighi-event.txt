Deputy CM rubbishes claims of attending Tablighi event
2020-04-02
TIRUPATI: Following allegations that deputy chief minister SB Amzath Basha had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event at Markaz Nizamuddin in Delhi between March 15-17 which has since emerged as a hotspot of Covid-19 cases, Amzath Basha on Wednesday clarified that he was not in the national capital at the time.


The deputy CM said the allegations were part of a conspiracy by some sections of the media to corner him and the state government. “I will not take this mischief lightly. It is unfortunate that lies are being spread about my visit to Delhi. I had gone to the national capital, but it was in connection with a case in the Supreme Court on March 2. I stayed at Andhra Bhavan and returned to the state capital the next day and attended a cabinet meet,” Basha said.

“Being a VVIP, every movement of mine is recorded by protocol and I have nothing to hide. As a responsible minister, if I had attended the religious congregation, I would have voluntarily got myself tested. But there is no truth in the media reports that I attended the Delhi event,” he added.

The deputy CM also told reporters that he would file criminal cases and defamation suits against the media outlets that have made the allegations.
