Kolhapur: The first four ‘index patients’ from Islampur, in Sangli district, had tested negative for Covid-19 on Sunday. 

Sangli guardian minister Jayant Patil said that the news comes as a relief. 

The tests on the remaining 21 family members will also be done soon, as they near the end of their 14-day quarantine period. 

The health of all the patients is said to be stable as they are recuperating at the Miraj Government Medical College (GMC).

Abhijeet Chaudhary, the district collector of Sangli, told TOI: “The patients will be kept at institutional quarantine facility in Sangli. Their health will be regularly monitored. However, there will not be any more tests unless any of them develop symptoms again. The remaining family members, who near the end of their 14-day quarantine period, will also go through the same tests and will be shifted to the same institutional facility as these four.”

He added that these tests were done at the newly installed laboratory at the Miraj GMC, where samples from other districts too are being tested. tnn
