PM Modi to address NAM on India's Covid-19 strategy
2020-05-04
PM Narendra Modi will participate Monday in a virtual Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit meant to discuss ways to jointly fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. While the PM has repeatedly underscored the significance of international collaboration in combating the virus, the presence of Modi at NAM will still have some novelty value, as he has avoided attending NAM summits in the past, marking as many have said a significant departure in India's foreign policy.


Modi became the first full-time Indian PM to skip the NAM summit in 2016. He did it again in 2019, in a decision seen as confirming India's move from non-alignment to what is described these days by Indian authorities as multi-alignment.

"One has to keep in mind though that this is not the usual NAM summit. It is a virtual meeting and will see participation from a limited number of member states," said a source.

Modi is expected to outline India's Covid-19 strategy in a statement at the meeting.

Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, who is the current NAM chairman, will chair the meeting. 

United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres and WHO DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus are also expected to address the summit which is titled "United Against Covid-19".

A diplomatic source said the summit was expected to underline the significance of multilateralism in addressing the challenges faced by NAM countries in dealing with the virus.

Modi is expected to highlight that, in these challenging times, India has remained responsible in living up to our international commitments, as MEA has repeatedly said. This is most obvious in the way it has handled demands from all over the world for HCQ tablets and other medicines.

India has so far provided 2.8 million HCQ tablets as grant assistance to 25 countries. In addition, consignments of HCQ and of paracetamol are being sent to 87 countries on a commercial basis.
