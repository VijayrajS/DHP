 "The tour guide may be a resident of Noida, but he got the virus outside Noida when he was with Italian tourists in Jaipur. He operates out of Delhi, where he has an office and where he has been quarantined. Technically, he didn't get infected in Noida. But since he is a resident, he may be counted in Noida's database for coronavirus infections," said chief medical officer of Gautam Budh Nagar, Anurag Bhargava. "It's an administrative matter and has nothing to do with the spread of the disease," he added. 


The resident of Nithari Sector 31, the guide is under observation. Blood samples of his wife and nephew, whom he had met in Noida after returning from Jaipur, have been collected.

The Gautam Budh Nagar health department has tracked 463 people of the 492 travellers identified by the health ministry and the AAI as those who need to be tested. So far, 147 samples have been collected - 102 have tested negative and 45 are pending. In Ghaziabad, 32 samples have been collected so far. "Of those, 18 have tested negative, 13 are pending and one has tested positive," said NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.

On Wednesday, a woman from the trans-Hindon area met Gupta after she suspected she had been infected. "She told us she had come in contact with an affected person. She has been quarantined at MMG Hospital and samples sent for testing," said Gupta.
