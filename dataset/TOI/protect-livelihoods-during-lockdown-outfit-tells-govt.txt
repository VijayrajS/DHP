Protect livelihoods during lockdown, outfit tells govt
2020-05-17
Coimbatore: Members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) on Saturday protested at several places in the city, urging the state to safeguard the livelihoods of people who have lost jobs to the nation-wide lockdown. They said the financial assistance of Rs 1,000 was not sufficient for two months of lockdown.

They protested at around 30 places in the city, by ensuring physical distancing.

Pointing out that many people haven’t had any jobs or means to livelihood for the past 50 days, Raja Husain, a district representative of SDPI, said, “The aid of Rs 1,000 would in no way be sufficient for running their families. Instead of helping the people with their livelihood, the state is now opening Tasmac outlets.”

He said there was a tendency among both the Centre and state to spread hate against a particular community during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Centre has not provided the required funds and GST dues to the state.”

Husain said the BJP government at the Centre has been undermining the state’s rights under the cover of lockdown. “The state’s right in the Cauvery riparian issue has been undermined as the Centre has taken a decision to bring the Cauvery Water Management Authority under the Union Jal Shakti Ministry.”

The protesters also condemned the Centre’s move of using the lockdown to persecute activists under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act.
