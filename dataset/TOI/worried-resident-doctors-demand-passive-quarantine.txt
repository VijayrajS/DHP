Worried resident doctors demand passive quarantine
2020-05-19
Lucknow: KGMU authorities had a tough time convincing its 25 resident doctors at Queen’s Mary Hospital who were demanding to be sent to ‘passive quarantine’ after being exposed to Covid-19 risk while performing a surgery on a patient who later tested positive.

On Monday, the 25 resident doctors wrote to KGMU saying their team examined the patient without proper protective gear and a nurse has already tested positive.

“As per WHO’s definition, we are high risk contacts. We came in direct physical contact of the patient, or touched her linen or came within three feet distance without protection,” they wrote, and added “WHO recommends 14-day quarantine for anyone in such a scenario, but we are still working and that too under fear of catching infection.”

KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said senior professors, including a microbiologist, explained residents that all protective measures are being taken and they will be tested again after five days. “These doctors are in ‘active quarantine’, which means they have to work, but cannot go home or mingle with others. It is same as serving in Covid-19 ward for seven days before being sent for 14-day quarantine,” said an officer.

Meanwhile, on government’s order, a committee comprising SGPGIMS, RMLIMS and KGMU representatives started probing whether safety protocols were followed in the said surgery or not. KGMU VC Prof. MLB Bhatt said, “The decision on residents’ demand will be taken as per the committee’s report, which will also suggest any improvements in existing protocols.”
