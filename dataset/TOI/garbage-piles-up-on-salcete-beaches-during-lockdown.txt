Garbage piles up on Salcete beaches during lockdown
2020-04-09
COLVA: The state tourism department continues to remain a silent spectator even as garbage keeps piling up along the popular coastal belt in Salcete.


Last week, TOI highlighted that dry waste was left unattended by Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC), the agency contracted by the state government to clean the beach. Director of tourism department Menino D’Souza had said there was a problem because travel passes could not be issued by the district administration as movement of vehicles was restricted due to lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic.

However, the situation along the Colva-Benaulim stretch has worsened over the weekend. The entire stretch is lined up with plastic and glass bottles, pieces of nylon ropes, bags, slippers, syringes and many other items, giving it a very messy look. “The beach is being cleaned and garbage must have been brought in due to high tide,” said D’Souza.

When pointed out that the garbage has been there since March 30, the director said work is in progress.

With India’s fight against the pandemic forcing a national 21-day lockdown and movement restricted, these are difficult times for everyone, said the director, assuring that the garbage would be cleared.
