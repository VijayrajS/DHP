KHTS offers service villas for 14-day quarantine
2020-05-15
Kochi: Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society (KHTS) has approached the state government with a plan to open up ‘service villas’ and homestays as quarantine facilities.

“In every district, there are paid service villas which are independent units with just a receptionist and a cook. The government can use these facilities at a lower cost for families or individuals in self-quarantine,” said M P Shivadattan, president of KHTS.

He said that every district is looking for such facilities. “We can’t rent them out anyway,” he added. Only owners who have a second home or who are able to stay at their relatives' house during this period can offer such facilities.

The state has proposed a number of options for self-isolation or quarantine of individuals or families returning from abroad or other states. “We have had discussions in our group and identified about 50 rooms that can be used. Our team has also held discussions with the Kannur district collector,” said E V Haris, KHTS Kannur.

The self-quarantine programme is arranged in such a manner that all requirements for guests during their stay are prearranged and do not need the physical presence of the host family or staff. The host family will provide 24-hour water, electricity, and online help desk and guidance. Neither host nor staff members will be present at the accommodation. If required, food arrangements can be made with support from local Kudumbashree units. KHTS has suggested a single rent rate for all service villas and homestays irrespective of user ratings, size and facilities provided.
