2020-03-06
VADODARA: The city seems to be breathing easy for now with no suspicious cases of COVID-19 being reported even as persons elsewhere in the state have been admitted to hospitals and their samples collected for tests. 


Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) health department officials are keeping a close tab on persons who have travelled to the city from countries that are facing the viral outbreak. So far, VMC officials said, 222 people from the city who were either staying in the affected countries or had visited them have returned. 

Out of these, 34 people were kept under observation and advised to isolate themselves at home for two weeks. Of these 34 people, the two-week period was over for 29 even as five were still under observation. So far, even these five people have not shown any symptoms of the disease.

VMC officials said there was no reason to panic presently. They added that the SSG Hospital that had been designated as a treatment centre had no suspicious cases of fever so far. 

Hospital sources said there were some persons who were walking in to get themselves examined. These included even those who had no history of travel to the affected countries or contact with those who may have returned from such nations.
