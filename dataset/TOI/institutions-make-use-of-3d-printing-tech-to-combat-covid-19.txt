Mangaluru: Three dimensional (3D) printing, which is otherwise used for academic and other related purposes, at educational institutions, is now helping to combat Covid-19.

Several educational institutions in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts have turned to 3D printing technology to combat Covid-19. Manipal Academy of Higher Education, National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) Surathkal and Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, among others, have been using this technology to manufacture various equipment, to fight the pandemic. Medical equipment such as face shields, respirator masks, ventilator manifolds and no touch sanitary tools have been manufactured by these institutions. 

“When the lockdown was announced, our 3D printing machines used for research, became free. We started brainstorming on how to put these machines to use to fight Covid-19, and the result was that we started manufacturing faceshields, 3D printed masks, ventilator splitters and connectors. Faculty members and research scholars developed the technology using open resources. Only two faculty members were on campus and the rest helped remotely,” explains Gangadharan K V, coordinator, NITK Centre for System Design (CSD). The splitter for ventilator was 3D printed at different places. NITK Centre for System Design printed the first prototype and got it tested at Mangalore K S Hegde Hospital at (Nitte deemed to be university). “We have now designed technology to manufacture 3D face masks. The production cost is high, and we will only produce them when there is an emergency need,” he added. So far, NITK Surathkal has supplied hundreds of face shields to MRPL, NMPT and other institutions.
