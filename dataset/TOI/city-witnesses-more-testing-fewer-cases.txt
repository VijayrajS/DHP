2020-04-14
AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials on Monday said that compared to the very high figures recorded for positive cases detected in the city last week, the figures of past two days is comparatively low primarily due to the high number of tests conducted in close-knit clusters to detect more cases.


AMC officials said that after the high of 58 cases recorded in a single day on April 9, the cases are constantly on decline.




The positive cases on Monday included both from the identified clusters where the concentration of positive cases and those who had come in contact with them is higher and newer areas. Senior state health officials said that as part of the new strategy, all persons in clusters with any medical symptoms would be tested with the view that those with lower immunity have higher risk of viral infection.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare), stated that as part of strategy, they are also going to carry out random sampling in areas outside of clusters and parts of the state from where no cases are recorded so far to make sure whether there are no cases, or the positive cases have not been identified yet. As on Monday evening, Ahmedabad district has cumulatively tested 5,943 samples, which consists of 41.7% of total testing in the state.

“Check-posts are also now proving to be a valuable source to identify persons with any symptoms quickly. Moreover, we are coordinating with hospitals, services like EMRI 108 ambulances and private practitioners to report every severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) immediately so that the persons can be tested quickly,” said an official, adding that it’s often seen that if the case comes at a later stage, chances of survival gets reduced.
