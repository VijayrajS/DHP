2020-02-08
Trichy: Computer virus produced by human ingenuity can be more harmful than biological viruses, said Prateep V Philip, DGP civil supplies, CID, Chennai.He was speaking at a two-day workshop on Cyber Security, online verification and fact-checking organised by Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN) that concluded here on Friday.Saying that every day 200,000 malwares are introduced into the net which is more harmful than any biological virus, he asked aspiring media professionals of CUTN to be committed to the integrity of data to counter this challenge.Coronavirus is one of many viruses that keep mutating and every year we see a new virus. But the kind of virus and malware human ingenuity produces is far greater than biological virus, he said. He said that every day 200,000 are launched into network systems around the world and that makes the netizens prone to virus attack.“It is far more pervasive than coronavirus, as it can be brought under control through strict measures. “But computer related virus is multiplying, and everyday human ingenuity is creating new forms of cybercrime and every one of us must have come across cyberattack of one kind or another,” he said.The problem of too much information (TMI) and too little insight has been an issue, he said. While many world leaders are affected by fake news, he said we all become experts overnight by reading the shared fake news on social media which are hitting us at rapid rate.“We have no control over fake news in social media platforms. We keep getting invaded by new dimensions of very burning issues around the world and we have no way of filtering it,” he said.Asking students to analyse news with right perspective by developing an insight, he said it is only then we will be able to analyse news with the right perspective so that it will not be harmful for readers.There are people who invent new methods to use ICT to harm others, if not physically, their reputation and, also to commit fraud. A fact will remain fact and one cannot embellish it. But ICT has revolutionised the world and shrunk human mind.Online verification, fake news and cyber security have ramification with each other. In this uncertain and ambiguous world, he said there is a need to develop commitment among youngsters on integrity of data to face the challenge.
