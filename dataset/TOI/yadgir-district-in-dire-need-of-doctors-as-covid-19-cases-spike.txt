Hubballi: Yadgir district in dire need of doctors as Covid-19 cases spike
2020-05-25
YADGIR: The sudden jump in Covid cases across Yadgir district is a cause for worry due to the acute shortage of doctors.

Although the administration says it's prepared to handle the increasing number of coronavirus cases, the authorities have started making alternative arrangements to treat critical patients. There are no specialists in government hospitals and hospitals are functioning with just 50% of sanctioned posts.

To make matters worse, 72 persons who returned from Maharashtra tested positive on Saturday. This is a record daily jump yet for any district in the state. On Sunday, 24 more cases were reported, taking the total to 111.

The district administration has arranged over 800 beds, which, going by the current rate of rise in cases, should be enough. Officials say the health department has been anticipating a surge as people from neighbouring states were expected to return. Many people from the district migrate to Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to seek work. As per labour department data, 14,500 workers have returned from various states.

As there are no specialists to handle critical cases that need ventilators, the administration has tied up with Kalaburagi ESI (Employees’ State Insurance) Hospital. Deputy commissioner M Kurma Rao said: "We're issuing a notification again to recruit doctors. The district has been facing an acute shortage of doctors for many years.” Kurma Rao said three notifications have been issued but only two candidates applied. He did not reveal the number of sanctioned posts and vacancies.

He said critical cases would be sent to Kalaburagi ESI Hospital. Based on the condition of patients and their comorbidities, a decision about shifting patients would be taken. A health official said there's not much cause for worry as most patients are asymptomatic.
