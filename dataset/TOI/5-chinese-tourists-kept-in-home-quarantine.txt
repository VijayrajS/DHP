Jaipur: Five Chinese tourists, who were found staying in a house in the Walled City area, have been kept in home quarantine after the health authorities conducted their screening for Covid-19.

In the curfew-bound Walled City area, the health department, while conducting door-to-door survey, discovered that some Chinese tourists are staying in a house in Chandi Ki Taxal area. The neighbours told the health department team that they have been staying in the house for the past one month.

The health department teams kept asking them to come out of the house, but they did not open the door, a neighbour told TOI. The neighbour said there was one Nepal national, who is accompanying them.

However, the health department team called Manak Chowk police, who rushed to the spot and persuaded the Chinese tourists to come out of the house and cooperate with the health authorities.

“They reached India on January 29 and landed at Delhi airport. They are Chinese tourists and first they stayed in Delhi and they went to Udaipur and reached Jaipur, one month ago,” said Jitendra Singh, station house officer, Manak Chowk.

Police and the health department teams called an ambulance and they were taken to SMS Hospital where the doctors conducted their screening for Covid-19. “In the screening, the doctors did not find anything to worry about. Since they have come from China, the health department have kept them in home quarantine,” Singh said.

Police said that they are residents of Henan province, which is 500km away from Wuhan, the epicenter of Covid-19 outbreak.

After medical checkup, the health department dropped them at the house, where they will be kept in home quarantine for at least 14 days.
