Covid-19 scare: Early negative test is not final, day 5 and 14 results key, says BMC

MUMBAI: People who have returned from abroad must quarantine themselves, say BMC health officials as Mumbai has the most cases of Covid-19 in the state. A majority have shown no symptoms of Covid-19 and many of those who have undergone the test but tested negative have also been advised to quarantine themselves at home.

“Merely because they have shown no symptoms or tested negative by no means indicates they are clear,” said officials at Mumbai’s Kasturba laboratory, which till a few days ago was the only centre for Covid-19 testing.

What it really means is that there is a possibility that they may have just contracted the coronavirus (Day 1 or Day 2). The viral load required for detection may not have sufficiently built up and hence would not show up in the tests. “There may not be enough viral load to enable detection. This viral load will build up by Day 4-5,” said Dr Jayanti Shastri, head, Kasturba molecular lab. Dr Shastri said equipment used for Covid-19 testing are very sensitive and with a good limit of detection (LOD).

But presence of the virus in a person may be even lower than LOD and so it does not get detected. “By Day 4-5, the viral load in a person will build up. Patients tested should be vigilant about symptoms,” she said.

Even if this does not show positive, it does not mean the person is in the clear. There are at least two instances where people have tested positive on the 14th day, and hence the need for the compulsory 14-day quarantine. In Bhutan, a US woman tourist tested negative three times but on the fourth test on the 14th day tested positive. In many buildings, residents are stressed that those returning from abroad are not self-isolating.

BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi said many do not exhibit symptoms when they arrive and may not even be infected, but it is out of abundant precaution that BMC asks them to quarantine themselves and gives them the advantage of being quarantined at home rather than at a civic quarantine hospital.

Singer Kanika Kapoor, who returned from London last week, instead of being quarantined chose to socialise in the interim period. “Initial negative result does not mean free of virus. Hence quarantine of 14 days is important,” she said.
