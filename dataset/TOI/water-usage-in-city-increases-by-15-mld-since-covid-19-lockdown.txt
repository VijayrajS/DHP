NASHIK: The water consumption in the city has increased from 500 to over 515 million litres per day (MLD) since the lockdown was imposed one-and-a-half months back, said NMC officials on Tuesday. 


Due to Covid-19 outbreak and ongoing summer, the usage of water has increased. “There has been a lot of commercial establishments that are closed due to lockdown. But despite this, the consumption of water has increased in the city as residents are using more water for hygiene and cleanliness purposes in wake of the Covid-19,” said an NMC official. 

According to the official, the increase in water usage has been approximately 15 MLD. “As everyone is at home due to lockdown the usage has gone up. That is also one of the reasons behind the increase in daily water usage,” said the official. 

Till December 2019, the water usage in the city increased to 500 MLD. “This has been because of the rise in population in the city, particularly those migrating to the city in search of work. Moreover, new residential societies and eateries in the city are also emerging gradually. This has overall led to a rise in consumption of water in the city,” added the official.

Gangapur dam is the major source of water to the city as it provides 80 percent of the total water. The NMC arranges the remaining water from Darna and Mukane dams.

Earlier, the NMC had demanded of 5,000 mcft of water for the city for a period between October 15 last year and July 31 this year. This includes 3,600 mcft of water from Gangapur dam complex, 400 mcft from Darna and 1,000 mcft from Mukane dam.

Last year, NMC had water reservation of 4,900 mcft of water, including 4,200 mcft of water from Gangapur dam, 400 mcft from Darna and 300 mcft of water from the Mukane dam.

The city currently has 1.96 lakh water connections, including 1.87 lakh residential, while 4,000 connections are commercial and remaining 5,000 are non-commercial.
