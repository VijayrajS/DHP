2020-06-07
CHENNAI: As Tamil Nadu’s Covid-19 tally breached the 30,000 mark on Saturday, hospitals in Chennai struggled to accommodate patients. Chennai accounted for 1,146 of the 1,458 fresh cases that took the state tally to 30,152. The state also recorded 19 deaths, the highest daily toll so far, taking the total to 251.


Several people in Chennai, which now has a total of 20,993 cases, made desperate calls and tweeted on social media about shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients. “My aunt is 80-years-old and tested positive. We called most private hospitals we knew but we just couldn’t find a bed,” said Shridharan S, a retired banker, who lives in Teynampet. Private hospitals said they were running out of ICU beds as people with comorbidities, elderly and the sick who require high dependency units, are being brought in. At government hospitals, doctors were moving several patients with no or mild symptoms to Covid-19 care centres. “We are still full,” a senior doctor said. Senior intensivists and infectious diseases experts from at least four Chennai hospitals told TOI they were seeing many patients, being brought to hospital too late.

 

Of 13,503 patients being treated, 10,223 in Chennai

Saturday’s list of fatalities included a 30-year-old man with no-comorbidities, who died within 10 minutes of admission at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Thursday following a massive cardiopulmonary arrest. Eight of the nineteen patients whose deaths were reported on Saturday did not have any comorbidities.

While it took two weeks for the state to move from 10,000 cases to 20,000 cases, it added another 10,000 cases in just 8 days. Chennai was growing at a much faster rate. While it took 11 days for the city to double its cases from 5,000, it moved to 15,000 cases in eight days and added another 5000 cases in just five days. At the end of the day, 633 patients were discharged taking the total number of people discharged to 16,395. There were 13,503 patients still being treated, including 10,223 in Chennai.

tests also went up as the state increased the number of people it was testing. In the last 24 hours, the state has tested 15,389 people and 16,022 samples across 74 labs.

As the number of tests increased, it was taking up to five days to get results, though lab technicians were working overtime Among Chennai’s neighbouring districts, Chengalpet reported 95 cases, Kancheepuram 16, and Tiruvallur 79. The remaining 84 cases were from 24 districts –14 in Tuticorin alone.
