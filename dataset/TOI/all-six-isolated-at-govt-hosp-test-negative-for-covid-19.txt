COIMBATORE: The public health department on Wednesday confirmed that all the six people, who were admitted at the isolated ward at Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), tested negative for Covid-19. 


The swab samples of a 35-year-old man from Udumalpet with travel history to Singapore, a 67-year-old woman with travel history to Kottayam, two French nationals, a teenager from Mettupalayam and a resident of Cheranmanagar were sent to the King Institute in Chennai for tests. 

Public health department officials confirmed that all the six patients tested negative. 

The 35-year-old man from Udumalpet landed in the city from Singapore last week. 

Since he had fever and symptoms of flu, he was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital on Monday. 

The 67-year-old woman from Valparai had visited Kottayam last week. She was suffering from a cold and fever since then and wanted to get tested. 

The 15-year-old boy from Mettupalayam had returned from the UAE and had low grade fever on and off for the past 10 days. He had high fever for the past two days. The two French nationals reached the district on Tuesday evening for Ayurveda treatment at a centre and were referred to the CMCH.

When asked about news reports that at least three more people had approached CMCH with symptoms of Covid-19 and local travel history, dean of the hospital Dr B Ashokan said he did not know about any such cases.
