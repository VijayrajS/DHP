No relaxation in lockdown in Beed, Latur stays cautious
2020-04-21
Aurangabad: Even as the government has allowed relaxation in certain lockdown-related rules, Beed district collector Rahul Rekhawar on Monday said nothing in the district will change without the order from the district administration. 

"The state government has given freedom to all district administrations vide notification dated April 17," he said, adding that the precaution aims at negating the possibility of Covid-19 spread to zero.

Beed district has witnessed only one confirmed case so far with the district administration employing several proactive measures to contain the spread of the viral disease. 

Among different initiatives, the district administration had announced odd-even formula for towns for buying of essentials during the lockdown and also curtailed the operation time of establishments supplying essential items for only four hours.

Among other districts of Marathwada, Latur has also decided to exercise caution. Latur district guardian minister Amit Deshmukh, while addressing a meeting of the district administration, asked for strict sealing of district boundaries until further notice. 

Deshmukh, who represents Latur assembly constituency, has also asked for increasing the check posts at the entry points in the city and at other local self-governing bodies of the district in order to keep a tight vigil on the movement of outsiders. 

Latur had reported eight Covid-19 patients with none of them having local roots and all were on a journey to their homes in the southern India.
