HYDERABAD: At a time when the government is trying to keep the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) in check, Sirpur-Kagaznagar MLA Koneru Konappa was exempted from the mandatory quarantine. The legislator, who returned from the United States on Wednesday, was allowed by state health authorities to go to his assembly constituency and move about freely.


This, as passengers coming from foreign countries are being moved to mandatory quarantine for a period of 14 days.

 
The TRS MLA along with his wife had returned on Wednesday and reached Kagaznagar by train that afternoon itself. He attended the municipal council meeting of Kagaznagar municipality and also attended a programme along with his wife and 108 staffers at Venkateshwara Swamy temple at Ganugampuram in Asifabad district. The legislator was not seen wearing a mask and is also said to have met several people at his residence and outside to address grievances.

Interestingly, municipal administration principal secretary Arvind Kumar, who came back from the USA is under home quarantine for the past six days despite testing negative for coronavirus, both the at the airport and at Gandhi Hospital. He has not been attending any official meetings.

Union minister of state V Muraleedharan is under self-quarantine after he visited a medical institution in Kerala where a doctor was tested positive after his return from Spain while BJP MP Suresh Prabha is also under self-quarantine after he returned from Saudi Arabia on March 10.

When contacted MLA Koneru Konappa confirmed that he had come back from the US on Wednesday morning and attended the council meeting and the temple programme. The legislator said that he was tested negative at the airport and district health officials had checked him and the report was negative. “I thought when the tests were negative there was no need for quarantine,” the MLA said.
