However, the conmen are also taking advantage of the same and have started contacting people via phones and emails, and conning them by some or the other pretext,” a police officer said.“People who approached us immediately after being cheated got their money back as we could immediately execute the stop transaction process after contacting the concerned nodal officers of the banks,” he added.The officer said they have also set up a media cell to maintain vigil on rumours, fake news and messages being spread of various social media platforms that could cause enmity between two communities. A total 18 cases were registered and 32 people were arrested for such offences .
