SURAT: In order to help people suffering from coronavirus fears and Covid-19 positive patients, the Surat branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has set up an action committee and issued round-the-clock helpline numbers where people can take doctors’ advice on issues related to coronavirus. 



 
“We have issued an advisory for common people as well as doctors. People have little information about the coronavirus and they are panicky due to its fast spread. However, we want to tell people not to panic and take precautions with the help of doctors,’’ said Dr Parul Vadgama, president, IMA’s Surat branch. TNN
