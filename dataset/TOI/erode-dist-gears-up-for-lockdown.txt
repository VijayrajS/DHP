Erode district gears up for lockdown
2020-03-23
Even as the health department was awaiting the test results of 10 people who came in contact with the two Thai nationals tested positive for Covid-19 in Erode, the district administration geared up for a lock down.

Erode was one of the three districts in Tamil Nadu identified by the Centre for a lockdown to prevent Coronavirus from spreading.

Erode collector C Kathiravan said that a decision on sealing the borders of the district will be taken by the chief minister on Monday. “The Government of India’s direction on locking down certain districts including Erode is under the consideration of the state government. So, the status quo will remain until the decision is taken. For now, the district will function as usual after the curfew ends at 5am on Monday,” he said.

However, police have placed barricades on the national highway at Pallipalayam, the district border, which links Erode with Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri. The roads connecting Erode with Karnataka at Thimbam were sealed a day ago.

The collector also warned that all those coming to the district from abroad or other states should inform the tahsildar, block development officer or health officials in the locality. Those failing to intimate would face legal consequences. He also instructed the industrial units not to employ workers from other states or countries.

Meanwhile, a health officer said that 126 people who visited two mosques in Erode the Thai nationals visited are under medical surveillance and none of them have shown symptoms of Covid-19 yet.

Ten people, including a guide, driver and helpers of the Thai nationals, who came into close contact with them, are closely watched. The swab test results of the 10 was yet to come, the health officer said.TNN
