MANGALURU: Following the Covid-19 outbreak, international tourism has taken a hit and travel plans have been put on hold. Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts which are an education hub, attract many international students. Academicians are optimistic and are hoping that by the time the National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test (NEET- UG) is conducted, the situation will be under control.


Dr P Giridhar Kini, director, admissions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal, told TOI: “We do not foresee any impact of Covid-19 on international admissions. They are on schedule. The government of India is taking steps to contain the spread of the disease. We are sure that the situation will be fully under control by the time NRI students come to India to write the NEET examinations on May 3,” he said. 

At MAHE, the current strength of foreign and NRI students is more than 3,000. 

Dr Gangadhara Somayaji K S, registrar, Yenepoya (deemed to be university) said that it is too early to ascertain the impact of Covid-19 on international student admissions. The admission process has started and there is a possibility that people may be scared to travel. 

Similarly, the officials at the Nitte (deemed to be university) have not noticed major changes. Registrar Dr Alka Kulkarni said, “We have not noticed any difference in the number of enquiries that the institute has been receiving. For postgraduate admissions (medical and dental) there are no issues as the counselling process is online. For undergraduate students who will take NEET, there is still time, and we are hoping that the situation will be under control by then,” she said. 

Meanwhile, faculty from across colleges who had scheduled travel for seminars and conferences in places affected by Covid-19 have put their travel plans on hold. Many felt that a slowdown cannot be ruled out.
