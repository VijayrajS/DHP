MARGAO: Anxiety gripped the families of several Goan seafarers on Saturday following reports that among the 300 persons onboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, quarantined off the coast of Japan, several are Goans. By some estimates, up to 50 Goans are onboard.

Japanese authorities, it is learnt, have quarantined a large number of people onboard the ship as a preventive measure against coronavirus as the vessel is reported to have travelled to Japan from China.

Commissioner of NRI affairs Narendra Sawaikar said that while details are awaited, the Union government was keeping a close watch on the emerging situation. 

Union minister for external affairs S Jaishankar said that as per information from the Indian embassy, no Indian has tested positive. 

“Many Indian crew & some Indian passengers are onboard the cruise ship #DiamondPrincess quarantined off Japan due to #coronavirus. None have tested positive, as per the latest information provided by our Embassy @IndianEmbTokyo. We are closely following the developments,” minister for external affairs S Jaishankar posted on his Twitter account. 

Sawaikar responded to Jaishankar’s tweet stating that of the 300 Indians onboard the ship, 50 were Goans.

Dixon Vaz of the Goan Seafarers Association of India said that while information pertaining to the number of Goans aboard the shop was yet not known, he urged all seafarers joining the ships to carry with them sufficient face masks and protective gear.

Meanwhile, in a video that has been widely circulated, a person identifying himself as a crew member aboard Diamond Princess is seen urging PM Narendra Modi to intervene and save their lives.
