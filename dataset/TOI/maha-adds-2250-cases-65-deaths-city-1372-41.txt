2020-05-21
MUMBAI: For the fourth day in a row, Maharashtra on Wednesday added over 2,000 new Covid-19 cases (2,250), its second highest single-day count, taking the total cases close to the 40,000 mark (39,297). The state also reported 65 fatalities, its third highest toll for a day, taking the total deaths to 1,390. 

Mumbai, which too has added over 1,000 in the past four days, continues to be the major contributor of the cases. On Wednesday, 60% or 1,372 cases were reported from the city. The total cases in Mumbai now stand at 24,118, having breached the 24,000 mark and making up almost 25% of the country’s tally.

The city’s toll too rose by 41 – the joint second highest number of deaths recorded in a day – to reach 841, accounting for 25% of the country’s toll. However, civic officials said the 41 deaths included 15 that occurred between May 13 and 15. Even the daily tally of 1,372 cases includes 150 that tested positive between May 17 and 18. “These additions depend on time taken to complete death-related paperwork and the time we get Covid-19 reports from laboratories,” said a civic official. In 20 days of May, Mumbai has reported 551 deaths or 65% of its total deaths so far, which is an average of 27 deaths each day. The BMC update on Wednesday said 29 of the 41 dead were men and 12 women. While one of the victims was below 40 years of age, 18 were between 40 and 60 years old and the rest were over 60 years old. Most victims (32) had comorbidities.

“We found people who are over 60 and have comorbidities are the most vulnerable. In fact, we found almost 25% of victims had both diabetes and hypertension,” said BMC’s deputy executive health officer Dr Daksha Shah. Dr Shah said the city’s Covid graph looks steady. “We have a doubling rate of 13 days that has improved from 7 days in early April,” she said.

Many international cities saw an exponential rise in cases and deaths in the 8th or 9th week of the outbreak. Regarding the high number of deaths in May, a senior civic hospital doctor said it was the nature of the outbreak. “The virus is highly contagious. The deaths could be because of virulence of the strain or because some of them had heavy viral load,” said the doctor. Many victims were brought to hospital in a serious condition with high blood sugar levels. “Some came with a diabetes complication called diabetic acidosis,” said the doctor. 

Dharavi recorded 25 new cases, and officials said it was a sign of relief, apart from the low mortality rate there. Dharavi has reported 1,378 cases, with a mortality rate is around 4%. Thane recorded 110 cases, its highest single-day count so far, and 3 deaths. Those positive included 11 nurses from the state-run Thane civil hospital. Thane’s tally stands at 1,463 and the toll is 57. Kalyan recorded 3 deaths in 24 hours and 24 cases, taking the tally to 594, including 15 deaths.

The case fatalities in the state and city saw a marginal dip and were 3.53% and 3.48% respectively. Out of 65 dead, 46 were men and 19 women. 32 of them were aged over 60 years, 31 were from the age- group 40-59 and 2 were aged less than 40 years. 48 out of 65 patients (74%) had high-risk co-morbidities. On Wednesday, 679 people were discharged, taking the total number of people discharged to 10,318. Maharashtra as on Wednesday had a discharge rate of 26%, much lower than the national average of 39%.

Pune reported 13 deaths, 3 were reported in Navi Mumbai, and 2 each from Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Ulhasnagar and Aurangabad city.
