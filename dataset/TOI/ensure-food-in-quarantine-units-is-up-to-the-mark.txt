2020-04-15
Amaravati: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy directed collectors to ensure that food and facilities in quarantine units were up to the mark so that people would not think of escaping or rushing home. Moreover, primary and secondary contacts of the positive cases who are in quarantine should be made to feel safe and comfortable until they are discharged, he said.

Jaganmohan Reddy asked the officials to conduct rapid tests on all suspected cases identified by ANMs and ASHAs. He said shifting of high-risk cases to Covid-19 dedicated hospitals would help prevent deaths. TNN
