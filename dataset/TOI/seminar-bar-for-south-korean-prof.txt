Coronavirus scare: Seminar bar for South Korean professor at IIT-Kharagpur
2020-03-07
KOLKATA: A leading aviation expert from South Korea, who has been teaching at IIT-Kharagpur for a month and a half, was refused permission to attend an international seminar on Friday after the hosts developed cold feet over his nationality in the backdrop of the novel coronavirus scare in the Republic of Korea. Ironically, Prof CD Kong was the chief guest at the prestigious event organised jointly by the Aeronautical Society of India and IIT-Kharagpur’s aerospace department. 


Techno Main, the institute hosting the prestigious event, informed its decision to bar Kong from the Salt Lake Sector V campus late on Thursday night, barely hours before the seminar’s inauguration. Shocked and embarrassed, functionaries from AeSI and professors from IIT tried to reason with the institute’s officials and even requested MP Manish Gupta, a past chairman of the eastern region chapter of AeSI, to intervene. But the institute’s authorities refused to budge. 

“Kong had arrived from Seoul on January 18. So he has been here for over a month-and-a-half, well past the maximum quarantine period of 28 days,” said IIT-Kharagpur’s aerospace engineering professor DK Maity.

Techno Main principal Avijit Kar said the institute did not wish to take a chance after a government advisory against Chinese, South Korean, Iranian and Italian nationals who had arrived in India recently. “There is a lot of scare over nCoV. At a time like this, one has to be extra-cautious,” said Kar.

Forced to remain couped in a guest house, Kong addressed the seminar over Skype and gave a talk on urban aerial mobility. “It would have been nice to be present with everyone,” he said, before leaving for Seoul via Delhi on Friday afternoon.
