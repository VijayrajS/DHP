2020-04-05
NEW DELHI: Congress leader Ahmed Patel on Sunday urged home minister Amit Shah to allocate funds to states from the State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF) in proportion to the number of coronavirus cases they have reported.


Patel pointed out that some Union Territories and states like Delhi, Kerala and Punjab have a large number of Covid-19 cases but "they have received very little funds".

"I request the home minister Amit Shah to include Covid-19 as a criterion apart from the Finance Commission criteria for disbursement to states," he said on Twitter.

"Central Government must consider number of Covid-19 cases and hotspots to decide allocation of State Disaster Risk Management Fund to states," he added.
