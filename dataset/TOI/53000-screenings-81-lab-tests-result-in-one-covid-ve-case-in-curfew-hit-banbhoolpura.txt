NAINITAL: In the past three weeks since the Banbhoolpura area of Nainital district was declared a “Covid hotspot” by the district administration, the health department has screened 53,000 people and has sent 81 samples for testing in labs resulting in one Covid-19 case from this densely-populated locality.


According to the data provided by the district administration, till Sunday, 52,803 people from 9,135 families have been screened – through thermal checks and inquiring about Covid symptoms - since April 6. In total, 81 samples were sent from the locality for testing in labs, of which, just one was reported positive.

Speaking to TOI on Monday, Nainital district magistrate Savin Bansal confirmed that the one positive case from the area was reported last week and that the health department teams are still screening people from the area for symptoms. “Till now, we have screened over 9,000 families and are maintaining a strict vigil on the entire locality. Though some relief has been given during the curfew in the last few days and people have been allowed to get food or other essentials, we have maintained that people must follow the social distancing norms,” Bansal said.

As reported by TOI earlier, the area was sealed off on April 6 after five Covid cases were reported. All the cases were traced to the congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi. On April 13, a strict curfew was imposed in the area as rumours started doing the rounds on social media that local religious leaders were being taken to quarantine facility prompting hundreds of people to come on to the streets.

Meanwhile, on Sunday night, the district administration issued an order saying that it will screen all the people travelling to the district. The outsiders who belong to areas declared as “red” or “orange” zones who try to enter Nainital will be sent to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The order will imply to even the lockdown pass holders. The administration argued that the measure is necessary to contain the spread of the virus since there are strong possibilities that people travelling from the “red” and “orange” zones may be carrying it.
