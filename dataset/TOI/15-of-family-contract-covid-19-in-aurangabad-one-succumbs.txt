AURANGABAD: In Bahadurpura, Covid-19 has exacted a heavy price on a family. Fifteen members of the family contracted the infection, including an elderly woman who succumbed on Friday.

The virus had infected an elderly couple, their three sons, three daughters-in-law and five grandchildren. Moreover, the elderly couple’s Phulambri-based daughter and granddaughter also tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of affected family members to 15.

The elderly woman’s 27-year-old grandson said his grandmother was healthy before contracting the infection.

“My grandmother was the first to get infected in the family. She developed cold and cough about a fortnight ago. The family members consulted the nearest doctor, who failed to diagnose the early onset of Covid-19. Grandmother was rushed to a super-speciality hospital after her condition worsened, but the doctors there asked us to approach the state-run hospital. Her health continued to deteriorate even after getting admitted at the state-run hospital and she passed away on Friday,” he said.

The family had earlier made an official complaint to the CM’s office against the alleged poor treatment meted out to the elderly woman at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). 

“My grandmother complained to us over phone that there was nobody to take her to the latrine or the washroom at the hospital which anyway had poor hygiene. Later, she was admitted to the ICU. She was not aware that other members of the family, including children, have caught the infection,” he said.

The youngest son of the deceased woman lives at Pune, but he could not go to Aurangabad to perform the last rites. 

“While others are reading about the ever-increasing Covid-19 figures, we have felt the havoc the disease wreaks. As many as 14 of my close relatives are battling the disease and one has succumbed,” said the grandson.
