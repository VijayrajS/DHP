*Supply hitches left prices of some commodities unstable. 

*The egg price, for instance, has nosedived where supply is smooth. It remains dearer where supply line gets disrupted because of transportation issues. This is why egg price varies a lot from place to place. The egg price in Barisha, Behala, Khidderpore, Janbazar, Bhawnipore markets has cooled off significantly, with supply being steady.

However, in northern part of the city, like Dum Dum, Nagerbazar, Ultadanga or even further south like Garia, Patuli and Bagha Jatin, egg prices remained on the higher side on Sunday. But egg wholesalers assured that supply of egg to Kolkata has no issue. In the intra-city transportation, there are issues which need to be addressed.
