KOLKATA: Calcutta Club will be closed from March 21 for 10 days following in the wake of the city registering a couple of Covid-19 cases while Tolly Club will be 75% shut for the same period. Dalhousie Institute, another premier club, has decided to close operations from Sunday till further notice. Some other clubs of the city, like the Calcutta Rowing Club and Lake Club, will remain open though they have put restrictions on guests’ entry.


Promit Kumar Roy, committee member of Calcutta Club, told TOI that it has been closed from midnight on Friday. “We are the first club to do so to combat coronavirus,” he added. Roy pointed out that besides closing the club till March 31, there will be no social programme at the venue till April 15. According to him, the club will take a series of measures, like fuming and sanitization, during the closure.

The CEO of Tolly Club, Anil Mukerji, said that most of the activities of the club will be shut till March 31. “The guest rooms will be closed and all the AC bars and restaurants, too, will be shut,” he said. 

President of Dalhousie Institute Joyjeet Biswas said the club has decided to keep things open-ended rather than giving any date, like March 31, for reopening. “We want to reopen after the coronavirus threat is completely mitigated," he said.
