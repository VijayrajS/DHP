West Bengal: Belgachhia slums role models in coronavirus fight
2020-05-18
KOLKATA: The slums of Lal Maidan and Zarina Maidan in Belgachhia are all set to become a role model about how Kolkata Police and Kolkata Municipal Corporation plan to handle the Covid outbreak in the slums. 

This zone, which was one of the oldest slum containment areas in the city, was taken off the KMC containment list on Saturday after it did not report a fresh case in the past 22 days.

While it is no longer a containment zone, police and KMC will continue to mount medical surveillance for the next two months. This will include KMC taking random samples for testing and police ensuring that residents visit local fever clinic. 

In addition, cops will ask everyone to continue social distancing and police officers in the beat will be held responsible. Locals had approached the IPS officers in charge of this zone and appealed movement restriction be partially revoked instead of opening up the area all at once. “For now, grocery and sweet shops will remain open for a bit longer. But locals have asked me to ensure outsiders do not spread the disease,” said coordinator of the ward, Tarun Saha.

Cops said all general rules of Lockdown 4.0 will be implemented and night movement will be totally halted after 7pm. “The area’s containment zones have reduced from four to just one,” said an officer from the Ultadanga police station

“The overall lockdown implemented at Belgachhia became a model since the residents sincerely joined the effort. We blocked all entries to the slum. Initially when violations got reported, we decided to penetrate all the bylanes ,” said DC (ESD) Ajoy Prasad.
