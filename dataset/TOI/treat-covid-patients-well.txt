Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said all five recovered patients are willing to create awareness about the spread of coronavirus. He also said they should not be stigmatised in society. 

Sawant told mediapersons, “I have checked about their well-being, the facilities at quarantine centres and the health of their families,” he said. The chief minister said that all five persons should not be treated differently in society. “They are like us. Covid-19 is not a permanent disease,” he said. Stating that a few require counselling, Sawant said he has directed the health secretary to provide them with help. tnn
