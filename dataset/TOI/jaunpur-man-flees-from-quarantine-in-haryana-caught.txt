Varanasi: A 40-year-old man from Jaunpur, who worked as an auto driver in Mumbai, fled during lockdown in a truck and then from an isolation centre in Palwal, and left Haryana and UP Police sweating till he was traced.

Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Monday, “A man of Molnapur Sambhopur Khurd village under Saraikhwaja police station in Jaunpur district was working as auto driver in Mumbai since years. During lockdown, he managed to board a truck and was dropped by the driver at Palwal in Haryana last week but was caught and put in a quarantine centre where his sample was taken for test.”

The man managed to escape from the isolation centre in Palwal in Haryana before his test report arrived and reached his home in Jaunpur on Sunday morning.

When his report confirmed he had coronavirus infection, the officials in Haryana were left worried. Palwal police contacted Jaunpur officials following which Saraikhwaja police caught him from home and admitted him to the isolation ward of SSL hospital of BHU in Varanasi on Monday and lodged an FIR against him.

Senior sub-inspector of Saraikhwaja police station Shiv Prakash Verma said a team raided the village of the auto driver and caught him there.

Verma said an FIR was lodged against him under section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC, section 188 and appropriate sections of Epidemic Disease Act.

The officials started tracing the contacts of the man and found that besides his family members he had come in contact with many persons while travelling from Palwal to Jaunpur.
