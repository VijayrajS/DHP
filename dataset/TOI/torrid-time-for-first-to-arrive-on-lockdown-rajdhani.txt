Torrid time for first to arrive on lockdown Rajdhani
2020-05-15
Bhopal: Shooed away from the platform, futile haggling with cabbies out to fleece them, and a night sharing the footpath with strays – this was the fate of those who arrived in Bhopal on Tuesday midnight by the first Rajdhani of the lockdown bound for Bhilai.Their ordeal exposed the lack of preparedness of the administration and that Covid conditioning goes out of the window for a majority of train passengers when crowd instinct takes over.Chetan Bairagi, who arrived by the Rajdhani, says the night’s experience was traumatic. “I was stuck in Delhi for two months and was very excited when special trains were announced. My joy turned into a nightmare on arriving in Bhopal. If I had a clue it would be like this, perhaps I wouldn’t have come,” said Chetan.The train pulled into platform 1, but passengers were told that all the gates were closed on that side, and they would have to exit via platform 6. “We were shocked. It didn’t seem logical. We had to carry out luggage all the way to the other end of the station, only to realise that there was no transport to take us home,” Chetan said.
