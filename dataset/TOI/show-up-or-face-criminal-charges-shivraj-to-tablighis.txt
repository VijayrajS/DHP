Show up or face criminal charges: Shivraj to Tablighis
2020-04-09
BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday gave a 24-hour ultimatum to Tablighi Jamaat members to show up for testing or face criminal charges.

Chouhan appealed to people to follow the lockdown, saying: “Talk to the sofa, if you have to, but stay at home.”

With a large chunk of the new cases across the state being Tablighi members – 20 are in Bhopal itself – the CM took a tough stand on those hiding travel history or symptoms of the disease. “The administration has quarantined everyone who attended Nizamuddin Markaz and identified the people from abroad who have been hiding in mosques. Even after this, if someone is hiding somewhere, then I request him to inform the administration within the next 24 hours,” tweeted Chouhan.
