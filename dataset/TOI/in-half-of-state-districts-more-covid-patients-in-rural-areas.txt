Jaipur district has recorded more than 100 positive cases from its rural parts.

Out of 2,803 active cases in the state, 2,620 are migrants, health department figures show. As many as 11 lakh people have reached Rajasthan from Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai and many other Covid-19 hotspots. They have been quarantined at their homes and institutional facilities to contain spread of the virus in rural areas.
