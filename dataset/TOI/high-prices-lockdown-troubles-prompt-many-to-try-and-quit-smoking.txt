High prices, lockdown troubles prompt many to try and quit smoking
2020-04-23
NAGPUR: Every puff of a cigarette is now turning more money into smoke for regular smokers. With cigarette manufacturers as well as sellers shut across the country, the few grocery stores with stocks of cigarette are charging a hefty premium. Even domestic brands earlier priced at Rs160 for a pack of 10 are now being sold at Rs200-300, with prices of imported cigarettes almost doubling.


More and more people are also seeing the lockdown as an opportunity to give up the cigarette habit, which almost all of them have been trying to give up anyway.

Yogesh Thakur, a pan shop owner at Trimurti Nagar, has kept his shop closed since the lockdown. “This is a no-win situation for all. Even my manufacturers and distributors are out of work,” he said.

He admits, though, that those who have stock are selling one stick costing Rs12-13 for Rs20-25 rupees. Many grocery shop owners in the city have cigarette stocks, which they are selling at high rate, which smoking addicts are forced to pay. “From paying Rs13 for one, I am now spending double,” said Debashree Patil (name changed).

Pan shop owner Ajay Vishwakarma expressed disappointment over the sale of cigarettes at high rates by some people, but added, “We cannot stop them. But we cannot open our shops, as cops hound us for coming on the streets.”

On the other hand, people grounded at homes are finding it difficult to light up in front of their wives or family and children.

Priya Bapat (name changed), a student, has already started to see the brighter side of this situation and cut down her cigarette consumption. “I am not a chain smoker but used to have a puff once a day. Now, I have not smoked for three days straight, which is great progress, as I always wanted to quit,” said Bapat.

Another smoker Atul Nagrani (name changed), a salesman, said, “I do feel the urge to smoke, but staying with family and kids makes it difficult. I now only smoke one cigarette as against five earlier. The lockdown has made me realize I can quit if I want to,” he said.

Interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat believes this is the best time for chain smokers to quit for better health. “The lockdown and high prices are a good opportunity for people who took up smoking due to peer pressure or work life stress,” he said.

People with respiratory problems and active smoking habit have a higher risk of catching coronavirus or any other viral infection too, he said. “People should understand their lungs are being compromised. Also, falling ill will risk the life of their family and children too.”

Talking about the psychological perspective of quitting smoking, Dr Naznin Chimthanwala, a consulting psychologist and counsellor psychotherapist, said only abstaining will help get rid of the addiction. “To get rid of the habit, replace it with something else. Mouth fresheners and fennel seeds (without sugar) are the best option, as sugar too can be addictive,” she said.

More than giving up cigarette now, once the lockdown ends and cigarettes are easily available again, there is a higher risk of the habit coming back, she said. “One the pressure is gone, smokers will run behind cigarettes like anything. The only solution is self awareness, abstaining and replacing,” she said.
