2020-03-14
JAIPUR: Following the unfolding coronavirus crisis across the country, the Rajasthan government decided on Friday to close schools, colleges, coaching centres, gymnasium, movie theatres and theatre halls till March 30.


The decision taken by chief minister Ashok Gehlot follows a central government advisory. The move will not impact ongoing board examinations in schools and colleges.

During this period, music programmes and staging of plays will remain suspended in the state. The move came after Gehlot presided over a high-level review meeting on the status of the spread of coronavirus at the chief minister’s residence late in the evening on Friday.

“I advise people not to panic due to the threat of the virus. I also appeal to the people to restrict moving in the crowded areas and use public transport for commuting only if necessary,” Gehlot said. He said that the decision follows World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations declaring it a pandemic. “This was followed by an advisory from the central government. To prevent the spread of the disease we have taken this stringent move,” he said.

The decision is not applicable to medical and nursing colleges. He also urged people to keep marriages a low-key affair and invite only limited number of guests.

He also directed officials to create awareness among people by issuing advisories on a regular basis. Officials apprised Gehlot that so far 370 people have been given diagnostic tests for the virus in the state with three, including an Italian couple, testing positive. He was also informed that three lakh people have been screened for the virus in the state. Officials at the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) have been asked to identify buildings that can be used to quarantine coronavirus patients if the situation in the city becomes worse.
