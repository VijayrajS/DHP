Secunderabad: Ministers, MLAs, civic body corporators and Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) ward members are spreading awareness on combating the spread of coronavirus among residents of cantonment areas. 

On Saturday, ward member J Maheshwar Reddy visited residential areas in Bapuji Nagar, Soujanya Colony, Kamsali Bazar and the weekly vegetable market at Peddathokatta and distributed masks to the vendors. Another ward member S Keshava Reddy went on rounds in his ward in an autorickshaw making public announcements on the precautionary measures to be taken in order to fight the spread of the virus.

Playing a key role in the effort, a ward member, J Maheswar Reddy, even served food to police personnel with the help of residents, besides serving free meals to the homeless and orphans. 

Meanwhile, the SCB’s health and sanitation wing is making arrangements to mark blocks with bleaching powder in front of all grocery shops and milk booths to help customers follow social distancing. 

The sanitisation staff is also spraying disinfectants at bus stops in Gunrock Enclave, Sitaramnagar and various other cantonment areas, sanitising buildings, residential areas, school premises, libraries, parks and markets. “Action plans have been prepared as per the directions of Director General Defence Estates (DGDE). Measures have also been taken to ensure uninterrupted water supply as well as streetlights,” according to a senior SCB official.
