2020-04-13
THANE: Kopri will be cut off from the rest of Thane to prevent the entry of suspected/infected coronavirus cases into the area, Thane municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal announced on Sunday.

The decision was taken following a ward-wise analysis of positive cases by Singhal, who directed that wards in Thane be classified into red, orange and green zones, depending on the number of infected people reported here. Kopri, which has no Covid-19 cases so far, was the only area marked as green zone.

Mumbra and Kalwa, which were tagged red zones, will also be cordoned off to prevent any infected person from moving out and spreading contamination. Only police, civic staffers associated with essential services, and milk and grocery delivery will be allowed in the ward, said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner.

A final report of the ward classification will be ready by Monday morning, he added.
