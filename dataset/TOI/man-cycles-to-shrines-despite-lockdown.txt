2020-03-30
City-based Ram Chandran, who has been cycling to religious shrines across India and Nepal, is continuing his travels despite the lockdown in the country.

He was cycling on National Highway 44 in Ambala on Friday when volunteers helping migrant workers stopped and offered him food and gave him hand sanitizers and masks, mistaking him for a migrant returning home.

Ram Chandran, however, told the group of volunteers that he was on a quest to visit 250 temples in India and had taken leave for two-and-a-half months for his trip. “I started my journey from Jagannath Temple in Puri and from there I went to Kali Temple in Kolkata, then to Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu, Nepal. From there, I went to Haridwar and then to Jawalaji in Himachal Pradesh. Then I went to Vaishno Devi and Golden Temple,” said the man who has spent a month and 27 days cycling alone. 

“ I am travelling on the belief of Sri Ram and God and so far, in this journey, my bicycle has not got punctured even once. due to curfew, I have been stopped at many places,” Chandran said and added that he was cycling to Hyderabad now.
