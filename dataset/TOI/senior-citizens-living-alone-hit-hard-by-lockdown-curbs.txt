Madurai: The lockdown has left several senior citizens, who live alone and do not have vehicles, feeling helpless as many of them are unable to get essential supplies and finding it difficult to move out for their health care and banking needs.Elderly persons are often seen on roads requesting lift from bikers. P Shankaran, 65, a resident of Iravathanallur, said he often suffers health problems due to aging and finds it difficult to go to government Rajaji hospital, which is 6 km away. “I used to prefer share autorickshaws spending Rs 40 for a visit to the hospital. In the absence of public transport, I do not have any other option but to seek for hitch-hiking,” he said.He said that not many are coming forward to help him, when he seeks help on road. He said that he has to ask at least 10 people before someone stops to give him a lift.A Palani, an elderly person from Vandiyur, said that although he does not require mobility frequently, he has to travel when he wants to withdraw money from banks or ATMs. “My only son is working in Coimbatore and there is no one to help me and my wife. I don’t have a scooter. I have a bicycle, which I could not ride due to aging,” he said. Palani too takes hitch-hiking, whenever he wants to go to market or withdraw old age pension from banks.A biker from Sellur said that he used to give lift to school children or elderly people, but he is skeptical off late due to the pandemic. “There are two problems. Since Covid-19 can easily attack elderly, I am scared to provide lift to them. There is also a risk of getting caught by police for moving in the city with a pillion,” he said.
