Vijayawada: A day after the city police quarantined two cops who aided a Covid-19 patient, another 36 women police staff were put under quarantine as secondary contacts on Thursday.

According to cops, the entire staff of Disha police station including a DSP-rank officer has been kept under quarantine after the incident surfaced.

Police sources said since both the sub-inspector and a cyber expert were found to be primary contacts of the deceased Covid-19 patient, the entire staff of Disha police station have been kept in home quarantine for the time being. “We have also sent the samples of the sub-inspector and cyber expert for Covid-19 testing and are awaiting for its results,” a senior city police official told TOI.

The incident happened on April 20 when the 55-year-old woman who was suffering from dehydration and fever was first taken to Global Hospital by her family. Later, the hospital authorities advised them to take her to old GGH as they did not have outpatient services. Since there were no vehicles, a sub-inspector and a cyber expert working at the Disha police station took her along with her husband to the GGH in on their vehicle.

Eventually, the woman passed away while she was being taken to ESI hospital from New Vijayawada GGH. During the course of contact tracing, it was learnt that both the SI and the cyber expert happen to have transported them.
