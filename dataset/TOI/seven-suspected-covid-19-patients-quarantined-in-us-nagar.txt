RUDRAPUR: As many as seven suspected coronavirus patients were quarantined in Udham Singh Nagar district on Wednesday. All the seven patients are from the same family, district health officials said, adding that the residential premises where the family stays, were also disinfected by the department.


District’s chief medical officer Dr Shailja Bhatt told TOI that the suspects are related with a woman from Pilibhit (Uttar Pradesh) who has tested positive for Covid-19. 

"As reported to us, the family came in contact with a coronavirus positive woman a few days back. So as a precautionary measure, we have quarantined them,” she added. 

However, sources told TOI that the family members were denying that they came in contact with the infected woman.

Meanwhile, health department officials found out about a woman from Bageshwar who had returned from France recently and was staying at a hotel in Rudrapur.

The woman has now been quarantined in that hotel itself.
