In a video appeal to the people of the state, the CM spoke about the state’s preparedness to counter the virus and emphasised how its prevention was easy.

In the two-and-a-half-minute video, Yogi said: “The entire world is battling with coronavirus. The governments at the Centre and in the state are taking all possible efforts to provide best quality treatment to patients suffering from coronavirus. As many as 1,268 beds have been reserved across Uttar Pradesh to set up isolation wards in all the 75 districts.” The chief minister added that even as arrangements were being made, prevention was easier and more important. 

“Prevention will not only save the ones who adopt it, but also contribute towards saving one’s family, neighbourhood and community at large. Any suspected person, living anywhere, must get in touch with health officials in their district and follow isolation protocols. Washing hands with soap several times a day is the most effective step to keep the virus away,” he said. 

The video message is a joint effort of UP government, state health and panchayati raj departments, National health Mission, Unicef and WHO. 

The health team has produced 10 such videos with messages from health minister Jai Pratap Singh, technical experts, religious leaders among others.
