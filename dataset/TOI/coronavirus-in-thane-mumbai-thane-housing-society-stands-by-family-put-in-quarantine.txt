Coronavirus scare: Thane housing society stands by family put in quarantine
2020-03-18
THANE: While there are reports of a few housing societies in Mumbai not allowing foreign-returned residents to enter premises, a Thane building has gone out of the way to ensure that one of its residents and his family, who arrived from a Covid-19 notified country on Monday, don't feel isolated.

 Initially apprehensive, the building's other residents consulted health experts and have now ensured that the family is strictly quarantined. They have ensured doorstep delivery of items, including grocery, for a fortnight so that the family doesn't need to step out. 

"Our committee decided to stand by the family that has been put in home quarantine. It could have been any of us. So we decided to stand by them. We regularly interact with them on the intercom," said a committee member of the society.

 A few societies have started restricting the entry of outsiders, mandating "thorough sanitisation" for members. A complex has sought an undertaking from families about recent foreign travel while helps and workers have been asked to stay away. 

 Meanwhile, after Kasarwadavli locals objected to work on a quarantine facility there, mayor Naresh Mhaske on Tuesday appealed to them to cooperate with the administration. "Municipal staff are working tirelessly to ensure that the coronavirus does not spread. So, residents should cooperate with them. Quarantine facilities are being developed in some parts of Thane, but there is no reason to worry for locals as the administration is taking all possible precautions."
