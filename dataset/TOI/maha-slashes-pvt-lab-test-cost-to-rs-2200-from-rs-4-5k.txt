PUNE: The state government on Saturday slashed the cost of Covid-19 test in private laboratories to Rs2,200 from Rs4,500 with immediate effect.


After reducing the price of private Covid-19 tests by more than 50%, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the move would enable more people to go to private laboratories for tests. He claimed that the new private testing rates were the lowest in the country.

Tope told TOI that Rs2,200 would be charged for collecting swabs through viral transport media (VTM) from hospitals. For collection of swabs from home, Rs2,800 would be charged. He said legal action would be taken against any laboratories charging more than the prescribed rates.

Earlier, the rates were Rs4,500 and Rs5,200, respectively.The minister said the revised rates were the maximum the laboratories could charge from patients and district collectors could negotiate further to reduce the charges.
