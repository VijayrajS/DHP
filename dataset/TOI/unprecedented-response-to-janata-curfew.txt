Coronavirus outbreak:  Unprecedented response to ‘janta curfew’
2020-03-23
BHOPAL: Eerie silence prevailed on the roads in Bhopal city on Sunday as people responded overwhelmingly to Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s call for 14-hour ‘Janta curfew’ across the country from 7.00 am to 9.00 pm.

It was a virtual curfew-like situation with police and security personnel seen at some places and barely one or two vehicles seen in a distance of about a Km on roads. The extent of undeclared lockdown could be gauged by the fact that in some areas, even newspapers were not distributed in the morning. In several localities milk booths, petrol pumps and medical shops were also closed, though they had been exempted from ‘Janta curfew’.

Vinod Shrivastava, who runs a medical shop at Mandakini shopping complex in Kolar, said he had opened his shop but it was difficult sitting in the completely deserted complex and even customers were not coming to buy anything. “I closed the shop after an hour and went home. I didn’t see a single person on the road in that one hour”, he said.

In the entire stretch from Trilanga to M P Nagar Zone I at 4.00 pm, not a single shop was open including milk booths, medical shops and pan shops.

Alok Tiwari, who stays in an apartment on Hoshangabad Road said it was a strange feeling watching some boys playing cricket on road towards the evening, the same roads which usually remain clogged with traffic.

Shops stayed closed in markets of the old city as well, but movement of people and traffic was much more than in new Bhopal areas.

Sunday remains a holiday in any case, but knowing that everyone has to remain indoors, people had made plans on how to pass time without boredom.

Manas Mishra, a government employee told TOI that his day started with a family prayer. “After worshipping our ancestral idol, we recited Hanuman Chalisa for positive vibes, which was live streamed on our extended family WhatsApp group. In the afternoon, we settled down to make ourselves a typical Malwa meal of ‘daal baati’ which everyone relished. We took a nap and watched a film. In the evening, we all assembled on our front porch with our thalis to extend support to the brave souls, who are out there offering services for everyone’s protection.”

The self-imposed curfew also gave time to everyone to do something which they are not able to do otherwise due to lack of time. Rishi Manuja said, “Being a professional I don’t get to spend a lot of time with myself. Whenever possible, I spent a lot of time busting myths on WhatsApp because fake news is so dangerous. People don’t understand that there is a difference between holding on to positive thoughts and staying in denial. My family WhatsApp group was bustling with discussions around Corona and I actively participated because I think awareness starts with our families.”

If the response to call for “Janta Curfew” was unprecedented so was the call to express gratitude to people engaged in essential services braving the threat from Coronavirus. People clapping, banging thalis or ringing bells (ghantis) appeared on their terrace in several societies and colonies as a gesture of gratitude towards them. At some places, though, people while doing so assembled on the gate of a society or a playground in the midst of the houses, which wasn’t advisable.

People also felt that the “Janta Curfew” also turned out to be successful in terms of spreading awareness about Coronavirus and how it spreads as far they were not taking interest in the matter, thinking it’s not a big deal.

Angel Saxena, a photographer said, “Being a citizen of the nation, I understood the importance of the Janta curfew. It united us all in a sense. Now we know that it’s almost our duty not to go out and stay inside homes and this is the bare minimum that we all can do at this point of time. It’s a collective fight. The non-suspected citizens have a greater role to play so let’s not panic and hope for the best.”
