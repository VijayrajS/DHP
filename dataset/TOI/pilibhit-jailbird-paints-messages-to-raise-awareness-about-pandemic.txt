Pilibhit: A prisoner in Pilibhit district jail is using his painting skills to spread awareness among prisoners about essential safety measures they need to adopt to prevent getting infected by novel coronavirus. So far, Anupam Trivedi has made two paintings on walls of the jail campus that portray how people may checkmate Covid-19 by resorting to minor but lifestyle changes.As per jail authorities, Anupam plans to make some more paintings to depict the importance of social distancing and the moral duty of the masses to honour frontline fighters against the infection, as a token of gratitude to them for their struggle to protect the people from the pandemic.His forthcoming paintings will also spread the message that attacks on lives of the protectors — medical staff and police — is a devilry which cannot be exonerated by God or law, said Anoop Singh, the superintendent of district jail.A commerce graduate, Anupam (41) had been sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years by the district and session’s court on November 10, 2016, after he was lodged in Pilibhit jail on May 18, 2015 on the charge of killing his wife, Sandhya, for dowry.His artistic skill was first recognised by jail authorities when he sketched a picture of Lord Shiva on a jail wall with a pencil. “Following this, we started showing him YouTube videos on painting techniques to embellish his innate skills. These efforts have transformed Anupam into a refined painter,” Anoop Singh said.“The paint, brush and other material is being arranged by jail officials. Deputy jailer Vikram Singh Yadav is the key motivator behind raising the morale of this creative prisoner,” he added.A few days ago, Anupam had also composed a poem to inspire prisoners to collectively fight the virus pandemic, which was appreciated by everyone in jail, Singh further said.
