2020-05-25
JAIPUR: The change in temperature has had no impact on Covid-19 spread, and the state has witnessed a significant spike in new cases as well as deaths in the month of May. As many as 4,444 cases have been reported in May so far from a total of 7,028. This accounts for 63% of the total cases reported till date. Also, 105 deaths have been reported for the month out of a total of 163 deaths, so far, for the state, accounting for 64% of all deaths.

 


The behaviour of Covid-19 in intense heat, which was expected to be prone to it, has come as a surprise for health authorities. Since May 1, new cases have constantly increased along with deaths in comparison to March and April, collectively. The graph of active cases, which had started to flatten from April 25 to May 10, began to move upwards, and currently shows 3,017 active cases. The highest single-day spike was also reported in May when 338 persons were found infected on May 19, indicating that rising temperature has no impact on the virus.

“The first Covid-19 case was reported on March 3. Even with summer intensifying, we are reporting more cases,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, CMHO, Jaipur-I, who is leading the fight in the city’s hotspot areas.
