As part of the drive, the SDMC commissioner and area representatives visited the area’s busy commercial hub on Saturday. Standing committee member and former mayor Narendra Chawla said focussed steps were being taken in the belt to fight the virus. “We inspected the district centre, the busiest commercial hub in the region, and appealed to traders to keep hand sanitisers for everyone,” Chawla said. 

The environment management services department has been asked to make soaps available at multiple high footfall points along with water. “Soaps have already been provided at all public utilities and common surfaces are being disinfected with a solution of sodium hypochlorite,” he said.

The deputy commissioner of the west zone said public announcements were being made with the help of 29 mega mikes and hired autos to spread awareness about Covid-19. 

The public health official who is leading the drive said four cases had been confirmed in the region with one death. Capacity-building exercises, he added, have been carried out so that any suspected case can be isolated immediately. 

“The surveillance system has been made more robust. All 33 hotels in the zone are reporting daily about any new arrival and the compiled data is being sent to the district surveillance officer,” the officer said. “One suspected case at a hotel and was sent to RML Hospital.”

Grassroots-level staff, departmental heads and councillors, who have been trained about safety steps, are also disseminating the information, the officer said. “We have also briefed them that not everyone needs a mask,” he added. 

To spread awareness, all restaurants and hotels have been given banners and handbills to help them understand the symptoms and hygiene steps such as hand washing, another health official said. These establishments have been told not to allow any staffer with cough-sneezing symptoms at work.
