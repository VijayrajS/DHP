Migrants quarantined in ‘palm leaf shelter’
2020-05-20
PATNA: At least seven migrant workers, who have returned from Chhattisgarh, are having to stay outside their village in ‘temporary homes’ made of palm leaves as they couldn’t be accommodated at the nearest quarantine centre under Madanpur block in Maoist-hit Aurangabad district.

Kapil Singh, 25, Raj Kumar Bhokta, 45, Vinod Singh Bhokta, 32, Arvind Kumar, 21, Santosh Kumar, 22, Sandip Kumar, 20, and Mithilesh Kumar, 24, all residents of Pipargari village under Dakshin Umanga panchayat, returned on Saturday.

Kapil, who worked as a daily wager in a rice mill in Chhattisgarh, said, “We were advised to stay in home quarantine and maintain social distancing. So we returned to our native village but were stopped by some local residents. The families also agreed with them and denied our entry in homes.”

Sandip Kumar, however, claimed that though none of the group of seven have shown symptoms of Covid19, they have not undergone any test. “At present we don’t have health issues. But in case we are tested positive for the deadly virus at a later date, then at least none of the villagers will be infected because of us,” he said.

Several of them admitted that they live in one-room houses with their families and there is no way they can keep themselves in isolation. “In fact, home is too crowded for safe quarantine,” said another migrant worker Mithilesh Kumar.

When contacted, BDO of Madanpur Kanishka Kumar Singh said, “We have not received any such information either from the local authority or from any representative of the area. Since the area in considered a hotbed of Maoists, we will first inform the district control room and then action will be taken accordingly.”

He, however, claimed that three out of five quarantine centres were operational under Madanpur block. Over 400 migrant workers reached the block headquarters from different states on Tuesday and they were subsequently quarantined.
