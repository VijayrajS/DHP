PATNA: The pantry car and brake van of the New Delhi-Agartala AC special train (02502) were fully sanitised at the Danapur railway station on Thursday after one of the pantry car staff showed Covid-19 symptoms.

According to sources, the pantry car employee complained of fever and acute body ache after boarding the special train in New Delhi on Wednesday. At Kanpur, he was medically examined by railway doctors and taken to a hospital for Covid-19 test. Other staff then wanted a thorough sanitization of the pantry car and their medical check-up as well.

Danapur control room then received a message from the train superintendent and station officials of Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction about immediate need of sanitization of the pantry car of the special train. Thus, the special train which had stoppage at Patliputra Junction only, made an unscheduled stoppage at the Danapur station where its pantry car and brake van were fully sanitised.

Danapur chief medical superintendent (CMS) R K Verma said the pantry car was full sanitised and all staff were screened after the train reached the railway station. 

Meanwhile, ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar has contradicted a news report published in a vernacular daily regarding deaths of passengers on board the Shramik Special trains due to the negligence of the railways. He said in some cases, only critically ill passengers died on board trains.
