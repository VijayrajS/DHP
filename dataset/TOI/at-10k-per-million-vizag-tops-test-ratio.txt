2020-06-14
VISAKHAPATNAM: Since testing began in Visakhapatnam’s labs in early April, the district has conducted the most number of Covid-19 tests (42,000 samples) per million population in the state. Testing stands at around 10,000 tests per million population (the district has a population of 4.2 million or 42 lakh), higher than the state average of 9,500 tests per million (AP’s population is nearly 90 million in 2020). 


Speaking to TOI, special officer for Covid-19 (Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts) Dr PV Sudhakar said, “Whenever we come across a positive case, we are testing anybody directly or indirectly associated with the patient, even if the primary and secondary contacts have no symptoms. In fact, over 80% of those testing positive are asymptomatic. We are now focusing on everyone in containment zones and are not scared about the increasing number of positives daily because it is a result of enhanced testing.” As per officials, of the total 252 cases so far (till June 12), apart from the 164 local residents, there are 81 returnees to Vizag from various states, districts and countries who have also tested positive.

As per district health officials, 1,000-1,500 samples are tested on a daily basis, up from 400-500 samples in April. Prior to April 11, samples were sent and tests conducted at Kakinada. “At present, tests are being conducted by five RT-PCR machines located at the test lab and Naco lab at King George Hospital. Truenat tests are being held in DST lab of Government Hospital for Chest and Infectious Diseases. However, in Vizag, private labs may not be roped in as they do not have NABL accreditation specifically for Covid-19 test and applying for and getting accreditation is a time-consuming process,” said a health official.
