2020-05-01
Panaji: Goa-based ICAR-CCARI will study the impact of coronavirus on farming with respect to the problems faced, losses incurred, marketing, etc.

The directorate of arecanut and spices development, Kerala has written to the heads of ICAR institutes to assess the impact and loss in spice sector due to Covid-19 and the measures to overcome its adverse effects. 

This would, however, require ICAR-CCARI to conduct a door-to-door survey.

“All of this is possible only after the lockdown is lifted. For now, there will be no gatherings, no Krishi melas and no conferences,” director of ICAR-CCARI, E B Chakurkar said.

He said that carrying out the assessment will first require a census of the total number of farmers carrying out spice cultivation, the area under cultivation and the losses incurred. With lockdown restrictions and social distancing norms in play, a detailed survey is difficult.
