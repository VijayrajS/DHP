2020-02-09
BHARUCH/SURAT: With Coronavirus spreading its tentacles across the world, the deadly virus has become a universal fear. So much so that even the authorities of a remote school in Ankleshwar has issued a circular to the parents to send their children wearing mask to school which will safeguard them from any such infectious airborne diseases. 

Minaxi Bhardwaj, principal of Swami Vivekanand English Medium School said there is no harm in taking precaution. Talking to TOI, she said: “We haven’t made it mandatory, but have advised parents to take precautionary measures to ensure their children are safe wearing masks.”

 The other crucial purpose for the mask order is to educate students about the deadly virus and also how they can protect themselves from hazards. Children are the future of our country and making them aware of happenings around them will make them ‘informed glocal citizens’, she explained.

Bhardwaj added that it is heartening to see most of the students wearing masks, which is a healthy sign. 

Nimaben Solanki, a parent said that she was happy that the school has taken a novel step to educate children about the seriousness of health issues and importance of hygiene. “Precautionary measures should be taken,” she added.

Shorya Modi, a student said that the teachers have taught them how to keep ourselves clean, wash hands several times in a day and cover the mouth with a hanky while coughing or sneezing.
