KOLKATA: M R Bangur Hospital has received 15 ventilators to handle Covid-19 cases. Ten medical officers in the hospital are being trained to operate the equipment. The facility in Tollygunge is the district hospital for South 24-Parganas. It was recently designated as one of the four ‘state-level’ city hospitals for treatment of Covid-19. The state health department plans to equip M R Bangur with 1,100 beds for Covid-19 patients. A floor of the burns unit is being developed to handle critical patients.


Sishir Naskar, superintendent of M R Bangur Hospital said that patients with Covid-19 may require a ventilator because they can develop severe respiratory distress, most commonly out of pneumonia.

“One must be very careful while handling a ventilator or it may become counter-productive,” Ajoy Sarkar, clinical director, intensive care unit (ICU), Peerless Hospital, said, adding, “Of course, the new machines would boost the M R Bangur Hospital’s infrastructure. But it’s also important to know how to man them. If Bangur or any other government hospitals need guidance on using the ventilators or advice on Covid-19 cases, the private health sector is ready to help.”

He agreed that at the centre of the Covid-19 crisis is the demand for ventilators. “Patients would need the support from these machines which are attached to them either via a tube inserted through the mouth, or to a mask that goes around the nose and mouth. The machine forces air into patients, providing oxygen. This allows the patient to relax and exhale,” said Arindam Biswas, consultant (general medicine), R N Tagore Hospital.
