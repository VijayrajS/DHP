Reconsider pricing of N95 masks: Bombay HC to Centre
2020-06-10
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to reconsider its N95 masks pricing ensure that it conforms with the drug pricing law. The Centre, represented by additional solicitor general Anil Singh, said it would do so in ten days.

The development took place at a video-conference hearing before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice S S Shinde. The HC was hearing a PIL filed by Sucheta Dalal and former AAP member, Anjali Damania, who through their counsel Mihir Desai wanted the price of these essential masks to be capped by the Centre, at a time when their supply was falling short too.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA)—set up under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers— had in its affidavit pointed to a May 15 meeting attended by the ministries where stakeholders were against any price capping but said they would do so in future, if required. The NPPA, however, said on its request the manufacturers had dropped the price by up to 47 %.

Desai said masks were initially selling for Rs 40 and if the prices could fall to Rs 95, they ought to be reconsidered. N95 masks are notified as “drugs’’ and comes under Drugs (prices control) Order of 2013 which means the maximum retail price cannot increase by more than 10% of what it was in the preceding 12 months. This point is what the bench focused on.

The Centre said that at a meeting held last month meeting it was felt that capping may prove to be a disincentive to domestic manufacturers.
