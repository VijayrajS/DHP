PUNE: The civic body will form 15 response teams at the ward-office level to control the spread of Covid-19 that has so far claimed 43 lives. 

These teams will coordinate numerous tasks pertaining to suspected as well as positive patients. They will also be responsible for resources management regarding Covid-19 mitigation programme. 

Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said they would use these teams to coordinate the activities with the PMC’s head office. “These teams will help in transporting the patients and also in other work related Covid-19 containment plan,” PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal said.

The teams will comprise officials from the health, establishment, solid waste management and electrical departments. The teams will also coordinate with ambulances for the transportation of patients.

The officials said the PMC was facing delays in getting the data from the Sassoon hospital. To tide over this inconvenience, the teams will help the civic administration collect the data.
