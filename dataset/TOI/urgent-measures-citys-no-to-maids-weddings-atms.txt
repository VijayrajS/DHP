2020-03-14
LUCKNOW: City residents are making urgent changes in lifestyle to combat the colossal public health challenge posed by the novel coronavirus, as the global toll crosses the 5,000 mark.

From sending domestic helps to indefinite leave and working from home to avoiding weddings and even ATMs — citizens are pulling out all the stops to curb a pandemic that already has 1.4 lakh confirmed patients worldwide. Kamal Bhasin, a businesswoman in LDA Colony, said her whole neighbourhood had asked maids to stay home. “Juggling household chores with office work is a challenge, but obviously not as big,” she said.

Charbagh resident Mukesh Mishra and his wife were supposed to attend a family wedding in Chandigarh in March-end. “But, we decided to cancel the trip. Many of our relatives who live abroad will be there at the function. We cannot risk an infection at our age,” said the man who is pushing 70. If eating out on weekends is no longer an option for homemaker Rimjhim Sharma and her family, Nalini Singh of Gomtinagar is ignoring food delivery options. People are even not using ATMs. “Digital wallets are safer. Who knows if an infected person has used machine,” said student Rahul Pathak.
