2020-04-15
HYDERABAD: The state is mulling to ease lockdown restrictions in a phased manner post April 20, starting with relaxing norms in districts logging zero Covid-19 positive cases. 


However, districts and locations, including Greater Hyderabad, reporting high number of cases may have to endure complete lockdown till May 3. The Union government on Tuesday extended lockdown till May 3 and announced that it would allow some activities, relaxing lockdown norms, after April 20. Later in the day, it issued guidelines to states. The Centre would allow movement of trucks, MSMEs and some categories of industries to function with minimum manpower, engaged in production of wheat flour, edible oil and pulses, provided they stick to social distancing norms and other health guidelines after April 20. 

"The state government has also categorised areas and activities, where relaxations can be granted, after reviewing the situation. The relaxations will be in a phased manner," health minister Eatala Rajender told TOI on Tuesday. "The government will allow certain activities like construction and small-scale industries to function if locations or towns have zero cases and far away from the affected areas," a senior health department official said.
