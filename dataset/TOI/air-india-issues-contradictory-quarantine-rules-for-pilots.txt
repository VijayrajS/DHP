Air India issues contradictory quarantine rules for pilots
2020-04-11
MUMBAI: Air India’s medical department and its operations department have contradicted each other over rules for quarantining pilots after international flights. The medical department issued an standard operating procedure (SOP) on Thursday stating that pilots who return from international operations should be put under 14-day home quarantine. But the operations department, citing a circular by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), ruled that there is no need to quarantine the pilots, unless there’s a Covid-19 positive case on board the flight they operated. 

In Air India, as is the case with other airlines, the operations department carries more weight than the medical department. An Air India spokesperson said, “Going by the aforementioned circular, we may be requisitioning the services of some crew members who have not tested positive nor shown any symptom. That’s why the letters may have been issued.” The spokesperson added that the airline was adhering to the DGCA circular. 

However, there is a contradictory SOP in circulation as well. “Cockpit crew/cabin crew shall be quarantined at home for 14 days, post exposure/international travel,” said the second point in an SOP issued on Thursday by Dr V D Turbadkar, AI deputy general manager-medical services.

Currently, Air India pilots are rostered either to operate flights to take stranded foreigners back to their countries or to operate cargo flights. An Air India pilot couple was recently quarantined at Seven Hills after the wife, who had operated a flight from NewYork in March, developed cough and fever about two weeks later. The duo had a harrowing time as they couldn’t get tested at home through a private testing centre as Air India couldn’t provide them with a referral on a doctor’s letterhead.
