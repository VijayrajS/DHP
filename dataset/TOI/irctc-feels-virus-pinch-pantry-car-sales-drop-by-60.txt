IRCTC feels virus pinch, pantry car sales drop by 60%
2020-03-19
Visakhapatnam: Following the outbreak of coronavirus, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) officials are in a Catch 22 situation. The sale of meals on trains handled by IRCTC Visakhapatnam area officials is down by 60 per cent in the past 14 days.

Officials said, initially there was a drop in demand for non-vegetarian meals including chicken and eggs. Officials tried hard to provide substitute vegetarian meals such as idli, dosa and veg cutlet for breakfast and paneer or any veg curry for lunch and dinner. However, they could not improve the situation as gradually the number of passengers onboard started dropping. “First the passengers were reluctant to take chicken and eggs. Now passenger occupancy onboard has decreased considerably. With this, the sale of food, especially on pantry cars, has dropped by more than 60 per cent,” Chandra Mohan Bisa, the area official (Visakhapatnam) of IRCTC told TOI.

Sale on long distance trains has also been affected considerably. One of the nine trains originates from Sambalpur and ends at Nanded in Maharashtra. 

An official confirmed that on Hirakund Express (Visakhapatnam – Amritsar) that departed on May 15 they could sell meals worth Rs 22,359. Whereas the average sale figure on that train is around Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000. “Despite giving our best effort to maintain cleanliness and hygiene on board, sale is not picking up. Rather, I would say it is deteriorating almost every day. People are actually apprehensive to buy outside food and our problem is worsening as passenger occupancy onboard is decreasing,” said an onboard supervisor of IRCTC. Although IRCTC hires an outsourced agency to run the pantry car, it also appoints a BSc Hotel Management graduate on board to supervise the production onboard every train.
