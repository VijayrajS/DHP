KANYAKUMARI: Business has fallen flat at Kanyakumari district that has a range of tourist attractions including Kanyakumari city, beaches, forts and Thirparappu falls. The annual tourist footfall in Kanyakumari is more than 2 crore. “Summer tourism from the first week of April to the first week of June is the second big season attracting not less than 10 lakh tourists a month,” said a tourism official.

Number of tourists opting for boating to the Vivekananda Rock or Thiruvalluvar statue during the off season is 1,500 to 2,000. “During summer it touches 10,000 to 12,000, the latter being the full capacity for the service,” the official said and added that there have been occasions when they were unable to ferry tourists due to the crowd.

Industry sources said that Kanyakumari alone is the main sources of livelihood for nearly 8,000 people. This includes the more than 700 street vendors selling fruits and plastic items, more than 800 shops, nearly 50 hotels and small eateries and 80 lodges.

“Tourism industry is the source of livelihood for the nearly 70% of the voters in Kanyakumari town panchayat, the rest are fisherfolk,” says C S Subash, 38, who runs a fancy and toys store at Kanyakumari. He said that they have business for only four months a year – two months during the Sabarimala season and two months in the summer – with which they have to manage the show the entire year.

Stating that he used to make a profit of Rs 3,000 a day during the summer, he said he is paying half wage for his seven employees at Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 a week now even when business is down to zero. Among those affected are hundreds of tourist taxi and van drivers and operators and tourist guides.

“So far only 12 lakh tourists have visited Kanyakumari this year. A prime share of the footfall was till January 19 when the peak Sabarimala season and Pongal holidays,” the officer said.
