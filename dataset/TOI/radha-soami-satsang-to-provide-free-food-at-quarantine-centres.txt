2020-05-19
Nagpur: Radha Soami Satsang Beas, which has provided its sprawling premises on Kalmeshwar Road to develop 5,000-bedded quarantine centre, has now offered to provide free of cost food to people staying in nine quarantine centres across the city.

Assistant municipal commissioner Milind Meshram said the Satsang trust had submitted a proposal to provide the meals. 

The offer will help the cash-starved Nagpur Municipal Corporation which is spending almost Rs2 lakh per day for providing breakfast, lunch and dinner to over 1,700 people in different quarantine centres. Currently, the NMC is paying Rs159 for per person for providing meals at the centres.

“Food will be cooked at Satsang’s mega kitchen on its premises, while NMC will have to pay only for transportation expenses to deliver the cooked food to different quarantine centres,” said Meshram and added that the Satsang will probably start the service from May 21. 

The official further said that NMC will spend only Rs50 per person — Rs2 lakh to Rs2.50 lakh per day. 

Apart from this, the NMC is also providing ration kits to poor citizens, slum dwellers and food packets in shelter homes across the city. “We are also providing food packets to migrants travelling in special shramik trains, either leaving from city or passing through Nagpur railway station,” said Meshram.
