HYDERABAD: Nearly a week after a 55-year-old grocer from Chegur in Rangareddy district succumbing to Covid-19, a migrant worker from Bihar, also her tenant, has tested positive for coronavirus. Now, health authorities have clarity on the infection trail in the woman’s case.


After the death of the grocery store owner on April 1, police cordoned off the village and authorities placed 34 people, including immediate family members and four migrants staying as tenants at her house, in quarantine.

As the four workers from Bihar went to Uttarakhand on March 8 and returned to the city on March 19 by Sampark Kranti train from Nizamuddin, the authorities had suspected that some of them might have been infected during the journey. Police sent them to quarantine on Friday and their samples were collected on Saturday for testing. “Of the four workers, one has tested positive for Covid-19, two others tested negative, while test result of the fourth person is yet to come,” a Rangareddy district official said. 

State government officials have collected details of all the passengers who travelled to Telangana from Nizamuddin by train and flights between March 16 and March 22. “Passengers who travelled by Sampark Kranti, Rajdhani and Telangana Express have been identified,” a police official said. 

Not taking any chances, police were matching cell numbers gathered from cell phone tower dump of Nizamuddin Markaz area with details of train passenger cell phone numbers and trying to isolate them. “Put together, the train passengers and flight passengers are over 10,000. District-wise details have been disseminated for verification,” a police source said.
