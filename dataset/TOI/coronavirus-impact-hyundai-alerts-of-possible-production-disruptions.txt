2020-02-06
Chennai: As the consequential impact of lockdown of three China factories by Korean parent due to the Corona virus outbreak, Hyundai Motor India Ltd., has alerted its dealers of possible impact on vehicle deliveries.Hyundai Motor Corporation, Korea late on Tuesday night announced that it was suspending operations at three plants in China due to parts shortage. The suspension of production could be nearly a week, international news wires reported. The Korean chaebol’s Indian arm Hyundai Motor India sources a very small portion of parts for its production facilities in Sriperumbudur near Chennai from Korea, which in turn sources them from China.Sales teams officials have sent out messages to dealers asking them to place orders for vehicles earlier so that there are no shortages. “HMI factory is monitoring and checking the possibility of parts supply from China. However not sure,” the communication accessed by TOI said. “Do not feel that we are pushing for orders,” the communication read.A Hyundai India spokesperson denied any such communications were sent and that there were no issues in relation to production. “I can assure you that there is no impact on our production schedule as of now,” the spokesperson said.While most of Hyundai’s operations in India are localised from components standpoint, some parts do come from Korea and other global sources. “Sadly, you cannot roll out the car without that small part which is still imported. We do not have issues for now, but if the lockdown in China continues, not just us, but the entire auto market will feel the heat,” an official at the factory said, citing anonymity. “Don’t forget, China is the global manufacturing hub for parts and components and shifting supplier is not an easy task.”
