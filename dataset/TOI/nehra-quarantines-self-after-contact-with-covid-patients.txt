Ahmedabad: Vijay Nehra quarantines self after contact with Covid-19 patients
2020-05-06
AHMEDABAD: Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra announced on Tuesday that he was quarantining himself for 14 days as he had come in contact with people who had tested positive for Covid-19. The announcement sent many tongues wagging in the bureaucratic circles within the AMC and the state, with Covid cases rising in the city. 




Nehra’s announcement came soon after the 6:15pm video conference (VC) in which revenue minister Kaushik Patel and chief principal secretary to the CM, K Kailashnathan, introduced AMC’s deputy municipal commissioners and other municipal staff to additional chief secretary Rajiv Gupta, who will now lead the war on Covid in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. Nehra immediately signed out of the meeting. Gupta then formally introduced vice-chairman and CEO, Gujarat Maritime Board, Mukesh Kumar, as the new in-charge municipal commissioner. Senior officials in the municipal corporation said that there existed a political friction between Nehra and the standing committee, the mayor, and senior BJP MLAs who allegedly had issues with Nehra’s functioning. 

“Ahmedabad’s rising Covid numbers were a concern. This was also because of the aggressive testing,” said an AMC official. “But somehow the political wing felt that the situation was worsening, especially with the high death rates.”

Some senior politicians complained that Nehra would not listen to them, the AMC official said. Another official added, “Some senior politicians worried that Covid-19 may snowball into a big political issue ahead of municipal elections.”
