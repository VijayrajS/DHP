Maharashtra lifts many curbs, but extends lockdown
2020-06-01
MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has announced a calibrated easing of restrictions in red zones like Mumbai starting June 3 even as it extended the lockdown till the month-end. The step-by-step ‘unlocking’ has been dubbed the ‘Mission Begin Again’ programme for resumption of day-to-day activities in the worst-affected urban zones.


From outdoor pursuits such as jogging and cycling to opening up shops and accessibility to services offered by electricians, plumbers and cab drivers, the latest curtailing of curbs reflects a growing confidence in the state’s ability to control its Covid-19 numbers.

 

“We are doing away with the term ‘Lockdown’ and restarting again and while we do that, I hope we set an example for others with our self-discipline so that we are not forced to revoke any of these relaxations,” said CM Uddhav Thackeray. However, a night curfew will remain in force from 9pm to 5am till June 30.

The concessions will apply to 19 municipal corporations classified as red zones, except for containment zones in these jurisdictions. In the first phase, walking, cycling and jogging in open spaces will be permitted between 5 am and 7pm starting June 3. Self-employed workmen like plumbers, electricians and garage mechanics will also be allowed to resume work from this day, with prior appointments.

In the second phase starting June 5, shops and markets except those in malls and shopping complexes will function on alternate days; shops on one side of the road will open on one day and those on the other side the next. In the third phase starting June 8, private offices can resume with 10% staffing.
