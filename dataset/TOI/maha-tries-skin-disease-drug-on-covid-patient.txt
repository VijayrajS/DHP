MUMBAI: A 35-year-old Covid positive patient admitted at BMC-run KEM Hospital, Parel, became the first in Maharashtra to receive a novel biologics (drugs which contain components of a living organism) as part of a clinical trial to beat the viral infection.


The drug, Itolizumab, manufactured by Bengaluru-based biotech major Biocon to treat a skin condition called psoriasis, was given as an infusion to the patient over an eight-hour period on Saturday, said KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh.

Itolizumab is one of the drugs that Biocon has ‘repurposed’ to fight Covid-19-related complications. “Some weeks back, we applied to conduct a multi-centric clinical trial for Itolizumab at KEM Hospital and other civic hospitals that treat Covid-19,” said Deshmukh. TOI has not been able to verify if the drug has been administered for Covid-related treatment in any other state.

The drug has been classified as a “humanised anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody” or a laboratory-produced molecule meant to serve as substitute antibodies that can restore or modulate the immune system’s attack on foreign cells.

The patient is a driver from Worli who was admitted to KEM Hospital on April 27 and tested positive a day later. He is on oxygen support as his oxygen levels dipped to 90. “He can be classified as a moderately ill Covid patient and we hope the drug will boost his immune system enough for him to be able to fight the infection successfully,” said a KEM Hospital doctor. Meanwhile, BMC officials said the search is on for a second Covid patient who could be eligible for BMC’s ongoing plasma convalescent therapy clinical trial.
