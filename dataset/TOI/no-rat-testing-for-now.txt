Gujarat: No RAT testing for now
2020-04-22
AHMEDABAD/SURAT: After West Bengal and Rajasthan reported faulty Covid-19 results of Chinese Rapid Anti-Body Testing (RAT) kits, and ICMRâ€™s directive to put on hold use of these kits for next two days, Gujarat too has decided to defer its use for now.

The state was provided more than 24,000 kits on April 17, of which a major chunk was diverted to three major cities, Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation used 268 kits on first day to get eight positive cases. In Danilimda and Behrampura areas in Ahmedabad, which is at the centre of the Covid-19 outbreak in the city, some 15 kits were used to identify two Covid-19 positive cases. 

Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has also postponed the rapid testing for the next few days due to contradictory results of the testing kits.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health and family welfare department, pointed out the discrepancy in the test strips of these kits. "There are two confirmatory strips IgM and IgG in these kits and only when both these strips turn positive that we confirm a case. But in certain cases, only one of the two strips shows results while the other strip fails and hence the case remains inconclusive." Another senior health official added, "Another issue with the RAT kit is that, though it provides a confirmation with regard to Covid-19 case, but a negative test result does not rule out if the patient is infected with Covid-19 virus." 

Ravi said, "We were in the process of calibration of these RAT kits in various districts. So far, we are not in a position to give any opinion on their efficacy. Once we test a reasonable number of patients we will come to know."
