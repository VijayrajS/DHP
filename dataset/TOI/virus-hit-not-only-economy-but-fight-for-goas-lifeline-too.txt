Virus hit not only economy but fight for Goa’s lifeline too
2020-05-09
Keri: The outbreak of Covid-19 not only affected our economy, but also slowed down the ongoing process of planning Goa’s strategies against Maharashtra and Karnataka petitions. 

On August 14, 2018, the Mhadei water disputes tribunal gave the final award on the allocation of water of the Mhadei and it’s tributaries to Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka. However, three states have filed petitions for the enhancement of the water share as well as their grievances.

In the special leave petition, Goa has prayed to pass an injunction order against Karnataka from proceeding with further construction at the Kalsa nullah near Kankumbi. It also seeks an injunction against the neighbouring state from diverting water from the Mhadei basin to Malprabha basin. This petition has been listed for hearing on July 15, 2020, by the Supreme Court. 

However, presently the Goa government has not conducted any meetings to discuss and plan strategies for restraining Maharashtra and Karnataka from their ongoing projects. The contempt petition filed by Goa is in the Supreme Court’s list of matters for May 12.

Advocate general Devidas Pangam told TOI, “We will conduct meetings to plan our strategies as early as possible. Presently, on account of the outbreak of Covid-19, we have not visited Delhi to discuss the matter with our counsels.”

Chief engineer Shrikant Patil said, “We will conduct the meeting and make our best efforts to protect the interest of our state. We have appointed a team of well-versed counsels.”
