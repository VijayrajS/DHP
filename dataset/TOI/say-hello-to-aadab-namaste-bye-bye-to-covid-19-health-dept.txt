Say hello to aadab & namaste, bye-bye to Covid-19: Health dept
2020-03-05
BHOPAL: Indian greetings like ‘Aadab’ or ‘Namaste’ can help you tackle novel coronavirus (COVID-19), says the Madhya Pradesh health department.


With physical contact being one of the leading reasons for the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the state health department has urged people to adopt customary Indian greetings — ‘Namaste’ or ‘Aadab’ — as a precautionary measure. The campaign to avoid handshake is supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Since ‘Namaste’ or ‘Aadab’ do not involve touching the other person it is a hygienic way of greeting people and cuts the risk of transfer of germs.

So far, MP has not reported any COVID-19 positive case. Out of about 25,000 people under ‘community surveillance’ across India, MP ranks 11 with 363 people under observation. It is a figure higher than Rajasthan, which has reported COVID positive cases on Thursday. To deal with the possible outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in MP, the state has 349 beds and 104 ventilators across districts. As many as 60 hospitals in state are ready to tackle critical coronavirus cases, says the Union government data.

Going by status of logistics, isolation beds and hospitals in event of COVID-19 outbreak in MP, the situation is not inspiring, admitted a senior health department consultant. On Wednesday, a letter on MP health department website, pulled up CMHOs from Balaghat, Khargone, Badwani, Singralui, Indore and few other districts for not adhering to COVID-19 guidelines on reporting and monitoring of suspected cases.

A European Union fact sheet from evidence from analyses of cases to date is that COVID-19 infection causes mild disease (pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in about 80% of cases and most cases recover, 14 % have more severe disease and 6% experience critical illness.
