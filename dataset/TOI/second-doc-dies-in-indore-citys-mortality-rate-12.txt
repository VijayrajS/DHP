“A 65-year-old private practitioner died because of Covid-19. We are gathering information on him,” said Indore chief medical and health officer Dr Praveen Jadia.

The administration is trying to trace people who may have visited his clinic or come in contact with him. The doctor who died on Thursday had seen patients after testing negative twice for coronavirus.
