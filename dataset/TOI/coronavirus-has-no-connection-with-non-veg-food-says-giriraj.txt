PATNA: In an attempt to debunk myths associated with coronavirus, Union minister for animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries Giriraj Singh on Friday said non-veg food does not cause the disease. “I am surprised to notice that some district magistrates have ordered ban on non-veg food items,” the minister told reporters in Delhi.

Giriraj said he would soon release videos of him eating egg and meat in a bid to send out a message that non-veg food is safe as far as coronavirus is concerned.

Giriraj also shared a press statement issued by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) on his twitter handle on Thursday. According to the statement, coronavirus is not spread through non-veg food items.

“There is no need to create panic. The district magistrates should refrain from banning non-veg food items as it will affect the livestock sector and cause revenue losses to the country,” Giriraj said.

The minister added, “Tests found no trace of food contamination as far as coronavirus is concerned. If any official takes action without substantial finding, the entire country will suffer losses.”

Meanwhile, the press communique of FSSAI states that even food imported from the coronavirus-affected countries is safe for human consumption. FSSAI had constituted a committee of experts to examine the possibilities of presence of coronavirus in imported food items.

“The committee opined that as of now there is no conclusive evidence for the food-borne transmission of coronavirus. It agreed with the advisories of global organisations that the predominant routes of transmission of coronavirus appear to be human to human. It is also clarified that meat is safe to eat,” the press communique stated.

It, however, added that as a precautionary measure, the committee advised people to avoid consumption of raw or undercooked meat as well as unprocessed food products.
