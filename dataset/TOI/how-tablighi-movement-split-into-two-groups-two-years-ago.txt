How Tablighi movement split into two groups two years ago

MUMBAI: Tablighi Jamaat, the Islamic revivalist missionary movement, headquartered at Nizamuddin in Delhi, split into two factions two years ago following a dispute over the running of the organization. While the bigger faction is headquartered at Banglewali Masjid in Nizamuddin, the breakaway faction runs from a mosque in Nerul near Mumbai.

Founded by Maulana Mohammed Ilyas in 1926, the global Tablighi movement ran smoothly till Maulana Inamul Hasan was its Amir or head. Hasan, in his lifetime, set up a Shura or apex consultation body, for major decisions in the Jamaat. After Hasan’s death in 1995, his son Maulana Zubairul Hasan and another senior Tablighi member, Maulana Saad, co-led the Shura. After Maulana Zubairul Hasan died in March 2014, Maulana Saad became its sole head.

“After this, there were allegations of Maulana Saad taking decision arbitrarily which angered some senior members in the organization,” said a Mumbai-based cleric who has observed the Tablighi activities for years.

Two years ago, the differences led to a rift in the Tablighi movement dividing it into two factions. While Maulana Saad continued to head the main faction headquartered at Nizamuddin, the breakaway unit is being run by Maulana Ahmed Lad and Ibrahim Deola from a mosque at Nerul near Mumbai.

Different cities have zonal Markaz or centres which identify mosques to facilitate the stay of visiting Jamaats or groups. Normally a visiting group stays at a mosque for three days before they leave for the next destination or mosque. Mumbai has four centres located at four different mosques (Chuna Bhatti, Khar, Jogeshwari and Kurla Pipe Road). After clashes were reported at some mosques in Mumbai two years ago, the two factions began to take greater care in keeping their members away from each other to avoid clashes.
