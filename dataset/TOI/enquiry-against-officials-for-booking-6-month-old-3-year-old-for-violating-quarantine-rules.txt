UTTARKASHI: The revenue police of Chinyalisaur area booked as many as 45 people, including a six-month-old and a 3-year-old　child for violating quarantine norms during the lockdown.　On　getting　the　information, district　administration has removed the names of both the children, as　FIR under Juvenile Justice Act can't be registered against those under 8　years　of age. Administration has also set up an enquiry against the concerned officer for negligence.　

Sources said that the revenue police filed a case on April 11 against 47 people, including two children and their parents in New Khalsi village of Chinyalisaur block for floating home quarantine norms, on the basis of a report given by the magistrate deputed to oversee the area for Covid-19 cases. 

Soon after getting the notice, family members expressed resentment over filing of case against children. The district administration also immediately cancelled the complete report and said that action is being taken against the Covid-19 magistrate for filing wrong report without doing ground survey.

Akash Joshi, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Dunda said, "We have cancelled the complete report, as the officials concerned seemed to have made it without conducting any ground survey. District magistrate is also setting up an enquiry and suspending the Covid-19 magistrate for showing negligence in his duty."
