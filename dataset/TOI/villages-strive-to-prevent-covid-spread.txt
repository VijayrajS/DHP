Villages strive to prevent Covid-19 spread

HYDERABAD: Even as migrant workers make their way back, gram panchayats are ensuring that the returning workers, along with their family members, adhere to a compulsory 14-day quarantine in the villages so that there is no possible transmission of Covid-19.


The National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR), which is assisting the people with crisis management amid Covid-19 outbreak, said that in case the workers do not have a house of their own to self-quarantine or their house is too small for the same, the gram panchayat (GP) will have to make necessary arrangements by converting anganwadis or schools into quarantine centres or by establishing a makeshift quarantine space.

NIRDPR, in a release, revealed how sarpanches are dealing with the migrant workersâ€™ exodus to villages amid the crisis.
