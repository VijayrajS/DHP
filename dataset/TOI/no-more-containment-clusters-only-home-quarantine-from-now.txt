2020-05-08
HYDERABAD: With new positive cases becoming a daily norm, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has tweaked the concept of containment clusters and decided to quarantine only the house or the apartment of the affected, instead of locking down the entire locality. “We are imposing home containment and if needed we are locking the house from outside. As people complained of hardships due to containment clusters, the government decided to resort to home containment,” a GHMC official said.


Civic officials are pasting home quarantine stickers and a quarantine stamp is also put on the hand. After this the primary contacts are being probed. “Now we are only testing the primary contacts, who are having symptoms of coronavirus,” said a GHMC official. The houses contained and their primary contacts will be under vigil.

“The surveillance team will update us if the home quarantine guidelines are flouted. Action will be initiated against people flouting home quarantine rules. People can also report irregularities at 040 2111 1111,” sa id a GHMC official. In case of emergency, people who are home quarantined can approach GHMC by calling the same number. For vegetables mobile Rythu Bazars will be pressed into service in the localities where a house or building has been contained. 

On Thursday, municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) principal secretary Arvind Kumar held a meeting with GHMC officials on the coronavirus situation. Civic officials were instructed to ensure spraying of disinfectants continues in localities where positive cases are traced. “Even containment zones which are de-notified will be sanitised,” said a GHMC official. In the meeting it was also decided to seal markets and rythu bazars which do not follow social distancing. 

GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar, Hyderabad collector Shweta Mohanty and GHMC zonal commissioners attended the meeting.
