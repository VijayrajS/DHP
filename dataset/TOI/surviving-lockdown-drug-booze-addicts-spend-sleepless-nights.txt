Surviving lockdown: Drug & booze addicts spend sleepless nights
2020-04-11
KOTA: A clerk in a state government department in Bundi, 45-year-old Atul Kumar (name changed) hasn’t had a sound sleep for several days after lockdown was imposed. He goes to bed around 10pm but wakes up around 2am and remains awake till morning. 


A cannabis addict, Kumar used to get his daily dose from a licensed bhang shop of the excise department while returning home from duty.

“My wife gets irritated these days as I fail to get a sound sleep. I get restless and depression seems to have caught on me. My worries increase when my teenaged children ask if we will all die of coronavirus,” Kumar said while narrating his state of mind. 

“A little bhang used to relax my mind and help me get a sound sleep. The lockdown came into effect so suddenly that I could not manage to stock a bit of the narcotics,” he added. 

Forty-seven-year-old businessman Suresh Khatri manages his daily dose of alcohol from the black market by shelling out Rs 150-Rs 200 more than the MRP. On the other hand, Trilok Chand is not able to spend extra bucks for his booze and spends his days and nights restless and in anxiety. 

“If the situation continues to last for long, several people like me will go insane. Some will even commit suicide,” Chand said.

Not just them, but a large portion of the population is dependent on these intoxicants. Most of them have been facing the same sort of restlessness, anxiety and depression which might trigger various psychological and mental disorders.
