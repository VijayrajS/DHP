MEERUT: Priests performing the last rites of a Covid-19 victim held a protest at the crematorium in Meerut on Friday and demanded protective gears and sanitizers. On Friday, they consigned to flames the fourth patient who fell to novel coronavirus in the district.

“Even we have children at home. How can the authorities and families expect us to carry out the last rites when they themselves stand at a distance from the body? We were told that the body will be brought to the crematorium by a health department team. However, there was only one driver in proper personal protective gear. Policemen stood outside the crematorium and there were only two family members of the deceased to lift the body and conduct the cremation,” said Ramesh (who goes by his first name), the priest at Surajkund crematorium in Meerut.

He further said: “The family members had gloves on, but we had none. We should also be given gloves and sanitizers. At a time when there is so much fear about the disease, it is unfair to depend on us for the cremation without protection, and create pressure if we refuse to do so. Sanitisation of the crematorium should also be done.”

Later police intervened and the priests agreed to do the cremation, that too from a distance.

Abdur Rehman Siddiqui, station house officer of Civil Lines police station, said, “The priests agreed for the cremation eventually and it was conducted with proper rituals.”
