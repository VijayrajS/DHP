2020-05-09
Vadodara: Most may want to get discharged from a hospital as soon as possible, particularly if they are suffering with coronavirus infection.

But Aspak Yusuf Khalpa, a 30-year-old coronavirus patient, tested negative for coronavirus a few days ago and yet refuses to get discharged from the Chhota Udepur hospital. His wife Sayma (24) is still under treatment in the hospital and he doesn’t want to leave her alone.

“Aspak’s reports tested negative and his wife’s report was positive. So he refused to take discharge,” said chief district health officer Dr Mahesh Chaudhary. 

“Later his wife tested negative twice, so she was discharged on Thursday, but then we had to test Aspak again before discharge as per the protocol,” Chaudhary added. 

Aspak’s tests were conducted which turned out to be negative and he was allowed to leave on Friday.

“I wanted to be with Sayma as her reports were positive. It was easy to follow social distancing norms as there were just three patients in the isolation ward and I had my mask on all the time,” Aspak told TOI.

The couple, living in Chhota Udepur town, was admitted to the hospital from government quarantine facility on April 24 after they tested positive for the virus. They had reportedly contracted the virus from one of their family members, Irshad Khalpa.

With Aspak getting discharged on Friday, only one patient – Uzair Ranger – remains under treatment now as his consecutive tests have been positive. 

Health officials in the district counselled him to consume more fluids and not to skip any medicines.
