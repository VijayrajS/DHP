2020-03-18
PATNA: With a view to preventing the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19), the state transport department has banned the use of curtains and distribution of blankets in air-conditioned (AC) buses till March 31. 


A decision in this regard was taken by transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal at a meeting with bus operators, autorickshaw associations and private taxi operators on Tuesday.

“Curtains and blankets have to be removed from AC buses to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Passengers can, however, bring their own blankets and use masks,” Agarwal said.

He added, “All city, inter-city and inter-state buses, which arrive at and depart from Bankipore depot and Mithapur stand, have to be fumigated. The bus terminus will also be sanitised. Auto drivers and private taxi aggregators, on the other hand, have to clean their vehicles with bleaching powder twice a day.”

Agarwal, who is also Patna’s divisional commissioner, laid emphasis on maintenance of personal hygiene as well. He asked cab and bus operators to provide hand sanitizers to all passengers and told private motorbike aggregators to give plastic headgears to pillion riders.

“We have constituted different teams in all districts to ensure that preventive measures are being taken. They will conduct awareness campaigns across Bihar to tell people about ways to maintain hygiene to stop the spread of Covid-19. Each team comprises district transport officers, motor vehicle inspectors and enforcement sub-inspectors,” the transport secretary said, adding, “If any bus operator fails to follow the instructions, his permit will be cancelled.”
