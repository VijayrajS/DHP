TRICHY: As the migrant labourers and students stranded in other states started arriving in Trichy, the district administration has enhanced the procedure of screening them before keeping them in home quarantine.

Nine people including three labourers from Gujarat and six students from Maharashtra reached Trichy on Wednesday. They were screened for symptoms of Covid-19. Since none of them had any symptoms, they were sent to home quarantine for 14 days.

A Balamurugan, 41, of Badharpettai near Thuraiyur district, a heavy vehicle driver carrying wings of windmill in Baroda, was one among them. He shared the ordeal of being stranded at his company in Baroda. He was among the nine Tamil Nadu residents stuck there since then the lockdown.

Bored of staying indoors for several weeks, he and his colleagues came to a local shop a few days ago and found a passenger vehicle having a seating capacity of 25 from Tamil Nadu carrying 10 people to Kolkata. “We asked the driver whether he can take us on his return trip to Tamil Nadu. The driver agreed and took us on board and ten of us reached Krishnagiri. Three of us travelled to Trichy and six others from various districts had gone to their native districts,” he said.

Upon their arrival, the health department officials screened them at Trichy collector office.
