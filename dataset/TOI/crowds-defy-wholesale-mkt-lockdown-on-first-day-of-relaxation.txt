2020-04-16
Bareilly: A day after district Vyapar Mandal members met magistrate Nitish Kumar to extract a two-hour relief for the market at Shyamganj to operate from 10 am to 6 pm, instead of 4 am to 10 am, hundreds of people thronged the area on Wednesday, making a mockery of lockdown in the city, as the wholesale market for groceries, etc, remained open for the extended period.There were hundreds of people on the roads of Shyamganj’s wholesale market area lining up to buy grocery and other essentials on wholesale, as most shops remained open throughout the day. Earlier, only a few designated shops were being allowed to keep open during the stipulated time.Speaking to TOI, president, UP Udyog Vyapar Mandal, Rajendra Gupta said, “Ever since the lockdown came into force, a few shopkeepers and traders in Shaymganj were being allowed to open their shops, that too, between 4 am and 10 am. Even then, people were assembling near these shops to buy essentials. We thought by shifting the opening time from 4 am to 10 am and extending it till late evening, we’ll make it easier for everyone, as buyers won’t crowd knowing shops will remain open for a longer duration. But things didn’t go as per plan.”He added, “We wanted to ensure that social distancing was maintained, but it happened otherwise. Looking at the situation, we decided to withdraw our request and have asked the administration to take appropriate measures. We’ll follow whatever guidelines are now given.”DM Nitish Kumar told TOI, “We’ve called for another meeting with members of Vyapar Mandal, following which, a decision will taken regarding the time period for which shops in the area will remain open. Since most of them are grocery stores and sell essentials, these won’t be shut and it is likely that a few shop owners, traders will be granted permission to open shops for a shorter period like before. We’ll also focus on home delivery to ensure that lockdown guidelines and social distancing are maintained.”
