Visakhapatnam: Sale of liquor will escalate Covid-19, crime, fear experts
2020-05-05
VISAKHAPATNAM: Social distancing measures went for a toss as people thronged liquor outlets even in containment zones as soon as liquor shops opened shutters on Monday morning.

Doctors, social psychologists, activists, lawyers and NGOs said opening liquor shops is counter-productive and efforts taken to contain the virus will be meaningless in view of Monday’s chaos. Experts added that besides Covid-19 cases, instances of domestic violence, child abuse and crime and accidents under the influence of alcohol will also escalate.

The NGO, Nature, on behalf of other social organisations, will give a representation to the chief minister’s office (CMO), the Union ministry of home affairs and Niti Aayog for both Centre and state governments to reconsider their decision and continue with the ban on sale of liquor, said S Balaraju, executive director of Nature. 

Dr S Radharani, medical superintendent and professor of psychiatry at Government Hospital for Mental Care (GHMC) said, “The ban could have been extended for another two weeks or till month-end. It is not at all a good idea to encourage people to step out to buy alcohol as social distancing norms are violated even in red zones.”

Advocate and child rights activist Abdul Raqueeb said, “Black marketing of liquor, stocking up by middlemen will increase now and alcohol in the possession of rowdy sheeters, unemployed youth, students, poor people will only worsen the situation. While Covid control measures have gone for a toss and damage is done in a single day, more alcohol-related crimes like abusing children and domestic violence will also take place now when the excise and criminal courts are mostly closed.”

Sociologist and retired professor of social work at Andhra University ABSV Ranga Rao said if the government is keen to keep wine shops open, enforcement of social distancing and other guidelines should be followed and sale should be limited between 7 am to 11 am.
