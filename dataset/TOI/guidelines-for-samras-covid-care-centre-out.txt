Guidelines for Samras Covid care centre out
2020-05-01
Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal corporation issued a set of guidelines asking people who have tested positive for Covid but are asymptomatic and are being kept at Samras Hostel to clean their own rooms and stay indoors. It also advicsed them to get as much rest as possible. 

The guidelines state that those admitted will have to clean the lobby area near their rooms. The guidelines say patients should not spit in the lobby or out the window. Also, food provided has to be consumed in the room only and in no circumstance should one leave the room with food.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra confirmed that the AMC has issued the guidelines and are announcing them on the public address system in the hostel. However, about residents being made to clean the lobby, Nehra said this was ordered initially, but AMC staff is now doing this. As all residents are Covid-19 positive, they will have to clean their own rooms as sanitation workers could be infected if they do it.

The AMC has also warned these asymptomatic patients that any violation of these directions could invite action under the Epidemic Diseases Act. The AMC directs patients not to share buckets, chairs, or beds with other patients. The guidelines also make it mandatory for staff supplying food to wear mask and gloves.

AMC warns that the entire hostel is under CCTV surveillance and any breach will invite punitive action.
