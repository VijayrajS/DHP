HYDERABAD: Health department is gearing up to put in place safety measures for medical staff and their family members as they are vulnerable. Preparations are underway to firm up a roster system to maintain self-imposed quarantine for five days on rotation basis. Doctors, staff nurses, paramedics and outsource staff have to maintain the self-imposed quarantine for five days after working for an equal number of days.


According to instructions issued (a copy available with TOI) to all teaching hospitals, government medical colleges and speciality hospitals under the Directorate of Medical Education (DME), one-third staff have to maintain self-imposed quarantine for five days. After the quarantine period, they have to duly report otherwise their quarantine period would not be considered as “ on duty” and strict action would be taken against them. Currently, the hospital administration is preparing lists of personnel to be in quarantine.


 
The instructions also clarified that doctors should not carry out any private practice and mingle with the general public during the quarantine period. Health of the staff in quarantine would be monitored. If they display any symptoms, they would not be sent home. Also, transport facility would be made available to the medical staff to go the hospitals. The government is also taking measures to provide accommodation on the hospital premises or rented accommodation in nearby areas.A clarity on these measures would emerge in a few days.

Meanwhile, a few post-graduate medical students said they were finding it difficult to get accommodation in nearby hospitals. “It is problem for those staying in private residences and we hope to find a solution soon,” a PG doctor said on the condition of anonymity.
