2020-04-16
KOLHAPUR: A proposal has been sent by Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College and Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Rugnalaya (CPR) to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for setting up a Covid-19 testing laboratory at the civil hospital.


Minakshi Gajbhiye, dean of the hospital, said setting up the laboratory will cost around 1.22 crore and it will include all the latest lab equipment and renovation of an existing room in the medical college.

"We are awaiting response from the ICMR that is likely to come in the next couple of days. Considering the current requirement of the district and the time taken at the existing laboratory in Miraj, having a lab in Kolhapur will save precious time and help in making quick decisions," Gajbhiye said.

Being asked about the low sample carrying capacity of the Miraj lab, Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said the current lab has manual RNA extractor which takes time in testing.

"Hence, the number of samples taken in a batch gets restricted. We have ordered an auto-extractor which will save a lot of time. Due to the technical issues, it is yet to reach us. Once it does, the lab will function full-fledged," he said.

Chaudhary added that they have also joined hands with private companies that have provided few equipment. "Once the auto-extractor and other equipment are installed, the sample carrying capacity will increase to 150 samples per batch." he said.

"Once the lab starts functioning to its full capacity, it will provide speedy results and eventually rapid implementation of safety and security measures against Covid-19 across the Sangli, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg districts could take place," he added.
