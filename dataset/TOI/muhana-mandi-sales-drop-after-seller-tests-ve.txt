JAIPUR: Business in Muhana mandi here has gone down by 35% in the last two days after a papaya seller tested positive on Wednesday. 

Apart from the papaya seller at the mandi, many vegetable sellers in the city also tested positive for coronavirus creating a fear among people which has affected the sale of vegetables.

Karan Singh Jodha, an official at Muhana mandi, said, maintaining social distancing at the vegetable market is a herculean task. “Business has gone down by 35% to 40% due to the fear of coronavirus. We are, however, trying to maintain social distancing. Earlier, a vegetable seller was allotted three wooden platforms to sell his product. Now, to increase the distancing between the sellers, we have allotted them six platforms. Masks and sanitisers are regularly being provided to them,” Jodha said.

During the lockdown, all businesses have been shut in the city which has increased unemployment rate. Selling vegetables was seen as a silver lining in the time of crisis as this was one of the few professions which were allowed to function. Hundreds of street vendors and people from different professions started selling vegetables that increased crowd at the mandi.

Rahul Tanvar, president of Muhana Mandi Association, said, “The rise in unemployment increased crowd in the mandi which made social distancing difficult. As all the eateries and restaurants are closed, the sale is down, but the harvest season is at its peak. Due to low demand and fear in purchasing vegetables, farm produce is sold at half rate. This year has been really bad for both farmers and businessmen.”
