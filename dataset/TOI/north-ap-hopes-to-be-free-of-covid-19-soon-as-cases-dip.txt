VISAKHAPATNAM: While no Covid-19 cases have been reported in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram so far, 20 cases have been reported in Visakhapatnam. The region did not register a single new positive case in the last one week. District authorities, although refusing to let down their guards, are seeing this as a positive sign.


The north Andhra region, comprising Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts, has a population of around 95 lakh. Visakhapatnam district alone has a population of 47 lakh. While 20 positive cases were reported from the districts, so far there has been no deaths due to Covid-19. Besides, four of the 20 positive patients have been discharged from the hospitals. So, as on Monday, the number of positive cases came down to 16.

 


Visakhapatnam collector V Vinay Chand said the situation in Visakhapatnam is improving. “There have been no fresh cases in the district in the last one week till Monday. We hope the trend will continue and the existing cases would recover soon,” he told TOI.

Srikakulam SP RN Ammi Reddy echoed the collector’s thoughts. “If neighbouring Visakhapatnam recovers, we hope the region becomes the first in the state to be free of the disease,” he said. Ammi Reddy added that all stakeholders, including medical, health and police apart from the general public have played a supportive role in preventing the spread of the disease.

Meanwhile, G Suneel Kumar, senior divisional commercial manager of Waltair division of East Coast Railways, said the division has kept 60 coaches ready to be used as isolation facilities in case of an emergency.
