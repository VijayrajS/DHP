Coronavirus claims owner of Jaipur‘quarantine hotel’
2020-04-19
JAIPUR: The owner of a hotel in city’s Kanti Nagar near Polo Victory, which was initially converted into a quarantine centre for suspected cases of coronavirus, died of Covid-19 on Saturday. A day earlier, health officials had taken a group of over 30 people to this hotel for keeping them under quarantine.

This has raised a serious question mark on the functioning of the district administration and the health department, as this group of people was taken to a hotel whose owner was Covid-19 positive. The group was, however, transferred to another centre within hours on Friday, primarily because of resistance from the local people, who were opposed to the hotel in the middle of a residential area turning into a quarantine centre.

The hotel owner had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 14 and was admitted to a hospital the next day. He died on Saturday morning. But on April 17, health officials had kept the group of 30-plus people to his hotel for a few hours.
