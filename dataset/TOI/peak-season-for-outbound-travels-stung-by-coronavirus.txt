Peak season for outbound travels stung by Coronavirus
2020-03-08
AURANGABAD: Local tour operators and travel agents have ended up in gloom as the bookings made for foreign travel in advance have been cancelled while there are hardly any new bookings. 


Meanwhile, the season for inbound travellers which lasts from December to March is down as tourists are avoiding the risk to travelling to the country. 

According to Syed Naser, a tour operator in Him Musafir, in order to benefit from cheaper fares, people tend to book their tickets a month or two in advance. “Most of these bookings done by local residents have been cancelled due to the fear of coronavirus. The bookings for business trips to China, Japan and South Korea worth Rs 12-15 lakh have been cancelled,” Naser said.

Awes Hanfi of Girikhand Travels Pvt. Ltd. said that coronavirus scare has impacted 90% of the travel and ticketing business for summer season.
