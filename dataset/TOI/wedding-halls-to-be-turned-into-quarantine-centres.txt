BHUBANESWAR: The government on Monday decided to turn kalyan mandaps, community centres, cyclone shelters, shelters for the urban homeless and other government and private buildings into temporary quarantine units to house suspected coronavirus patients, if necessary.


The government has empowered all municipal commissioners of corporations and executive officers of municipalities to do so.

In its directive, the government said the exterior and the interiors of the buildings identified for quarantine purposes should be redone. “If required, facility management agencies may be engaged to manage the centres,” the precautionary note said. All buildings meant for quarantine should be sanitized and dedicated teams should be deployed for maintenance, monitoring and housekeeping, it added.

“Specific teams should be formed on a cluster-approach basis to oversee the sanitary condition and health status of their localities,” said the advisory sent to the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

The government said ward officers would keep in touch with the community to get updated information on the health of people. “Swachh Sathis engaged to manage solid waste should be extensively used for collecting information on the presence of foreigners and persons who have visited other countries in the past 15 days,” the advisory further reads.

The government has also decided to use water-spraying machines in each Aahaar centre and public toilet. The latter would be equipped with soap, it said.

The government has asked municipal corporation and municipality heads to run Information Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns to generate public awareness.

“The ULBs have been authorised to spend funds on this. They have been asked to coordinate with the district collectors and the health department officials as well,” the advisory said.
