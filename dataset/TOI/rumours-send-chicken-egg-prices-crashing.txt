Covid-19 scare: Rumours send chicken, egg prices crashing
2020-03-16
VISAKHAPATNAM: With rumours linking chicken and eggs with coronavirus, their prices have nose-dived in the city. On Sunday, the price of a kilo of chicken hovered around Rs 70 to Rs 80 and eggs sold for Rs 4 a piece. But despite slashing prices, chicken and egg shops looked deserted as there were hardly any takers.

“Earlier, on Sundays around two to two and half lakh birds or hens used to be sold in the city. But last Sunday, we could not even sell a lakh birds and this Sunday the figure is even less,” said Visakha Broiler Poultry Association president T Adinarayana.

With chicken, the sale and price of eggs have also gone south. On Sunday, the wholesale price of eggs was Rs 355 (per hundred eggs) and the retail price was Rs 4 per piece.

“In 2006 when birdflu broke out, prices of eggs had reached an all-time low of Rs 350 (per 100). After 14 years we are seeing the trend again. But at least there was a valid reason in 2006, the present situation is due to rumour,” said Uday Bhaskar, district chairman of National Egg Coordination Committee.

The rumours linking eggs and chicken with Covid-19 surfaced on social media platforms in mid-January. Old videos showing mass culling of hens started being circulation with claims that Covid-19 virus is also affecting hens. 

The impact has been considerable with many switching to a vegetarian diet and restaurant owners revising their daily menu.

“Orders for non-vegetarian dishes have reduced considerably. In fact, we have stopped buying live chicken and have been buying frozen chicken. That too, in low quantities. The idea is to avoid wastage,”said Ravi Kumar Pothela, owner of a prominent restaurant in the city that specialises in Andhra cuisine.
