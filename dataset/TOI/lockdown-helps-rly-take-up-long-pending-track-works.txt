2020-05-06
Trichy: Utilizing the lockdown period, long pending track maintenance works in the Trichy railway division have commenced. Several minor works which have been ignored by the department owing to frequent movement of trains are being fixed for smooth running of trains, officials said. Although the railway department incurred loss due to suspension of passenger and express trains during the lockdown, it has come as a relief for authorities to execute it without any interruption. Railway authorities have undertaken various works to improve safety and operational efficiency of trains, officials said.Welding, rail renewal works, packing of ballast and clearing overgrowth are the works undertaken across the Trichy railway division by maintaining proper social distancing. The process of detecting minute track defects is also being carried out which will help reduce shaking or jerking during train operation. “Each and every inch of the track is being examined and would pave way for safe and efficient operation of trains, officials said. Examination and replacement of rails at level crossings would be done periodically. “To execute any work at the level crossings, permission from the district administration and traffic police is required to stop vehicular traffic across the railway gate. Over a period of time, the tracks have been buried due to vehicular traffic. That should be relayed properly. That process is also possible without closing the level crossing,” officials said. Meanwhile, to take up special works, authorities from the engineering department have sought permission from the district collector. Once they get the nod, they would begin work within a few days, an official from Trichy railway division said.
