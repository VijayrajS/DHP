2020-03-13
Nagpur: The coronavirus scare has affected international traffic at the Nagpur airport. Sources in the airport said the passenger traffic has come down by 36% as compared to normal times. 

Two international carriers — Air Arabia and Qatar Airways — operate from Nagpur.

A senior official in the airport management said Air Arabia has cut down its operations to two flights a week from the earlier four. Even as Qatar Airways continues to maintain its seven-day-a-week frequency, its passengers have come down to an average of 40 to 45 in a single flight as against 60 to 65 earlier.

“The overall decline in terms of passengers through international flights comes to around 36%,” said the official.

Screening of passengers continues at the airport. Special measures have been taken for the CISF personnel too who are at risk of direct exposure to the passengers while frisking and carrying out other security procedures.

“The personnel have been provided with safety equipment like sanitisers, gloves and masks according to the safety guidelines issued to us,” said a senior official in the CISF.
