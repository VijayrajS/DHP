Airline Frauds in the name of Covid
2020-05-31
There are cases where flights were rescheduled prior to lockdown announcement. Some citizens had opted for cancellation with full refund prior to lockdown. Now airlines are not issuing refund to such eligible customers. In my case, I got flight reschedule message on 7th Mar and I opted to cancel my ticket with full refund. Airline cancelled my ticket with full refund remark. My refund was in process. In between lockdown was announced. Now airline n agents are not issuing refund by taking lockdown measures as an excuse. Kindly contact me for more details. Madhur 9503022425
