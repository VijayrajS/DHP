2020-05-31
JAMSHEDPUR: The girlfriend of a tribal youth sneaked into the quarantine centre he was lodged at on Thursday night and the duo eloped from there, sources at the isolation centre said. The matter came to light on Friday morning when breakfast was being served. As soon as the news spread, the district officials informed Chandra’s family and tried to find out if he and his girlfriend had reached home.


Chandra Mohan Hansda (22) was put in quarantine with 10 others at the Nutandih Primary School, 45km from the Steel City, when he returned from Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh on May 24. Chandra’s friend and neighbour Ramesh Hansda said, “The two have been in love for two years but they could not marry as they belonged to different tribes. They had tried to elope twice earlier, but their family members managed to catch them and bring them back,” Hansda added. 

Chandra’s father, Ropai Hansda, blamed the administration officials for not keeping an eye on his son at the centre and questioned how an inmate can escape from a secure centre.
