Aurangabad: In view of new Covid-19 cases emerging in the city, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has announced the implementation of a revised strategy on Covid-19 prevention and management in city.

Municipal officer of health Nita Padalkar on Thursday said that the new strategy is aimed at isolation of suspect and confirmed cases. “According to the plan, 12 centres have been identified as fever clinics including four AMC centres, six centres facilitated by Indian Medical Association (IMA) and two private hospitals,” Padalkar said. 

Samaj Kalyan Hostel at Qile Ark, MGM Sports Complex, Emergency Operating Centre (EOC) at Padampura, MIT Hostel, Dhoot Hospital, MGM Hospital, IMA Hall, IMA Cidco N-2 Mahajan Colony, IMA Jawahar Colony, IMA Badhkar Gate, IMA M-2 TV Centre and IMA Kanchanwadi will work as fever clinics.

“Those who have a travel history or had come in contact with a Covid-19 patient or have symptoms should only visit one of these 12 fever clinics where they will be screened,” Padalkar said.

People with mild symptoms and upper respiratory tract infection will be considered suspects and they will be placed under isolation at one of the four of Covid-19 care centres. The Samaj Kalyan Hostel, MGM Sports Complex, EOC Padampura and MIT Hostel with combined bed capacity of 610 beds will be serving as Covid-19 care centres. They will facilitate throat swab collection and admission.

“If the patients at the Covid-19 care centres test negative, they will be treated and discharged. But if they test positive, they will be moved to one of the dedicated Covid-19 health centres (DCHCs). “District civil hospital with 220 beds, MGM Hospital with 500 beds and Dhoot Hospital with 200 beds are the three DCHCs identified in city. Patients with pneumonia and no sign of severe disease will be treated at these centres,” Padalkar said.
