At central jail, a lockdown of a different kind
2020-03-18
Panaji: With 539 inmates, undertrials and convicts included, Colvale Central jail is gearing up to deal with a potential Covid-19 threat. Prisons authority has decided to suspend interviews with prisoners by visitors till March 31.
 

Voluntary organisations engaged in reformatory activities will not be able to engage with inmates till March 31, an inspector general of prison (IGP) official said. 

He added that the entire jail premises will be sanitised and an isolation facility will be created if any inmate needs to be quarantined. “Those who are returning from parole, will be kept separately,” he said. 

The modern jail has 10 isolation cubicles that are normally use to temporarily lodge inmates who turn violent or are a cause of disturbance to other jail mates even after a warning is sounded. 

“Those cells are rarely used and are currently not in use,” said a jail official at Colvale prison. 

The IGP official, however, said they have adequate empty blocks that can be used as a quarantine facility, if needed. Unlike other prisons in the country, ours is not over crowded, he said.

Besides, new undertrials will be kept separately. “Our jail premises are clean and hygiene is maintained but extra measures will be taken,” he added.

Currently, jail inmates are allowed two hours of outdoor activity each in the first and second half of the day. “Jail inmates will now be allowed out of their cells—within jail premises either working or playing—for five hours a day to reduce chances of them getting exposed to the virus in the cell,” he said. 

The thermal gun to record temperature of persons entering jail premises will be procured as will hand sanitizers. Inquiries were initiated to make the purchases on Monday.
