Agra: Mohammad Haidar (22), who worked at Allana meat factory, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his house in Aligarh on Sunday. He was depressed from the ongoing lockdown and feared of losing his job and salary for this month, said family members.

Haidar’s maternal uncle Mohammed Rashid said he was the only son of his parents, and that his father had passed away years ago. Since then, he was staying with his widowed mother. Rashid said he was repeatedly telling his mother of not getting salary due to the lockdown.

On Sunday morning, when Haidar did not come out of his room, his married sister, who had come home during Ramadan, went to his room to find it was locked from inside. She knocked the door several times, but he did not respond. She then jumped to the terrace of the neighbouring house to check through the window and found him hanging. 

She immediately informed her mother and police. Civil Lines police reached the spot and after completing formalities, sent the body for postmortem.

A former Samajwadi Party MLA from Aligarh, Haji Zameerullah Khan, also reached their home and said the youth was upset due to the lockdown. He said, “When the lockdown was extended till May 17, he became more depressed and took the extreme step.”
