Trichy: The health department of Trichy railway division has established an isolation ward with 12 beds at Golden Rock Railway hospital following instructions from the railway board after more coronavirus (Covid - 19) cases were reported from across the country.Patients coming to the hospital with suspected cold and fever are admitted to the isolation ward before sending them to the government hospital for further medical examination and observation. Medical officers in the railway division have been instructed to isolate people who have fever. For the purpose, every railway hospital should have isolation wards with necessary protective gear, chief medical superintendent Dr Soundarrajan said.“As many as 500 to 600 outpatients visit the hospital every day. We have two non-touch thermometers to examine the patients who would arrive here with cold and fever. If anyone found with Covid-19 symptoms, they would be quarantined at the isolation ward for a brief time before sending them to the government hospital,” he said.If any suspicious coronavirus cases are reported in any of the railway hospitals or health units in the division, that should be informed to the board immediately. However, as of now, they have not encountered any such cases for far, he said.“As per the instruction, we are in constant touch with the district as well as state health authorities to obtain the guidelines on the subject in order to follow necessary measures,” Soundarrajan said.To create awareness among the railway employees as well as commuters, flex boards bearing ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ would be fixed at all the railway stations tomorrow, the medical superintendent said.Meanwhile, the number of medical staff who are engaged in the Covid-19 screening process in Trichy international airport has been increased to 22 from 15, as the passengers arriving from across the world at the airport are being screened, health officials from the airport said.Airport health officer Dr Subin told TOI that since January 28, they have been screening passengers arriving from Singapore and via China. However, as the virus seemed intensified in India, they have started screening all passengers who arrive here from overseas destinations.“We have commenced universal screening. Strength of our medical team would go up as state health department will send more medical staff,” he added.
