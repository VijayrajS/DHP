MP Pollution Control Board chief chemist Dr DK Waghela said, “Almost all basic parameters that makes water pure and suitable for aquatic life has improved. This is due to less human interference due to lockdown and a sharp decline in industrial activity.” 

Turbidity in water bodies has reduced to as low as 3.8 NTU, the laboratory report issued by pollution control board showed. Samples taken from water bodies of Indore in lockdown period were compared with the levels in early march. 

As per findings of the board, pH levels in most water bodies have gone up with lowest recorded at Yeshwant Sagar at 8.2 and highest at Pipaliyapala at 8.26. Levels of dissolved oxygen has also improved in water bodies with Bilawali recorded 7.6 mg/L, Sirpur 7.5 mg/L, Yeshwant Sagar 7.6 mg/L and Pipliayapala 7.8 mg/L, showed study by Pollution Control Board.

Experts said as basic parameters defining water quality has improved it will support aquatic life and aid in breading of fishes.

Total Coliform has also reduced in water bodies indicating supporting system for aquatic organisms. 

In Bilawali, Total Coliform have dropped to 70 MPN/100ml as against 120 MPN/100ml calculated before the lockdown. 

Lowest level of Total Coliform was recorded at Sirpur Lake, where it dropped to 48 MPN/100ml from 84 MPN/100ml recorded earlier in March. 

The biological oxygen demand (BOD) in water has also dropped in most water bodies of Indore, according to study done by the pollution control board.
