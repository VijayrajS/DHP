DEHRADUN: In an interactive video conference titled “Atal-E-Samvaad” on Wednesday, state education minister Arvind Pandey said that schools will reopened and board exams held as soon as the lockdown is lifted. Several village leaders, parents, students and teachers participated in the conference through screens installed in in 500 state government schools. The conference was aimed to review the new initiatives taken by the education department to continue studies amid the lockdown. 

Responding to queries, Pandey said that the remaining board exams will be finished within a four-day period and a schedule will be released 10 days in advance. 

People also raised the issue of being unable to clear doubts during the telecast of lessons for classes 9, 10 and 12 on Doordarshan Uttarakhand. The education minister said that the queries of the students will be collected by their respective education officers and a separate telecast will be broadcast, answering those. 

“We have also asked gram pradhans to assess if schools in their villages need more resources. There has been a lot of reverse migration recently, which might increase the load on schools,” added the education minister.
