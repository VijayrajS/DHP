Yavatmal: A rumour regarding ‘virus attack on tomatoes’ has gained currency in the region. Rumour mongers have been spreading messages to the effect that “the most dangerous virus has attacked tomatoes”, terming it "tiranga virus" and calling it deadlier than coronavirus. As per the rumour, if ‘infected tomatoes’ are consumed by humans, it will “endanger their life”.

Taking cognisance of the situation, farm activist Manish Jadhav of Mahagaon tehsil has lodged a complaint at the local police station, requesting cops to file an FIR against rumour mongers. 

"We demand that the agriculture minister clarify this and remove the fear from the minds of people", Jadhav told TOI on Saturday.

“Farmers are trapped in an unprecedented financial crisis. Their vegetables are rotting in farms due to the lockdown. The tiranga virus rumour has added fuel to the fire,” Jadhav added. 

As per Jadhav, Mahagaon tehsil in Yavatmal district is one of the largest tomato-producing areas in the state.

Tomato growers took 1.5 quintals of tomatoes to Wardha market on Saturday, but there were no takers for them, leading to heavy loss for farmers.
