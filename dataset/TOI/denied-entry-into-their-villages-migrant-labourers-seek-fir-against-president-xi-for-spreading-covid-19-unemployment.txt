2020-04-01
Bareilly: A group of migrant labourers from Lakhimpur Kheri and Nepal, who were working in Maharashtra, Delhi and other states, have given a written complaint to local police seeking action against China’s President Xi Jinping for spreading Covid-19 pandemic across the world.

Main complainant Pinku Kumar, who is a resident of Palia town, was not allowed to enter his village and was forced to stay in the quarantine camp. Another complainant, Sanjay Kumar, also belongs to Lakhimpur Kheri district and he had reached his hometown after travelling for nearly five days and spending much part of his savings. 

In their complaint, the migrants also said that Jinping is responsible for all the deaths, lockdown and unemployment, “so he should be booked and compensation should be provided to the affected people”. Circle Officer Rakesh Nayak has received a copy of the complaint from them and handed over to the Palia SHO.

Palia SHO Vidhya Shankar Shukla told TOI, “A group of labourers have collectively given a complaint and asked for action against Xi Jinping for spreading novel coronavirus and unemployment. We cannot register an FIR on such a complaint and have forwarded the complaint to the SSP. Police and district administration are ensuring that proper food is provided to the migrants until they are quarantined.”
