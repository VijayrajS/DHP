GAYA: Two passengers reportedly showing Covid-19 symptoms landed at the Gaya airport on Saturday afternoon sparking panic and a flurry of activities among the airport staff. The flyers, said to be residents of Gorakhpur in UP, arrived from Thailand in a Bangkok-Gaya flight belonging to Thai Smile Airways, airport officials said.

Prompt crew members had alerted the airport officials about the health condition of the two flyers on board and on arrival, they were immediately segregated and taken out of the airport through a separate gate. “The two travellers have been sent to the isolation ward of ANMMCH in Muzaffarpur. Samples of blood and throat swab of the suspects would be sent for proper testing,” Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said, adding, “Initial reports had put the number of Covid-19 suspects on board at five.”

Altogether 12 passengers arrived by the Thai Smile Airways flight from Bangkok. The other 10 passengers have been advised home isolation by the medical team attending at the airport. They have been asked to strictly follow the social distancing protocol.

Though the ANMMCH superintendent Dr Vijay Krishna Prasad could not be reached despite several calls made at his official number, sources said the two isolated flyers are suffering from high fever and respiratory problems.

Airport Director Dilip Kumar said, “The Thai Smile plane was thoroughly disinfected and it subsequently took off for Bangkok with 120 passengers, all of them foreign nationals.”
