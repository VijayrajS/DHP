Government Covid cover for healthworkers gets just 27 claims
2020-06-15
MUMBAI: The government’s Covid-19 insurance policy covering over 22 lakh healthcare providers for Rs 50 lakh each, issued by New India Assurance, had received just 27 eligible claims till Friday. While nearly 75 claims were lodged, due to lack of awareness, most were ineligible as there were applications from non-healthcare cases and claims for deaths unrelated to the coronavirus.


New India Assurance is looking at ways to keep the policy, which expires on June 30, open for claims to ensure that the entire premium of over Rs 100 crore that it has collected from the government is distributed. The insurance scheme was funded through the health ministry’s NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) budget.

Despite keeping the process straightforward, there have been disputes because of multiple claimants in some cases. Speaking to TOI, New India Assurance chairman Atul Sahai said the company has so far settled six claims, several of which were paid in a day. “Keeping in mind the sensitivity, we have authorised all regional offices to settle claims immediately. Because this is an unnamed policy, we have to decide on the coverage going strictly by the definition.” Given the trend, the company expects total claims to be within 50.

Unlike health or life insurance, where coverage is not restricted to a particular ailment, the government went for a group personal accident cover, which is limited to death due to Covid-19. The policy is a Rs 50-lakh-death benefit cover for healthcare providers and community health workers who are in direct contact with Covid-19 patients and extends to private healthcare staff roped in by the government. The claim procedure has also been kept straightforward — a death certificate and a certificate from the nodal officer. The beneficiary has been defined as the one named by the claimant in their gratuity application.
