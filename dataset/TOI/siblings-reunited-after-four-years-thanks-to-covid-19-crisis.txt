Ballari: Thanks to the efforts of the officers in charge of handling the migrants leaving and returning to Karnataka, two siblings estranged for four years were reunited. A 20-year-old woman was reunited with her brother, 25, both of whom are residents of Latur village in Maharashtra. 

Supriya Joshi had been working at a hotel in Hospet in Ballari district, while her elder brother Prasanna Joshi, a teacher in Latur, had registered a complaint about his sister being missing. However, on March 23, when Hospet was declared a containment zone, she was forced to move into ‘Shantidhama’, where those rendered homeless by the Covid-19 crisis were housed in Ballari district. 

Supriya, however, was reportedly not very cooperative in divulging personal details to the officers, whom she allegedly abused. Officers meanwhile grouped her under the category of ‘drug addicts’, and her picture was posted online so as to help her relatives trace her. 

Deputy director of women and child welfare department B Nagraj said that they posted Supriya’s photograph on our Facebook page, which Prasanna Joshi chanced to visit and was able to identify his sister. “Prasanna subsequently contacted us, and Supriya too identified him as her brother, much to our delight,” Nagraj told TOI. 

Prasanna was the picture of elation when, after finding his sister’s whereabouts, he rushed to Ballari and beheld her after four years. “She identified me immediately. It was a happy reunion,” he said. 

Ballari deputy commissioner SS Nakul said that they had tested both siblings for Covid-19, and both of them had tested negative for the fatal infection. “I am very happy that the siblings have been reunited,” Nakul said. 

Nagraj said that they had verified Prasanna’s Aadhaar, PAN card, his address, all of which were confirmed prior to entrusting Supriya to his care.
