PUNE: The city police helped the Pune Municipal Corporation track down 100 Covid-19 positive patients in the past 30 days during the contact tracing exercise.

The police tracked down over 2,500 people coming in direct contact with positive patients. The information about them was passed on to the civic and medical authorities. Subsequently, these people were quarantined and checked. The Covid-19 positive patients were then shifted to hospitals.

A team comprising additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale, assistant commissioner of police (crime) Shivaji Pawar and inspector Sunil Gavali have been continuously working on details of the positive patients to contain the spread of the virus through timely intervention.

The contact tracing team collected the call data records and cellphone locations of the infected persons and tracked the people who directly came in contact with the former, Morale said. The team was still tracing suspected positive persons in the city and alerting the civic officials, he said.

The police identified a few employees of shopping malls, who later tested positive for the virus. Subsequently, the malls in Erandwane, Sahakarnagar and Kondhwa were sealed. The police team also tracked visitors to the malls, who came in contact with the salesmen. They were told to visit nearby hospitals to get themselves tested.

Morale said the information was passed on to the civic hospital authorities without any delay. The medical teams tested these people and 100 of them tested positive.

“These people had come in contact with the positive persons for only a couple of minutes. Had they been neglected, they would have infected many others,” he said.
