PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will perform the last rites of Covid-19 victims if their family members are unwilling or unable to do so.


The PMC was recently in a fix after relatives of a Covid-19 patient, who died at the Sassoon hospital here, refused to perform the last rites. It sought guidance from the Centre as to how to deal with the situation. 

The PMC has decided to seek help from the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) and fire brigade department for transportation of the body and sanitation of the vehicle after transportation. The PMC has reserved six out of 21 crematoriums in the city for cremation of Covid-19 casualties. "The PMC has made the arrangement to ensure the last rites are performed scientifically. The crematoriums have been assigned as per location of the hospitals," said Shrinivas Kandul, head of PMCâ€™s electrical department. 

He said the hospital, where the patient died, the local ward office, health department and fire brigade department have to coordinate for completion of the last rites. Kandul said the PMC will transport the body in a PMC ambulance. If these ambulances are not available, help from the PMPML, which has Pushpak ambulance, will be sought. The PMC officials said gas-based crematoriums will be reserved for coronavirus casualties.The crematoriums will be disinfected before and after the cremation. 

"Safety gear has been provided to those handling the bodies. He said instructions have been issued to doctors, nurses and other hospital staff about how to handle the bodies of the deceased," said a senior PMC official.
