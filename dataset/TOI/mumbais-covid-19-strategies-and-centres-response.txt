MUMBAI: Though hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak, civic officials have a reason to smile as they claim that some of their “innovative” mechanisms to control the virus may soon make it to national guidelines.


Mobile fever clinics, involving private sector doctors, focus on oxygen-supported beds as well as door-to-door survey of senior citizens are some of the measures that earned all-round praise from high-powered central officials at a virtual meeting held on Wednesday. Teams from the BMC and the state government participated in the meeting held by the Indian Council of Medical Research and Niti Aayog.

A BMC official said fever clinics held in congested slums attracted attention. 

“After the formation of the state task force under former KEM Hospital dean Dr Sanjay Oak, many decisions were taken that helped us reduce the death rate,” said the official. Private practitioners were involved in developing ways to reduce the city’s high death rate and spread. 

Soon after the first coronavirus cases were detected on March 11, BMC health staff started door-to-door visits in narrow slum pockets and semi-slum areas with thermal guns to check for fever.

The teams also started fever clinics with the help of local activists to convince slum-dwellers to visit them in case they had any Covid-19 symptoms such as fever or cough. “The BMC checked thousands of people at its fever clinics with the help of local doctors. This helped identify more positive cases as even symptomatic slum-dwellers were reluctant to visit civic hospitals,” said the official.

One of measures that caught ICMR’s attention was the house survey of seniors in slums. “We wanted to identify seniors with comorbidity and check their oxygen level using oximeters. Those with low oxygen levels were given medical attention even if they didn’t have symptoms,” he said.
