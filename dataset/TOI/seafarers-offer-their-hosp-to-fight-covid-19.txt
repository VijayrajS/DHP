Goa Seafarers offer their hospital to fight Covid-19
2020-03-31
MARGAO: The Goan Seafarers’ Association of India (GSAI) has written to the National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) to hand over the NUSI hospital at Chinchinim to the state government to be used as a quarantine facility. 


In a letter to NUSI general secretary Abdul Ghani Serang, GSAI pointed out that many Goan seafarers stranded on ships overseas are expected to be back in Goa soon, and thus if a quarantine facility is set up at the NUSI hospital, it could benefit the seafarers as well as public. 

“A lot of seafarers are stranded in different parts of the world and many are due to be signed off. As the government of Goa has also taken precautionary measures, this will be an additional help. It will be a great help for our community to be isolated in hospital with medical assistance rather than at home,” the letter stated.

GSAI president Frank Viegas told TOI that more than 3,000 Goan seafarers working on cruise lines whose jobs have been terminated or have been signed off following end of contract, who are waiting for repatriation to Goa. “A large number of beds will be required for quarantining these seamen. We urge the government of Goa to be prepared in this situation,” Viegas said.

Secretary Michael Beny Da Costa, in a statement, appealed to all the MLAs to urge the government to bring the stranded Goan seafarers back “as soon as possible before the situation goes out of hand.”
