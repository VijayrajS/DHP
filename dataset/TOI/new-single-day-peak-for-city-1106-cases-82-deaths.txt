Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia of the 82 deaths reported, 13 took place on May 27. “The remaining 69 deaths have taken place over a period of 34 days. These cases are being recorded now due to late reporting by various hospitals or due to incomplete submission of information,” Sisodia said.

The 69 deaths include 52 fatalities that had taken place at Safdarjung Hospital, a report for which was submitted by authorities a couple of days ago, he added. “The Delhi Death Audit Committee had looked into all these cases and given the figures.
