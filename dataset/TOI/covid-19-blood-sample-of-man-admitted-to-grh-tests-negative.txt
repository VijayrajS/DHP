MADURAI: The blood samples of the 35-year-old man admitted to the Covid-19 isolation ward at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) tested negative on Tuesday.


The man, who returned from Italy on February 29, got himself admitted to GRH on Monday after he developed symptoms of sore throat. The hospital authorities had earlier said that he didn’t have any symptoms of Covid-19. But, he was isolated as a precautionary measure. On Tuesday, GRH dean Dr J Sangumani confirmed that the man’s sample tested negative.

Meanwhile, Madurai district collector Dr T G Vinay inspected the Covid-19 isolation ward at the GRH and held discussions with the dean on the measures to be taken. Speaking to reporters, the district collector said that stringent measures are in place to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Madurai. “Lab to test Covid-19 samples is functioning in Theni. However, the facility will be made available in Madurai soon,” he said.

After reports of two more people from Dindigul district being admitted to GRH on suspicion of having symptoms of Covid-19 came out on Tuesday, the GRH dean clarified that it was not the case. “Doctors checked the two patients after there were suspicions. They were not even admitted to the isolation ward. They both have been discharged,” said Dr Sangumani.

Meanwhile, screening of passengers continued at Madurai airport. Starting a few days ago, after every international flight where passengers could have made contact, cleaning of the area is being done using proper chemical proportion of cleaning agents as a precautionary measure. Hand sanitizer gels are also being provided to arriving international passengers to clean their hands when stepping out of the airport. So far, more than 15,000 passengers have been screened for Covid-19 since January 28.
