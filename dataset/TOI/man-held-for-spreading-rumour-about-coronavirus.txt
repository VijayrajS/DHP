Dehradun: A man was arrested in Dehradun on Sunday for allegedly spreading rumours on COVID-19.

Prakhar Gupta, a resident of Kalidas Road in Dehradun, circulated a message on WhatsApp claiming that the daughter of a popular medical shop on Rajpur Road had returned from USA recently and is infected with CONVID-19.

The WhatsApp message also advised people to refrain from visiting the medical shop.

On the basis of the complaint, SSP Dehradun Arun Mohan Joshi formed a team, which found out that the message was originally sent by Prakhar Gupta, who has now been booked under section 151 of CrPC. 

"The daughter of the medical shop owner came back from USA on March 19 and has been quarantined at home since then. She is healthy and the information of her being infected with coronavirus is not true," police said.
