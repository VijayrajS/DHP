Lockdown effect: Registration department loses Rs 1,500 crore in a month
2020-04-25
VISAKHAPATNAM: The stamps and registrations department has lost around Rs. 1500 crore revenue in the past one month due to the lockdown.


In a year, the registrations department revenue would be between Rs 6000 cr to Rs 8000 cr. In the last 10 days of the financial year 2019-20 and the first month of the financial year 2020-21 has not yielded revenue, sources said.

The state has 291 sub-registrar offices in 38 registration districts in 13 revenue districts. The 12 registration zones are headed by a deputy inspector general (DIG)-rank officer.

Visakhapatnam district had logged 90% revenue (Rs 575 crore) against the target of Rs 634 crore in 2018-19. It logged only 72.67% (Rs 601 cr) out of its target Rs 827 crore in 2019-20, said Manmadha Rao, district registrar.

“We received no revenue in the last 10 days of March. We lost more than Rs 60 crore,” he said.

Sources said the department’s revenue would be Rs 17 crore to Rs 20 crore per month. The department’s income would be Rs 30 crore to Rs 50 crore in the last 10 days of the financial year as there would be more than 2,000 registration in the last two weeks of March.

The first month of April would generally get Rs 20 crore to Rs 25 crore. But the lockdown has upset the plans. Usually, there would be around 200 registrations in eight sub-registrar offices in the city limits every day.

After the government’s intent about making Vizag as executive capital, the revenue had gone up in the first two months of the New Year. Post-bifurcation, the revenue department had achieved 98% target in 2015-16.
