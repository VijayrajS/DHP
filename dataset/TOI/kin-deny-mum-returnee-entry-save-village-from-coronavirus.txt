Nagpur: One of the five Mumbai-returned labourers, tested Covid positive in Gadchiroli, had tried to sneak into the district and also reached his home in Mulchera on May 15, but his family ensured he was sent out of the village as part of the precaution the residents have been observing.

District collector Dipak Singla, commenting on the unexpectedly high awareness level among the Gadchiroli population, shared the information how the Mumbai-returned labourer was refused entry by his family members, who also informed the villagers.

“It was a surprise case for us as the family came forward to inform the rest of the villagers about the Mumbai-returned labourer, who worked with the civic body on contracts, having returned to stay at home against their wish,” said Singla.

“ Without allowing entry in village or home, the man was immediately asked to stay at an ashramshala which was readied as a quarantine centre. He was later shifted to Chamorshi’s institutional centre and tested,” said the collector.

“Full credit to the family members and villagers that they are practising caution to the extent of not allowing any outsider or even their kin to enter the villages without getting quarantined. They are informing the district administration, police or other authorities about anyone returning from the hotspots or other places. This awareness level is amazing,” he said.
