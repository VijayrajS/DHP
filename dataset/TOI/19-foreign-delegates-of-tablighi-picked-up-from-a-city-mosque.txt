BENGALURU: Ten Indonesians and nine Kyrgyzstan nationals who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat conference in February-March and were allegedly hiding in a mosque in Goripalya, off Mysuru Road, were picked up on Tuesday evening by officials involved in identifying contacts of Covid-19 patients. 

These 19 foreigners had visited the Tablighi Jamaat conference held at Nizamuddin, Delhi, which has been described as a cluster of Covid-19 cases.

The foreign nationals flew to the city from New Delhi on March 13, said a source familiar with the operation to track the Tablighi followers who attended the conclave and are suspected to have arrived in the city.

“We got the information from intelligence and other sources about 19 foreigners holed up in the mosque. We sent our health officers to inspect the place,” the source said. 

The three-floor mosque had housed the Indonesians on the first floor, the Kyrgyzstan nationals on the second floor and 12 Keralites on the third floor.

All the 31 people were residing in the mosque since March 16th and surviving only on bread. 

Health officials later spoke to the head cleric of the Masjid who later allowed them to enter the place and take all the 31 people to a public quarantine.

“We had feared we could land in a law and order situation given that it was a densely populated area. We entered the Masjid through the backdoor and ferried the 31people in two ambulances directly to a hospital in CV Raman Nagar,” added the source. 

“We were unable to converse with the foreigners because of the language barrier. They also tried to escape as they were worried about their safety. They also declined to eat the food we gave them and started shouting and beating us,” the source said. 

“We later managed to convince them and gave them bread and biscuits which they ate,” the source added.
