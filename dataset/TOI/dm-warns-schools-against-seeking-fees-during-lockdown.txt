KANPUR: Amid complaints lodged by parents that schools were demanding fees against the state government’s order, Kanpur Nagar DM Dr Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari on Thursday warned all private schools to comply with the notification.


He reminded the schools that the fees due will have to be charged after the end of the lockdown. The DM said if any school management sends notice for fee payment to parents during this period, legal action would be taken against them.

“The state government’s order does not imply that the pending fees to be charged after the lockdown was to be enhanced by schools. If any school is found enhancing the fees, it should be prepared to face legal consequences,” Tiwari added. 

“However, if the parents themselves feel capable of making the fee payment on time, they are welcome to do so,” he said. Tiwari emphasized on the fact that the fees was not waived, only the time period had been extended.

Meanwhile, BJP MLA Surendra Maithani wrote to CM Yogi Adityanath and urged him to waive the school fees of April, May and June as due to shutdown state, many parents would be unable to pay the fees. In a telephonic conversation with state education minister Dinesh Sharma, Maithani sought intervention of the state in it and also discussed the matter with Kanpur DM.
