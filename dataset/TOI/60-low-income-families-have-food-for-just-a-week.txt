AHMEDABAD: How has the extended lockdown impacted persons belonging to lower income groups? A rapid survey covering 110 household from April 10 to 22 by volunteers working with IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) reveal that about 76% of these household reported not earning regular income any more.

 The survey was a follow-up of an earlier survey in first phase of lockdown where 500 city-based household were surveyed on similar questions. The surveys were initiated by professor Ankur Sarin at IIM-A.




“Primary respondents in the survey are parents of the kids who are associated with IIM-A initiative of Prayas and also those who were associated with our earlier initiatives in different capacities,” said Sarin. “Aim of the survey was to assess the impact of lockdown and how the low-income families coped with the changing dynamics.”

Primarily, respondents were bus, van or auto drivers, daily wage workers, plumbers, rickshaw pullers and vegetable/ fruit vendors.

Many household in the survey also claimed to have reduced their daily food intake and reducing quantity of milk provided to the younger members of family. A few members mentioned that they were surviving on the khichdi from community kitchens.

The earlier survey had mentioned that about 4,500 workers from other states were found in four wards. Thus, the number could be much higher for the total 48 wards of the city. These workers were found taking shelter in which are small, informal workshops that also serve as their workspaces. Abandoned without income, they had also lost access to food as they relied on street vendors for cooked food.
