Faithful gear up for low-key Ramzan amid lockdown
2020-04-25
Coimbatore: Ramzan this year is markedly different than in the past. With an unprecedented ban on family gatherings and mass prayers due to Covid-19 pandemic, several Muslim families marked the beginning of the holy month of Ramzan on Friday with the sighting of the crescent moon. The month-long practice of fasting is considered a holy ritual by Muslims worldwide, accompanied with reflection and service to the community.“As it is our duty to extend support to the government in controlling the infection, we have decided not to open the mosques for public. People were informed to pray at their houses,” said A Faizal, joint secretary of Coimbatore district Sunnath Jamath Kolgai Kuttamaipu.Just like other days, calls for prayers would be announced from the mosques but instead of stepping out, people have been asked to pray at their homes itself, he said. The day-long fasting begins from Saturday. “In general, people would gather at mosques to see the crescent moon and then feed each other sweets to mark a happy beginning. But this year, we could neither visit the mosques nor sight the crescent with our friends and families,” rued M Abdul Hakkim, secretary of Jamaat e Islmai Hind.In the holy month of Ramdan, Muslims donate about 2.5% of their income to the poor. But Abdul Hakkim said they are uncertain how to go about fulfilling the ritual this year. Following the fasting that lasts from sunrise to sunset, Muslims invite their friends and families for iftaar. “But this year, it cannot be done in a grand manner,” he said. A Abdul Jabber, general secretary of Coimbatore District United Jamaat, said, “they are going to remember this Ramadan forever.”
