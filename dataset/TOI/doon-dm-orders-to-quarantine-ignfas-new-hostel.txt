2020-03-17
Dehradun: A day after a 26-year-old trainee forest service officer from Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA) was found Covid-19 positive, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava ordered that five blocks (A to E) of IGNFA’s new hostel be kept under quarantine for the next 14 days and the sixth block (F) be kept under isolation.

The DM has asked IGNFA director, Forest Research Institute’s director, and New Forest Hospital’s chief medical officer to carry out the order. DM’s order (a copy of which is with TOI) reads, “Doctors have suggested self-quarantine and Uttarakhand government has enacted Uttarakhand Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation 2020. Hence, some zones of IGNFA have been declared quarantine and isolation area.”

On Sunday, Uttarakhand had reported its first Covid-19 case with the probationer who returned from Spain testing positive for the virus. Now, it has come to light that some other trainee forest service officers who had gone on a study tour to Spain, Russia, and Finland didn’t report back to IGNFA.
