Don’t depute teachers for non-Covid work: CS to DMs
2020-06-06
Jaipur: Chief secretary D B Gupta has directed all the district collectors not to depute teachers in departments or in offices which are not related to Covid-19, on Friday.

The move came a day after education minister Govind Singh Dotasra shot a letter to the chief secretary, drawing his attention towards the practice of local district administrations engaging teachers at offices other than specified by the government.

He highlighted how teachers have been deputed to combat locust operations, entertaining people in quarantine centres, census of animals, stopping marriages or to ensure the number of guests should not exceed the limit and monitoring of MGNREGA work.

The order reads, “Teachers should not be posted in non-teaching offices other than those related to Covid-19.” Gupta further cleared that these orders should be followed strictly.

Dotasra had cancelled several such orders issued by its own district education officers on the directions of the district collectors in the last one month alone. In the letter to Gupta, Dotasra stated that such weird orders are creating resentment among the teachers’ community. “It is also affecting the regular work of teachers,” said Dotasra.
