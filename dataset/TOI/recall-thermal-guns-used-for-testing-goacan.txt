Recall thermal guns used for testing: Goacan
2020-05-02
Panaji: Goa Consumer Action Network (Goacan) has called for the immediate replacement of thermal guns (medical infrared thermometer) being used in various government departments as the product supplied is in violation of the packaged commodities rules (PCR).

Goacan has stated that after examining the box in which the thermometer is packed, they discovered that it has been manufactured in China and does not mention the mandatory importer’s name and address.

“This will compromise the health and safety of the consumer at a very crucial juncture of the battle against Covid-19 in Goa,” they said.

In a letter to the department of legal metrology’s controller, Prasad Shirodkar, Goacan has demanded that they book the supplier for offences committed under the packaged commodities rules. 

Goacan have requested to seize all undistributed medical infrared thermometers with the packaging, and recall all such devices with packaging from government and private offices. They have also sought that the authorities should contact the supplier to replace the existing numbers of the medical infrared thermometers with proper ones.
