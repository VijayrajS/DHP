Covid-19 scare? Ugadi spirit remains high in Hyderabad
2020-03-26
HYDERABAD: People did not let the lockdown dampen their festive spirit on Wednesday. Though celebrated low-key, most families in Hyderabad ushered in the Telugu New Year with Ugadi pachadi. 


Savouring the pachadi, which is a mix of six ingredients signifying life’s six emotions and phases, is a tradition on Ugadi day among Telugu families. “There can be no better reminder of the bitter-sweet journey of life than the Ugadi pachadi,” said Lalitha Kumari, a resident of Miyapur. 

Teaching her children how to make the recipe with raw mango, jaggery, tamarind, neem flowers, chilli and salt, she said the novel coronavirus pandemic has brought families together. “Since my children were not out playing, they helped me.” Residents, who were confined to their homes, watched the live telecast of Panchanga Sravanam and other rituals performed in Tirumala.

Endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy along with his family attended the state government’s Ugadi festivities held at the department’s offuce. Srinivas Bellam, a resident of Bhagyanagar Colony in Kukatpally, decorated his house with mango leaves, neem flowers and rangoli. “Ugadi signifies the beginning of Telugu New Year. This is a very auspicious day for Telugu people. I hope the gloom and fear of the virus is replaced with positivity and hope,” Srinivas, who is into facilities management, said. 

Ramana Eshwaragiri of Tellapur said though this has been a quiet Ugadi, it has taught people to be kind and considerate. “In the wake of the coronavirus situation, the New Year should bring a better understanding among people to follow rules and refrain from going outside in the fight against coronavirus,” he said.
