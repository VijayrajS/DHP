BENGALURU: Union minister D V Sadananda Gowda, who flew from Delhi to Bengaluru on Monday, courted controversy by not going into quarantine as mandated by the Karnataka government. He later said the stipulation does not apply to "those who hold certain responsible posts". 


 Karnataka school education minister S Suresh Kumar also said, "He is exempted (from quarantine) as a minister handling the ph arma sector." In an addendum to the SOP issued in the evening, the government clarified that Union and state ministers and officials on duty travelling across states are exempted from quarantine. 

 According to the Karnataka government's SOP, Delhi is among the six states and UTs with high incidence of Covid-19 and travellers from these places have to mandatorily remain in institutional quarantine for at least 7 days. 

 Soon after arriving, Gowda was seen being escorted out of the airport terminal and led to a private car that sped away. Later, the minister told a news agency, "The guidelines on quarantine are applicable to all citizens but there are certain exemption clauses, for those who hold certain responsible posts."
