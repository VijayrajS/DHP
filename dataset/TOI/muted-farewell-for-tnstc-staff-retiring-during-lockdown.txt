Muted farewell for TNSTC staff retiring during lockdown
2020-05-02
Trichy: Around 45 TNSTC employees in various ranks including conductors and ticket checkers have retired from Trichy region comprising 13 depots in Trichy, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts on April 30. As the retiring employees could not reach their depots owing to the lockdown, branch managers delivered a cheque to pay a portion of retirement benefits and a sandalwood garland at the doorstep of retiring staff. This is a shift from the routine in TNSTC history as the send-off party means a lot for the transport employees. The employees who are about to retire prepare for the D-day a month in advance as invitations for the send-off party would be prepared by then. “TNSTC employees retiring from the service value the feedback they get from their colleagues on retirement day. Since their family members will be present, the one final day is precious for us as we share interesting moments in our service,” a senior official with TNSTC Trichy region said. Though the retiring employees understand the current situation and acknowledge the need to suspend celebrations, the lockdown has indeed made them feel unlucky. “After retiring from the service, our colleagues will drop us home. It is a proud moment as we toiled for more than 30 years. Whoever retired during the lockdown will feel bad for missing out such moments,” said, P Gunasekar, a ticket checker who retired on April 30. The TNSTC depot buildings that look lifeless now would have otherwise been in a celebratory mood with music bands welcoming hundreds of guests for the retiring TNSTC employees. The situation is no different for other government employees who retired from their services on April 30.
