Despite guarding red zones, cops fight Covid
2020-04-28
Vadodara: Even though they have been on their toes round-the-clock guarding the hottest red zone in the city, Nagarwada, not a single cop has tested positive for coronavirus in the city so far.

Senior police officials said that they are taking utmost care to ensure that none of the policeman gets infected with Covid. “Strict instructions have been given to the cops not to have any food or beverage from locals in any area. This will reduce their contact with plausible infection. We have been sending in food packets and water at every point in sufficient quantity,” said Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner. 

The move came after many cops in Ahmedabad reported Covid positive after they reportedly consumed beverages offered by the locals in some areas. “We are providing sanitizers to every cop out there in the field and everyone has been strictly instructed to wear masks. Also, sanitizer showers are installed at some spots,” Gahlaut told TOI. 

The police department has been conducting routine health check-up of cops posted in red zone as well as other areas. The cops who seem fatigued are asked to rest at home. “If any policeman complains of fever or cold, he or she is examined immediately and given medicines. So far, not a single cop has tested positive for coronavirus,” Gahlaut added. 

Along with the cops, a company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Border Security Force (BSF) too has been deployed in the city for ensuring that citizens follow the lockdown.
