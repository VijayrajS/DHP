Waste generated by families in home quarantine not segregated
2020-05-17
Dehradun: The disposal of masks and gloves used by people in home quarantine, labeled as “domestic hazardous waste” by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is not being handled with proper care in Uttarakhand. 

A total of 49,000 people are in home quarantine in the state, 4,500 of them in Dehradun, of whom six have tested positive for the coronavirus. While the health department is segregating and safely disposing of biomedical waste generated from quarantine centres and hospitals and the civic body is taking care of hazardous waste generated in containment zones, the disposables discarded by those in home quarantine elsewhere is getting mixed with other waste, increasing the risk of Covid-19 spread. 

A total of 3,531 persons are in self-isolation in Haridwar, the state’s only remaining red zone. In Chamoli, 6,515 people are in home quarantine, 5,276 in Tehri, 7,210 in Udham Singh Nagar and 4,460 in Pauri. As per CPCB, local authorities must maintain a list of homes where people are in self-quarantine and hazardous waste must be collected from these doorsteps in separate bags. Such waste should only be handled by trained workers equipped with protective gear. “My neighbour is in home quarantine. The practice of mixing all kinds of waste poses a great risk,” said Umesh Karanwal, a resident of Old Survey Road.

Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based research organization ‘Social Development for Communities” (SDC), believes that the issue of collection and disposal of “hazardous waste” generated by people in quarantine is being taken lightly.

“We have come to know that in the hills, there is no concrete policy for waste collection from those serving home quarantine. I would request the government to formulate a strict policy for the management of such waste, as it can trigger spread of the infection,” he said. While director general (health) Dr Amita Upreti couldn’t be contacted by TOI,despite repeated attempts, a senior health department official, who did not wish to be named, said that the department is ensuring proper disposal of biomedical waste from quarantine facilities and hospitals. “We have already shared guidelines of waste management with the Nagar Nigam. The civic body has to ensure the disposal of waste generated by people in home quarantine,” he said.

Kailash Joshi, chief municipal health officer, on the other hand said that the health department should be collecting hazardous waste from homes where people are in quarantine, as there was no way for the civic body to identify such homes. “In containment zones, we give protective gears to our workers and make sure to separately collect masks and gloves used by people who might be infected. We sanitize such waste and expose them in the sun for sterilization. However, it is impossible to identify the homes where people are in quarantine in the rest of the city. With limited manpower, it is not feasible for us to collect masks and gloves separately,” said Joshi. He added that those in home quarantine must themselves collect hazardous waste in separate bags before handing it over to sanitation workers, so they can handle it with proper care.

Yugal Kishore Pant, additional secretary health, said, “The families can also leave such waste at nearby hospitals, from where it will go to medical waste management plants. Otherwise, they can separate the waste and alert sanitation workers while handing it over,” he added.
