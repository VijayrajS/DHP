AURANGABAD: Fourteen staffers, including two officers, of Harsul Central Jail have tested positive for Covid-19, raising fresh questions as only recently 29 inmates had tested positive for the contagion despite the premises being under lockdown.

Jail superintendent Jail Hiralal Jadhav on Wednesday said swab samples of 60 officers and staff members, including himself, were taken on Tuesday and the reports arrived on Wednesday.

“All jail staff members who tested positive are asymptomatic and have been quarantined at the jail’s rest house and in two bungalows on the jail premises,” the superintendent told TOI.

The officer said all the patients are being attended to by a Covid-19 task force as well as medical officers from the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation. 

Jadhav said the lockdown, which was in force at the jail premises since April 19, was lifted today (Wednesday).

Meanwhile, the district administration said that 121 more people, including 41 women, tested positive in the last 24 hours till Wednesday, taking the total count to 2,271. 

However, 1,283 have been treated and discharged while 872 are being treated at different facilities in the district, said officials.

The case are being reported from newer areas, including the ones situated close to the the industrial estates in the city. The number of cases being reported from rural areas is low, as only two cases were reported from Savarkheda in Soegaon on Wednesday and another from Kannad.
