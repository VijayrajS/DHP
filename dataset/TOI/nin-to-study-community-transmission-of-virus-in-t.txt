NIN to study community transmission of virus in Telangana
2020-05-16
HYDERABAD: With migrants returning home testing positive for coronavirus, the talk of community transmission of the virus has gained credence of late. To study community tranmission and to determine the spread of the virus, Hyderabad-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) will soon launch a community-based serosurveillance in Telangana.


Serosurvellance is monitoring of the presence or absence of specific substances in the blood serum of a population. As a majority of people affected by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) do not exhibit any symptoms of Covid-19 pandemic, serosurveillance will help in finding active cases and contact tracing, NIN scientists said. It will also help in understanding the extent of spread of infection in the given population and strengthening public health mitigation measures.

According to R Hemalatha, director of NIN, Jangaon, Kamareddy and Nalgonda districts will be covered under serosurveillance. The NIN director said population-based seroepidemiological studies will help in determining the burden of Covid-19 infection at the community level and monitoring the trends in transmission of the infection. “The study findings will be useful in designing and implementing appropriate containment measures,” she said. In each district, 10 villages will be selected randomly. From each village, 40 persons above 18 years will be covered.

The main objective of the serosurveillance are to estimate and monitor the trend of sero-prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population.

NIN and the government has already initiated a house-to-house survey in 30 villages across three districts.
