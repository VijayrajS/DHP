Covid-19: 128 prisoners, senior jail official test positive in Jaipur
2020-05-17
JAIPUR: A total of 128 prisoners at the Jaipur district jail have tested positive for Covid-19 in two days, accounting for almost 40 per cent of the 332 new cases reported in Rajasthan since Friday. Migrant workers who have returned to their native places comprise the second largest cluster of infections confirmed in the past 48 hours.



While 24 of the inmates have been admitted to SMS Hospital because of age or co-morbidities, the rest are being monitored at a treatment facility set up on the jail premises. A senior jail official who tested positive on Saturday has been hospitalised, too.

Much to the relief of health officials, none of the samples collected from the larger Jaipur central jail next door, which has 1,172 inmates, came out positive for the virus.

“When the first case was reported in the district jail on May 11, we started mass screening and testing of all staff and inmates. With a treatment centre on the jail premises itself, we are hopeful of containing further spread of the virus,” said chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I) Narottam Sharma, who has been camping at the prison with his team for two days now.

The district jail currently houses 423 prisoners, of whom a few are recent entrants. One of the first two inmates to test positive for Covid-19 is from Jamwarangarh in Jaipur district and had been brought to the jail on April 13.

The other inmate to test positive along with him had been arrested by Bajaj Nagar police on May 9 and put in a cell with 18 other prisoners on May 10. He was diagnosed with Covid-19 the very next day. 

Of the 18 who had shared the cell with him, two have tested positive.
