Vadodara’s prominent hospital in dock over Covid-19 cases
2020-05-17
VADODARA: A fact-finding committee has been formed by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to look into the affairs at city’s prominent Bhailal Amin General Hospital (BAGH) after around 15 Covid-19 positive cases were linked directly or indirectly to the hospital.

The string of cases linked to the hospital started with a doctor there testing positive. Following this his wife who is a gynaecologist, an intern doctor, nurses and other persons working at the hospital tested positive. Persons deployed by an agency at the hospital also started testing positive.

Besides this, patients who had been treated at the hospital also got infected, leading to panic. BAGH is the first multi-speciality hospital in the city that also offered super-specialty treatment and is preferred by many in the city. The immediate reason for ordering the probe was that four persons who had tested positive for Covid-19 since Friday night were linked to the hospital by the VMC. Sources said that these included husbands of two women patients treated at the hospital and two persons who had worked at the hospital.

One of the males who tested positive since Friday night is also a bank employee and this has complicated matters further. Similarly, the agency that provided manpower to BAGH for housekeeping and food is also working at other places including a company selling vegetables, grocery and similar essentials online.

Despite a series of deaths over a period of time, these are yet to be put on record by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). Sources said that these included deaths that took place even this week.
