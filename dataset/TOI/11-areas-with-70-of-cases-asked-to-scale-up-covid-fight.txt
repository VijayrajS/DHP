NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday asked the 11 municipal areas accounting for 70% of active Covid-19 cases to step up testing for early detection, timely clinical management and a reduction in fatality rate. 


 The 11 areas with high case-load are in seven states - Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. 

 In a review meeting with senior authorities of these areas, the health ministry asked them to be mindful of ramping up health infrastructure to ensure preparedness for the next two months and maintain high vigilance in old cities, urban slums and other high density pockets. 

 "It was told that the major challenge lies in those corporations having shorter doubling time, higher mortality rate and a higher confirmation rate than the national average," the health ministry said in a statement after the meeting. 

 The areas were briefed about the factors to be considered while mapping containment and buffer zones; activities mandated in containment zone, active search for cases through house-to-house surveillance, contact tracing, testing protocol, clinical management of active cases, etc, the ministry said.
