2020-04-07
DEHRADUN: The state health department on Monday decided to organise regular psychiatric session for people living in sealed areas or are under institutional quarantine since weeks. The move comes after the Centre issued guidelines on March 28 to form a helpline to address psychological concerns of people in quarantine. National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) would anchor the helpline and provide psychological help to the people placed in self quarantine or in the hospitals.

The Uttarakhand health department on Monday got out a list of eight doctors who would provide psychological counseling to people in quarantine in Dehradun.

The doctors will be visiting the areas suggested by the district administration and will have to submit a detailed report of session to the health department on the same day.

A health department official said, “Stress, fear, lonliness, uncertainty and other psychological disorders are very normal in today’s time as we have deviated a lot from our daily routine. Keeping this in mind, Centre announced to provide counseling.” He added that not just people in quarantine but special counseling would also be provided to farmers and daily wagers who have lost their source of income and are under a lot of stress.
