Lockdown poses problem for pet owners in city
2020-03-27
Pune: The coronavirus lockdown has posed a problem for those who have pets at home.

Many people said that they were unable to take their dogs out for walks or defecation, while others said finding food, essentials and veterinarian services was a huge problem.

The situation has remained unchanged despite the exemption granted to veterinarians and pet stores by the Union home ministry through a notification.

Purva Sankhla, a resident of Satara Road, said, “There is certainly a problem with regards to supply of dog essentials in the market. Pet stores in our area are closed. I even checked online, but e-commerce sites are only supplying essential commodities, which do not include dog food.”

Lyla Cama, an NIBM Road resident and a dog trainer, said, “Finding dog food has become a major challenge. All the pet stores in my area are closed and deliveries are not taking place. Delivery boys from a pet store in Aundh were beaten up by the police. I will have to drive all the way to Aundh on Friday to get food for my dog. I am planning to pick up over 15kg of dog food as many people from my area have been calling me for the same.”

Shilpi Hisariya Khemka, owner of a pet shop Hadapsar, said people indulged in bulk buying when the 21-day lockdown was announced. “We are selling whatever stock we have in hand, but new supplies are not coming in. My customers call me in advance, and I give them the time when they can visit to make purchases. I open the store for only 30-45 minutes daily,” she said.

Prathamesh Gaikar, another pet shop owner in Baner, said that he has been getting orders for at least 30 deliveries daily as many shops are shut. My shop has run out of stuff, but I am getting stock picked up from warehouses. Some dog food brands have depots in Pune but are facing difficulty with logistics. While stock is available for one to two months in Pune, it is not reaching shops and customers due to staff crunch and other logistical issues,” he said.

He further added that he is delivering only pet food and some essentials like medicated shampoos. “We have told people that we will not deliver toys and treats as these are not essentials. We are also urging people to buy food that will last for a month. If people start hoarding, no stock will be left in the city,” he added.

Pet shop owners stated that maximum demand for pet food is from people who feed stray dogs and animals. Cama said, “Restaurants, shops and all other establishments are shut, and strays are not getting food and water. Dog food brands have provided stock to organisations to feed strays, but people are not allowed to get out. Something needs to be done to ensure that even stray animals are fed well.”

Pet care during lockdown

- If society is big, walk dogs only on society premises. If outdoors, walk only a short distance so that dogs can pee or poop

- Make sure to clean the poop

- Clean paws of dogs with a sanitizer after walks

- Do not visit pet shops or veterinarians unless there is an emergency

- If dogs can’t be taken outdoors, find games to play with them indoors

- Play sniffing and mentally demanding games with dogs - 15 minutes of cognitive or sniffing activity is equivalent to an hour of physical activity
