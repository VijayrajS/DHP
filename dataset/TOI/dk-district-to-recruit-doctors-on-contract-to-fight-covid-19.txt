2020-04-24
Mangaluru: The Dakshina Kannada health department will appoint more doctors and paramedics at the Wenlock Hospital, the designated Covid-19 hospital in the district.

As the district continues to grapple with Covid-19, the health department has decided to appoint specialists, nurses, lab technicians and other staff on a temporary basis to deal with the crisis. They will serve exclusively at the Covid Hospital for the next six months. 

District Health and Family Welfare Officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy said additional staff will be appointed directly. “A walk-in interview will be held at the office of district health and family welfare department on April 28. We will appoint eight specialists (Rs 60,000 per month), 14 nurses (Rs 20,000), five lab technicians (Rs 15,000) and nine Group D employees (Rs 12,000). More staff required for the Covid Hospital in the wake of increase in the number of cases,” Dr Bairy said.

With one death and 12 recoveries, the district has four active Covid-19 currently.

Supervised isolation centre

Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh on Thursday declared the First Neuro Hospital located at Padil in Kannur village in the city outskirts as an active containment zone after P-432, a 78-year-old female patient from Bantwal, was reported to have undergone treatment there. She was tested positive for Covid-19 later and is undergoing treatment at Wenlock District Hospital.

Restrictions have also been imposed on buffer zone of an additional 5-km radius, she said.

For effective implementation of Covid-19 control measures, tahsildar and taluk magistrate of Mangaluru taluk have been appointed as incident commander, who will be overall in-charge of containment zone.

In another official memorandum, the DC has also declared First Neuro Hospital as a supervised isolation centre for the district.
