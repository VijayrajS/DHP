Covid-19 fears force SAI to shut its south centre
2020-03-11
BENGALURU: The Sports Authority of India, South Centre locked down its facility as a precaution after the city recorded four coronavirus cases in two days.


With the men's and women's hockey teams- which have qualified for the Tokyo Olympics- training at the facility, SAI said it did not want to take any chance with their health and well-being.

"We were compelled to do it. The cream of Indian sport is training in our facility. From the senior hockey teams, race walkers to para athletes who have made the Tokyo grade. We have national campers in athletics (middle and long distance), volleyball, weightlifting besides the junior men and women's hockey teams, numbering around 180. We cannot afford to take things easy," SAI senior director Captain Ajay Kumar Bahl (Indian Navy) told TOI.

Athletes and others at the centre have been asked to desist from handshakes and hugs. All requirements of the national campers and support staff are being met inhouse. They have been advised against leaving the campus, attend public or private functions or train with non-campers. Movies in theatres, eating out or ordering food through online platforms have been banned.

Come & Play scheme on hold

With the stakes being high during the Olympic year, the restrictions are likely to be in place well after the threat recedes and will be lifted only after a thorough evaluation of the situation or an advisory from the central government.

Top SAI officials in the city, who went into a huddle on Monday, decided that the first big casualty of the lockdown would be the popular Come & Play scheme which encouraged civilians to use the training facilities at its centre.

"We have around 100 people in the scheme who come to SAI mainly for football, athletics and swimming. They were told this morning that their entry has been temporarily banned," Bahl said.
