2020-04-10
PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Dehu Road police will implement a complete lockdown within its limits on Friday and Saturday. 


The residents would have to take prior permission from the police to go out for purchasing essential goods or other emergencies. “A Covid-19 positive case was reported at Chikhali in Pimpri Chinchwad recently. The area borders Dehu Road. Keeping this in mind and also the recent spurt in Covid-19 cases elsewhere, a meeting was held on Wednesday and the decision on the two-day lockdown was taken,” senior inspector Manish Kalyankar of the Dehu Road police told TOI.

The officer said the shops selling essential goods would remain open, but people would have to take prior permission over call before heading out. “Four drones will be deployed to keep a check on lockdown violators. Teams will be deployed at all important chowks to stop non-essential movement,” Kalyankar added.
