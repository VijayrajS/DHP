Maharashtra most vulnerable for coronavirus
2020-05-03
it is a matter of concern that in each and every part of India the pandemic coronavirus is more or less easing but on the opposite side in Maharashtra on daily basis the Corona virus cases are increasing as well as number of deaths are also mounting enormously.it is not a matter of shallow concern but a matter of deep concern, and the government is more active to save their piwer than to take care of coronavirus pandemic in the state.The tough rules and instances are required by the police and the controlling agencies as in UP because the results in UP are very welcoming..The willpower of Maharashtra government irrespective of naming anyone I would like to suggest that in the state governance stricter actions to control this pandemic must be taken immediately otherwise the next New York will not be so far for Maharashtra and especially Mumbai at least.
