HYDERABAD: The excise department’s crackdown during the lockdown period has led to registering of 675 cases for stocking up and selling liquor. All these people were not licensed liquor shop owners but individuals who stored and sold liquor during this period. Cases were also booked against 16 liquor shop owners.


Excise minister V Srinivas Goud has directed the officials to keep an eye on those trying to transport or serve liquor to people and make moolah during this period. He said licences of shops would be annulled if owners were caught aiding the culprits. 

“Action will also be taken against officials for failing to take immediate action on the culprits,” the minister said.

Of the 675 cases, 235 cases were booked in Khammam district alone, which shares a border with Chhattisgarh. In GHMC area, 65 cases were booked, officials said. Officials also booked a case against two persons for selling liquor to a group of labourers, a video of which has gone viral. 

Excise officials said cases of those who had complained of withdrawal symptoms in hospitals had reduced. Though there were several cases reported earlier in the state , the numbers have seen a substantial fall. “In the beginning, several cases had to be dealt with. Now, two or three cases are being reported,” an official said.
