Pet owners struggle to find food, vets amid lockdown in Andhra Pradesh
2020-04-27
VISAKHAPATNAM: Voona Kartikeya, owner of an eight-year-old dog with a medical condition, has been running from pillar to post to get vet-prescribed food. For many pet owners like Kartikeya in Visakhapatnam, the lockdown has posed a different set of problems. They are unable to take them out for walks, find dog and cat food or veterinarian service. This despite the central and state governements including pet food in essential commodities.


Usha Rani, owner of a pug, is worried about her dog’s survival. “My dog hasn’t eaten for the past few days as his wet food used to be delivered everyday and it is not available now,” she said. “All pet stores in my area are closed and deliveries have been suspended,” she added. 

A few other owners, such as Renuka of MVP Colony, are having problems with walking their dogs. While the government has not announced anything particular about walking dogs outside, it is not encouraged given the lockdown. So while some have started to take their dogs out at dawn, others have limited themselves to terrace or car parks.

But a few vets and pet shop owners, who are available, are braving the lockdown and helping pet owners. 

Speaking to TOI, Nihar Tripathi, owner of Om Sai Pet Nest shop in Muralinagar, said “Usually we used to visit four to five houses, in urgent cases, to supply food and medicine. Now the number has shot up to 15-18. We are also offering home services for grooming during the lockdown”.

“I attend to four to five cases, strictly on appointment basis, regularly. Especially if they are related to tick-borne fevers, diarrhoea, skin allergies, ear and eye infections through I/V fluids, antibiotics, allergies and emergency surgeries,” said Dr N Sridhar, owner of Paws N Tails pet clinic.”
