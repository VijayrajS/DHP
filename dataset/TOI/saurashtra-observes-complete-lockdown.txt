2020-03-26
Rajkot: The 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday was almost complete in Saurashtra’s commercial capital as well as other cities of Saurashtra.

All the major roads were deserted with people adhering to Modi’s ‘stay at home’ call. 

However, six FIRs were lodged in the city and 22 in the rural areas for the violation of the public notification regarding prohibitory orders. 

According to police, most of the FIRs lodged were related to shops of non-essential commodities that remained open despite the lockdown . Police had operated several auto rickshaws in the residential area announcing that people were prohibited from venturing outside of the house. 

All the major markets too observed a complete shutdown in the city. The shops selling essential commodities remained open for few hours of morning and evening which resulted in crowds at many places. The shop owners are not allowing more people to enter and people have to wait in queue outside. Police also made circles on the road outside some of the shops asking customers to maintaining adequate distance.
