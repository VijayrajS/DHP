When to go home from quarantine?
2020-06-03
Bhopal: Thirty-year-old Sameer (name changed) has completed his 14-day quarantine in a public school and, like many others, has not been informed as to when he would be ‘discharged’. The confusion is adding to more apprehensions in the community over the treatment and care of ‘suspected Covid-19’ patients. Sameer and his family members have twice tested negative for Covid-19.

“I have not been informed when the quarantine would end. As per initial communication with officials, it was to be a 14-day period. It has been over 15 days and there is no indication when I can return home to Jehangirabad. Staying in the school poses more risk,” said Sameer. Eight members of his family are quarantined in a school in Bhopal. “If we complain, there might be repercussions,” he said. 

Several countries have changed the criteria for discharge from test-based strategy to symptom-based or ‘time based strategy. A review of the ICMR laboratory surveillance data also indicated that after initial RT-PCR positive results, patients became negative after a median duration of 10 days. Recent studies have also suggested that the viral load peaks in the pre-symptomatic period (two days before symptoms) and goes down over the next seven days, according to ICMR guidelines.

Health experts explain that available evidence does not indicate any increase in the risk of transmission from patients discharged based on the revised discharge criteria. 

The revised criterion also specifies that such patient will be advised to isolate himself/herself at home and self-monitor his/her health for further seven days.

In this scenario, not many have been allowed to ‘home-isolate’ in densely populated areas of the state capital.
