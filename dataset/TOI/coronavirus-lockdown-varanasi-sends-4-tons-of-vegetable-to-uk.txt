2020-04-23
VARANASI: Amid the coronavirus lockdown, a good news made its way from the agricultural sector of Varanasi region as for the first time, a consignment of four tons of green vegetables including chilli, cucumber and lauki (gourd) left for Delhi to be exported to the UK, which is reeling under the onslaught of the virus.

Earlier, vegetable consignments were sent only to the Gulf countries from Varansi region. Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “On Tuesday, a truck left with four tons of farm fresh green chilli, gourd and cucumber in air-conditioned containers for Delhi. The vegetables grown by a progressive farmer, Anil Kumar Rai, in his fields in Ghazipur, will reach London by air cargo on Thursday from the Delhi airport.” “It is a welcome development for the Varanasi region as the dispatch to London will generate opportunities in the European market also,” he added. 

Given the potential of production of fruits and vegetables in Varanasi region which includes five districts of Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Chandauli of Varanasi division and neighbouring Mirzapur and Bhadohi, APEDA has begun the process of setting up agri-export hubs in the region.
