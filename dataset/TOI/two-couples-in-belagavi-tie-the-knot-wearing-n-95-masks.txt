In Yaxamba in Chikkodi taluk, two couple that entered into matrimony on Friday, wore masks during the rituals and flashed banners, which contained messages to maintain cleanliness and take necessary precautions to tackle the disease. The two couples – Preeti and Shekar, Mallappa and Deepali – were provided sufficient assistance by the district health department in this endeavour. In addition to wearing N95 masks throughout the ceremony, the families of the brides and grooms had also arranged for talks on the disease, wherein the visitors were told about the need to wash their hands and maintain hygiene.

Preeti’s father Arun Kamte said that a wedding offered a unique opportunity to reach a large cross-section of the demographic. “Also, it is our duty to extend our support to the government in such an hour of crisis,” he said.

Chikkodi taluk health officer VV Shinde was appreciative of the couples’ initiative. “We felt very pleased when the parents approached us to discuss the possibility of using the weddings as an event to raise awareness. Many people have been educated in this manner,” Shinde told TOI.
