MUMBAI: Former wrestler Chokhaji Avhad has lived up to the sobriquet of 'Khandesh ki Bijli'. The 90-year-old won the toughest fight of his life against Covid-19 and returned home recently. "I have won the battle against Covid-19 and I'm returning home," the nonagenarian declared on being discharged from the railway hospital at Bhusaval, his home town, on June 4. 

Avhad, who was a railway employee, tested positive on May 21 and was admitted to the Railway hospital the same day. His 81-year-old wife wife, who was hospitalised after testing positive, has recovered too. However, their 56-year-old daughter, who contracted the virus, succumbed. Both Avhad and his wife were admitted to the ICU, but did not require oxygen or ventilator support. The other members of their family of seven were home quarantined as they tested negative.

His son Navin says his father showed tremendous courage. "We were shaken, but he lifted our morale saying nothing would happen to him. He got himself admitted to the Bhusawal Division Railway Hospital." Navin says his father's healthy and disciplined lifestyle, which includes an exercise regimen along with an hour of meditation, as well as the care and attention provided by the doctors and nurses helped him beat the virus. 

Avhad started his career in the Central Railway as assistant driver on steam engines. He went on to work on all types of locomotives, including diesel and electric engines, and retired 31 years ago on May 31, 1989. During his stint in the railways, he bagged several awards for meritorious service. However, wrestling has remained a lifelong passion and Avhad has participated in competitions at the state level. Navin says he used to be called 'Khandesh ki Bijli' for his prowess in the mud akhadas.
