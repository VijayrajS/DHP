Govt’s 104 helpline a bulwark in virus fight
2020-03-25
Bhubaneswar: The state government’s 104 helpline number has become a major shield to stop spreading of novel coronavirus in the state. It is not only registering names of the persons returning from Covid-19-affected countries, but is giving medical advice during their quarantine or isolation period. 

According to state government’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19 Subroto Bagchi, 104 is like a moat around a fort. “It helps us fight against the spread of coronavirus,” he had told mediapersons while discussing about the helpline two days ago. This helpline, launched in 2015, has been receiving around 500 calls per day, but now the call centre is getting more than 7,000 calls a day. It may increase further. 

Works secretary Krishan Kumar, who is overseeing the helpline, said, “The 104 helpline number is helpful in storing database of people returning from Covid-19-affected countries. There were around 45 people in the call centre, but now we have strengthened the centre by engaging 150 people.” 

As many people ask for doctor consultation, the government has created a team of doctors, led by retired director of health Saroj Nayak. To assist him, 14 doctors have been deployed in the centre to provide consultation over phone to people under home quarantine or isolation. The doctor team and 150 members of call centre sit at Smart City office. The government has also set up an outbound call centre to act on the information received through the 104 helpline. It has been set up at Odisha Computer Application Centre (OCAC). 

“Main purpose of the centre is to call the people in quarantine or home isolation twice a day and take feedback from them. More than 150 persons are handling the calls and seven doctors, including senior professor Braja Das, are giving medical advice to the people, an official said.

If any person wants to talk to a doctor about symptoms or anything related to Covid-19, the professionals at the centre forward the call to a doctor. They also suggest the people, who return to Odisha from other states, to talk to the local administration and report if they find any symptoms of infection. 

The number of calls made to 104 helpline from 7am on Monday to 7am on Tuesday was 11,187. A total 3,816 persons returned from abroad have registered with the state government through the 104 helpline and ‘covid19.odisha.gov.in’ portal by 7am on Tuesday.

Besides, people can report to state control room (0674-2390466) or to state surveillance officer (9439994857, 9439994859). The government agencies, including Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC), have issued helpline number 1929 to address issues faced by residents during the lockdown period, but nobody picked up call in this number on Monday. This correspondent called this number eight times between 10.25am and 4.19pm on Monday. The response was either “Sorry, the network is congested’, or “Sorry, there is no reply from the number you have called”.

BMC deputy commissioner (sanitation) Subhendu Sahu had said, “The problem happens when many users call at a time. A caller should try more than once to get connected.” The number was found working on Tuesday.
