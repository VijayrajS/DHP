Covid-19 fugitives from Indore nabbed 700km away in Morena
2020-04-17
BHOPAL/INDORE: Two Covid-19 patients, who had broken out of quarantine in Indore on Wednesday, were arrested nearly 700km away on the Morena border on Thursday night. A third corona patient is still at large.


Officials fear the duo may have infected several others along the way. They and two other fugitives were immediately quarantined in a Morena hospital.

Police believe eight persons quarantined near Choithram Hospital in Indore started planning their breakout after five of them were told at 10am on Wednesday that they had tested positive for Covid-19. They jumped the wall and made off. The escape was noticed when health officials went for a second round of screening.

Three of the fugitives were caught on Wednesday evening, but five others – including three Covid-19 patients – were untraced. Police knew that four of them were from Rampur district of UP, so they started checking all routes that lead across the border. “They changed four trucks to reach Morena,” said an officer.
