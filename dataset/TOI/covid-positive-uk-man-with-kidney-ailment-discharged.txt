Patel had come to the city from Mumbai on March 18 to undergo ayurvedic treatment for kidney-related ailments and through yoga. While he was undergoing the ayurvedic therapy, he started suffering from high-grade fever after which he was taken to the Gotri hospital on March 26.

An RO plant and a water pipeline was also laid to ensure that the patient can undergo dialysis uninterruptedly.

The city so far has recorded 12 cases, of which two have died, six have recovered and four are under treatment now.
