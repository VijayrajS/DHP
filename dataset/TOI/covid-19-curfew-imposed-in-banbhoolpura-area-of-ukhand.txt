Dehradun: A day after thousands of residents of Banbhoolpura in Haldwani area of Nainital district came out in the streets to protest, the state government on Monday decided to impose curfew in the area.

With this, Banbhoolpura became the first location in the state, where curfew has been imposed in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Earlier, seven localities across Uttarakhand had been sealed after cases of novel coronavirus were registered there.

Terming the incident in Banbhoolpura area on Sunday — when despite the lockdown, a large number of people came out on the streets following spread of a rumour — as “unfortunate,” CM Trivendra Singh Rawat said, “We had to take a tough stand that such acts will not be tolerated at a time when the entire state and country is united in the efforts to fight Covid-19. That is why,curfew has been imposed at Banbhoolpura.” 

The CM pointed out that presently around 2,500 tourists, including 1,300 foreigners were in Uttarakhand due to the lockdown. “We are taking proper care of them and they are not facing any problem. Of the 1,200 domestic tourists, the maximum of 175 are from West Bengal. We also have tourists from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states. They are facing no problem and are safe here,” he added. 

On the issue of relaxation and opening of some offices during the lockdown period, the CM said, “The state is awaiting the guidelines from the Centre, which will arrive latest by Tuesday. Earlier, the focus was on saving lives but now the focus will also be on the economy. We will need to take care of both.”
