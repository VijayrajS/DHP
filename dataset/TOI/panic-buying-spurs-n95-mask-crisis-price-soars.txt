Coronavirus in Lucknow: Panic buying spurs N95 mask crisis, price soars
2020-03-06
LUCKNOW: Panic buying of N95 respirators in the city amid a global coronavirus outbreak has triggered a crisis of these special masks that block tiny airborne particles and offer fair protection against disease-causing microbes.


A TOI reality check in Hazratganj, Gomtinagar, Kaiserbagh, Bhoothnath, Chowk, Niralanagar and Lalbagh on Thursday revealed hand sanitisers are flying off shelves as quickly as the masks. Home hoarding and eroding supply at wholesale markets are encouraging price-gouging by those who still have masks and sanitisers in stock.

Medical stores in Indiranagar conceded that they had run out of N95 respirators, which are sold for Rs 200 to Rs 500, while hand sanitisers were in short supply. “We turned back 50 customers today,” said Sanjay, who owns a store.

The situation in Gomtinagar was no different. Crisis of masks and sanitisers has prompted wholesalers to jack up prices, complained retailers. “There has been massive overnight sales, leading to the crunch. Prices of N95 masks range from Rs 150 to Rs 300,” said the owner of a pharmacy near RML hospital.

A pharmacy proprietor in Patrakarpuram observed lack of public awareness had triggered the panic buying. The N95 mask is designed to block at least 95% of 0.3 micron test particles. 

Pharmacies told TOI that raw materials for masks were imported from China and since the outbreak, many factories had shut down. With reprieve not in sight, respirators are selling for a premium in the grey market.
