2020-01-27
BENGALURU: The city's first reported suspected case of possible exposure to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) has turned out to be negative, say health department officials. 

 The middle age man from Yelahanka, who had visited the affected city of Wuhan in Hubei province in China, arrived in Bengaluru on January 19 and was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) on January 21. Samples have been sent to the National Virology Institute in Pune for testing. BG Prakash Kumar, state joint director (communicable diseases), said, "Only one suspected case has been reported. Six cases of asymptomatic high-risk patients - four businessmen from China and a medical student and a business professional from Bengaluru who visited Wuhan - have been quarantined for a 28-day observation." 

RGICD director C Nagaraja claimed two more suspected cases were admitted to the institute on Sunday. "Two self-reported cases showed symptoms like cough and fever," he said. 


Patients hadn’t travelled to China
He added that it does not seem to be a suspected case of exposure to the virus. The patients — a Bengaluru-based woman and a man from Kerala — had not travelled to China. Central teams will arrive in Bengaluru on Monday to take stock of the situation.

A 12-bed isolation ward has been kept ready at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases for admission of suspected cases of exposure to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV).
