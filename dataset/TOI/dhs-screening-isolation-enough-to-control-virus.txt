DHS: Screening, isolation enough to control virus
2020-03-13
Ponda: Rejecting the possibility of screening machinery at different tourist destinations, the directorate of health services is of the opinion that a centralised screening system at the airport and quarantining of suspected infected persons are sufficient to keep the disease at bay in Goa.

Following the outbreak of Covid-19, Shri Mangesh temple at Mangeshi Ponda had requested the state health department to install thermal screening machinery at the entrance. 

But the health services directorate has said there is no need for such measures at every place. 

“We have been screening passengers from foreign countries at the airport and if any person is found with an infection, or similar symptoms, we shift them to Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC) for medical aid,” Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the DHS said.

“The incubation period for coronavirus is 14 days but we either hotel quarantine or house quarantine the suspected infected person for at least 15 days to refrain him from moving out into public places,” he added. 

Shri Mangesh temple secretary Sudin Ambe said they have already kept hand wash available for visitors and ascertained that the temple staff, including the priest, who have direct access to visitors wear masks.
