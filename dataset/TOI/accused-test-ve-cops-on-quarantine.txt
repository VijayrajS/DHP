2020-06-03
Udaipur: The entire staff of Kotwali police station in Chittorgarh was quarantined on Tuesday after two members of a motorcycle theft gang tested positive for Covid-19. 

The incident was a shocker for Chittorgarh police as cops were in contact with many people daily and anyone being infected would mean the risk of community spread.

The Kotwali station and a special team had busted the gang on May 29 and arrested 2 men while a juvenile was detained. Before sending them to judicial custody, the court instructed police to conduct Covid-19 test which found them positive. Chittorgarh SP Deepak Bhargav said all of them have been admitted to the district hospital. “Samples of all the cops who were involved in the case and came in contact with the gang during investigations have been collected and send for testing besides being quarantined. The special task force which helped in the investigation too has been called off from duty while a new team has been deployed at the police station. The police station has been sanitised,” the officer said.
