Bareilly: Five migrant labourers, who had boarded the Shramik special train in Punjab’s Amritsar, were detained by the Government Railway Police and later quarantined in Shahjahanpur on Friday morning after they jumped off the moving train. The labourers, all residents of Khudaganj area of Shahjahanpur district, had jumped off the moving train at Roza railway station as the train slowed down to change the track.

The labourers later told GRP that the superfast train was going to Gonda while they were under the impression that the train would halt at either Bareilly or Shahjahanpur railway stations.

They had reportedly undergone health check-ups in Amritsar before boarding the train. Since they had the journey tickets and were given misinformation by someone in Amritsar, police dropped the idea of filing any complaint.

They were identified as Arvind Singh (37), his cousins Munendra Singh (28), Sethpal, Dharmendra and Sonu.

Roza police station house officer Ashok Pal told TOI, “Railway police had handed over the migrant labourers to us and we didn’t find any reason to penalise them as they were misinformed that the train would stop at Bareilly. They jumped off the running train but escaped any injury as it was moving at a slow pace.”

Meanwhile, additional director general of police (Bareilly zone) Avinash Chandra has ordered policemen to look for migrant labourers walking on the railway tracks and provide them possible support to ensure that they reach their destination safely.

“I have instructed the officials to ensure that regular patrolling is done on railway tracks. If they find migrant labourers walking on tracks, they should help them. I have also told policemen not to misbehave with any migrant labourer. Buses are being provided to them and labourers from other states are being dropped at the states’ borders.”
