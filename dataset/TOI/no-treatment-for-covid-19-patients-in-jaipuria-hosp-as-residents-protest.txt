JAIPUR: Amid protest from the residents in the nearby areas, the health department has decided to shift Covid-19 patients from the government-run Jaipuria Hospital to RUHS Hospital in Pratap Nagar area of the city.


Undergoing treatment at Jaipuria Hospital, the Covid-19 patients have been asked to pack their bags as they will not get further treatment in the hospital.

Citing protest, health minister Raghu Sharma on Thursday said that those Covid-19 patients, who have been undergoing treatment at Jaipuria Hospital for the past few days, will be shifted to RUHS Hospital. “In Jaipuria Hospital, treatment of Covid-19 positive patients will not be done,” Sharma said.

The health department has issued directions for disinfecting Jaipuria Hospital. “We have issued directions to complete the work for disinfecting the hospital completely after shifting all the Covid-19 patients to another hospital,” Sharma said.

The hospital will be opened for patients suffering from other illnesses like it was working earlier, before Covid-19 patients were shifted to the hospital.

The protest was spearheaded by BJP leader and local MLA from the area, Kalicharan Saraf. He had written letters to chief minister Ashok Gehlot demanding to shift the Covid-19 patients to other hospitals. Saraf said at least 10 lakh people from Malviya Nagar, Sanganer and Bagru area will be benefitted by the decision. He said that the out-patient department (OPD) here registers 3,000 patients on normal days, but it has reduced to zero once the treatment of coronavirus patients started at the hospital.

Besides, residents of the area displayed black flags outside their houses protesting against the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the area. Saraf said it is because of the protest of the people that the state government had to withdraw its decision and shift the Covid-19 patients to other hospital.
