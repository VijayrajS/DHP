Lockdown helps Bihar police trace ‘missing’ persons
2020-05-09
PATNA: The lockdown has its other advantages than containing Covid-19 spread. It has helped police trace persons going missing from home. Some of the cases are related to persons with learning difficulties, who could not have got traced easily in normal situation.


Two such cases have surfaced in Rupaspur police station area in Patna. A 12-year-old child and the middle-aged wife of a DSP posted in Bihar Military Police were traced soon after they had gone missing.

Rupaspur police station SHO Chandra Bhanu said the child went missing a week back from his accommodation at Vijay Nagar when no one in his family was at home. “He was traced after four days on May 5. He was unable to go far due to non-availability of transportation,” Bhanu said, adding the child’s mother works as a domestic help while father is a mason. 

Bhanu said the DSP’s wife lived with her two daughters in Rupaspur area while the officer is posted in another district. “She was under medication for mental stress. Two weeks back, she left home for purchasing fruits and went missing. But she was found at Hanuman Mandir near Patna Junction the very next day,” he said, adding it would have been difficult in normal situation to trace her so fast.

The SHO said police have failed to trace several persons who went missing before the lockdown.

Digha police station SHO Manoj Kumar Singh also said missing persons are getting traced quickly and easily due to the lockdown. “A teacher’s 19-year-old son with learning difficulties went missing from their Bank Colony residence a fortnight back. But he was traced at Gandhi Ghat within 24 hours,” he said. 

Another 23-year-old girl with learning difficulties went missing from her rented accommodation at Anand Puri under Patliputra police station on May 1. SHO SK Shahi said the victim was traced at Rupaspur.
