2020-03-28
ISLAMABAD: The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan rose to 1,300 after more people were tested positive for the disease across the country on Friday. There are fears that limited testing is understating the true scale of the outbreak. Without any official announcement by PM Imran Khan-led government, the country is in a lockdown with only grocery and medical stores allowed to stay open.


Meanwhile, people crowded into mosques on Friday, fuelling fears of a health crisis. In contrast to many other Muslim countries, Pakistani clerics and government officials have refused to close mosques.
