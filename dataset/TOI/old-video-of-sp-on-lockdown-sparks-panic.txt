2020-05-12
AURANGABAD: An old video of Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil saying that the lockdown would be further extended created confusion among people, forcing the officer to issue a clarification and quash rumours.

The video, the source of which police are investigating, mysteriously appeared online with a false claim that the lockdown 3.0 is going to be extended till May 30.

The circulation of the video resulted in the spreading of rumours on social media. This was followed by people adding their personal views and advice, asking people to be ready for more hardships and stock up on essential commodities.

Within first few hours of the day, the video was found to have been shared multiple times in innumerable groups, creating panic among people.

This also resulted into a series of phone calls and messages seeking confirmation about the lockdown confirmation from the senior authorities in the police and administration department besides journalists. 

Patil issued directives to find out the source of the video and took to social media to quash the rumours, besides issuing a video message as well as a written statement. 

“The video, which is freshly being shared and circulated, was the one released on April 13 and it talks about the lockdown till month-end then. But some miscreants forwarded the same by falsely claiming it to have been released today,” she said in her message.

Patil said police were trying to find the suspect and appropriate action would be taken for spreading rumours. She also clarified that if any extension in the lockdown is to be announced, it is done either by the government or by the district collector, and not police.

Police sources said that depending on the findings, the rural police are likely to register an offence against the suspect for spreading rumours and creating panic among people.
