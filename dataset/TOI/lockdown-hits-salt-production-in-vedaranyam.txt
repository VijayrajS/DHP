Lockdown hits salt production in Vedaranyam
2020-03-26
NAGAPATTINAM: The curfew in place from Tuesday evening has halted the movement of tonnes of salt from the salterns in Vedaranyam to various states in the country, as truckers are asked not to operate their vehicles. Saltpan owners say that this would lead to revenue loss worth lakhs of rupees.


To curtail the spread of Covid-19, the state government has imposed a curfew from 6 pm on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on the same say Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a lockdown until April 14. This has brought the production as well as the movement of tonnes of salt worth several lakhs of rupees to a grinding halt in Vedaranyam in the district. Around 75,000 tonnes of salt, meant to transport across the state and the neighbouring states such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, are lying in the salterns owing to the curfew, saltpan owners said. 

Salt is being produced in about 9,000 acres in Vedaranyam, Agasthiyampalli and Kodiyakkarai coast of which nearly 6,000 acres were run by two corporates companies. The remaining 3,000 acres are owned by about 900 individual licensees affiliated to Vedaranyam Small and Medium Scale Salt Producers’ Federation.

Around 2,250 tonnes salt is being produced in 9,000 acres on a daily basis, where around 10,000 people are working. Nearly 5,000 people are benefitted indirectly from the salterns, V Senthil, secretary of the federation, said. “Every day we produce salt worth Rs 17 lakh. However, the entire work has been stalled. Though this is not a peak season for production, but we will face revenue loss to the tune of Rs 17 lakh per day. Moreover, around 75,000 tonnes of salt are kept on the salterns itself, as we are not able to transport it,” Senthil added.
