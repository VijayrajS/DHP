2020-06-08
PUNE: State home minister Anil Deshmukh said here on Sunday that former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis must refrain from indulging in politics when all parties in the state are working together in the fight against the pandemic. 

Deshmukh was responding to a query at a press conference regarding Fadnavis’ recent remarks wherein he was being critical of the state government’s handling of the pandemic. “Even union minister Nitin Gadkari has praised the state government for its effort in tackling the crisis,” the home minister said. 

On the rising coronavirus cases among police personnel, prison inmates and jail staffers, Deshmukh stated, “There are about 12,000 policemen above 55 years of age, who have been asked to stay at home. We have arranged dedicated hospitals for the police in 24 districts. They can also avail an advance of Rs1 lakh for their treatment.”

The minister said the authorities were working on reducing the jail population to around 17,000 by releasing more prisoners on temporary bail and parole in the days to come.
