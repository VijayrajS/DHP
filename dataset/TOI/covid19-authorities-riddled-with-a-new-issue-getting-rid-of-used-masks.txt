#Covid19: Authorities riddled with a new issue — getting rid of used masks
2020-03-17
While all precautionary measures explain that COVID-19 is not airborne, and that it is only the infected persons, and those treating them, who should be wearing these masks to contain the virus, Bengalureans seem to be going all out to stock up on masks.
Masks and hand sanitzers are flying off shelves, thanks to panic-driven citizens. In addition to the fact that a simple mask once sold for `20 each, is now being sold for a good `200, there are also rumours of used masks being resold.
This brings us back to the precautionary mandate shared by authorities: Use a mask only if you are infected with the virus; otherwise, stick to maintaining personal hygiene. Moreover, one should also consider the ecological impact that this use and throw attitude is going to leave.

We have educated and instructed our solid waste management teams about handling used masks. Any mask found with waste will be separated, and taken to our disposal grounds for incineration. We are taking all measures to curb the spread of the virus.
