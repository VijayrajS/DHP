2020-05-10
Dumka: Deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B has issued a showcause notice to Sariyahat block development officer (BDO) Dayanand Jaiswal and an in-charge of a quarantine centre here for allowing a barber to shave the head of an inmate at the centre, who later tested positive for Covid-19. The identity of the quarantine centre in-charge is yet to be ascertained.

The incident happened in between May 2 and 5, when two migrants who returned from Gurgaon in Harayana were lodged at the quarantine centre. A local barber was called to the centre to shave the head of one of the migrants, whose father had died. Later, when their test results came on May 5, both tested positive.

However, district administration officials on Saturday heaved a sigh of relief on Saturday after test reports of 46 people, including the barber and 24 others of a high-risk group, who came in contact with the patient, returned negative.

Talking to TOI, Rajeshwari said, “I have showcaused the BDO and the quarantine centre in-charge on dereliction of duty for allowing the barber. I am yet to receive their replies.”

She added, “The good thing is that 46 people, including the barber and 24 others of the high-risk group, tested negative today. We have discharged them with advice for home quarantine.”

During contact-tracing, the district administration found that the barber had also went to the patient’s house to shave heads of other family members.
