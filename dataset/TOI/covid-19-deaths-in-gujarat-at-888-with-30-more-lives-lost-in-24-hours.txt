2020-05-26
AHMEDABAD: The death march of Covid-19 continued unabated in Gujarat as 30 more people succumbed to the virus in 24 hours on Monday, pushing the death toll to the ominous figure of 888. State recorded 405 cases, taking the total tally to 14,468. It's the highest case tally in a day for the state in 20 days as it breached 400 case-mark - recording seven Covid cases every two minutes. 



Of the 30 deaths, 25 were reported from Ahmedabad, three from Gandhinagar and one each from Surat and Anand. Conforming to the international trend, analysis of Gujarat’s deaths reveal that 65% of male patients had died. Out of 888 deaths so far, 576 are males. Analysis of 548 deaths from May 1to 24 in Ahmedabad shows a slightly higher percentage of 66.3% deaths of males.

Dr Tushar Patel, city-based critical care specialist, said number of patients with comorbidities is comparatively higher among men. “Two factors of older age and co-morbidities have resulted in high mortality ratio for several patients. It’s the trend also seen in several other non-communicable diseases like diabetes.”

A senior medical officer at Civil hospital also confirmed the trend. “When we compare patients by gender, men tend to have higher viral load with more exposure to the virus. In most women, it was the transmission through their family. But in higher age groups, I believe the death rate is nearly the same,” he said. He added that biologically, women are a stronger gender and similar trends were observed in other viral outbreaks in the past. Of the 405 new cases, 310 were from Ahmedabad, 31 from Surat, 18 from Vadodara and 12 from Sabarkantha. It was second highest tally in a single day ever for Ahmedabad district. On May 5, Ahmedabad had recorded 349 cases.

“Gujarat recorded discharge of 224 patients, taking the total to 6,636. The discharged patients include 136 from Ahmedabad, 34 from Surat, 13 from Vadodara and 11 from Rajkot,” said a senior state health department official. “Number of active patients in Gujarat is at 48% now. Out of 14,468 total cases, 6636 (46%) are discharged and 888 (6%) are dead.”

Out of active patients, 6835 patients are stable, and record 109 patients are on ventilator in the state as on Monday evening. It’s for the first time that the number of patients on ventilator has reached above the 100-mark.
