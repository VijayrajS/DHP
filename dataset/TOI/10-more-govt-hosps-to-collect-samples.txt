Hospitals authorised to collect samples for testing of Covid-19 include Lok Nayak, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, Babu Jagjivan Ram, Hindu Rao, Guru Tegh Bahadur, Maharishi Valmiki and Dr Hedgewar .

“The staff have been trained for sample collection,” said a Delhi government official.

“People with travel history to countries affected by Covid-19 or history of direct contact with an infected person can call the 24X7 helpline of the state or the Centre and the officials will contact them. Once they are satisfied about the need for testing, the person will be transported in CATS ambulance reserved for the purpose to the sample collection centre,” said another official.

Testing for Covid-19 involves collecting sample of the throat and nose swab of the person. 

“We have been witnessing long queues at our centre for sample collection for Covid-19. It is important for the other centres to come up so the work is divided and patients don’t have to wait for long,” said a doctor at RML hospital.
