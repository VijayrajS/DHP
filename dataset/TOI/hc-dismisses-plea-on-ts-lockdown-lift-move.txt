HC dismisses plea on Telangana’s lockdown lift move
2020-06-10
HYDERABAD: The high court on Tuesday dismissed a public interest litigation filed by social activist Sunita Krishnan who questioned the wisdom behind lifting the lockdown when Covid-19 cases are on the rise. 

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy heard senior counsel L Ravichander said, “Their data shows one thing and their decision says another,” he said.

 A few days ago, the HC refused to grant permission to hold SSC exams in Hyderabad due to a spurt in Covid-19 cases. The HC too has not yet opened for the very same reason, he added. 

The bench said that there is a distinction between imposing people to go out and people voluntarily going out. In case of SSC exams and reopening of HC, there is an element of compulsion. “Once you hold exams or courts, there is a compulsion for students and lawyers to be there. But the state is not forcing people to go out because it lifted lockdown,” the bench said while dismissing the plea.
