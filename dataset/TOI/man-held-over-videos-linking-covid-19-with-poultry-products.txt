Pune: The cybercrime cell of the Pune police, in the last two days, arrested a man from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and questioned a 16-year-old boy from Uttar Pradesh for allegedly uploading and circulating videos linking Covid-19 with consumption of poultry products.

Officials of state Animal Husbandry Department had approached the Pune police on February 19 to lodge a complaint in this regard with the cybercrime police station.

Joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve said, “There were two videos which appealed to people not to consume chicken, eggs or other meat as they were behind the spread of Covid–19. These were unscientific videos but were uploaded by the arrested man and the questioned minor without doing a background check.” 

According to the Animal Husbandry Department officials, the poultry industry incurred a loss of around Rs 6,000 crore in the last two months, with fake and misleading videos linking contagion spread with poultry products playing a huge role in it.

Shisve identified the arrested as Mohammed Abdul Sattar. A team comprising deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam and inspector Jayram Paygude tracked down the IP addresses of the electronic devices used to upload and circulate the misleading videos.

The minor boy used his aunty’s cellphone to upload the video, while Sattar used his smartphone to upload the videos on his video channel, Shisve said, adding that the police would soon file a chargesheet against the man. 

The police are also searching for the other suspects in the case.
