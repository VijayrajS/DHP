2020-03-23
INDORE: Passenger movement to and from city remained low like never before on Sunday with most trains and buses discontinued due to coronavirus threat. All interstate and intercity bus operations were shut, movement of all passenger, express, superfast trains and DEMU including those operating from Indore were also cancelled. Movement of passenger buses was also halted. This gave a hard time to people travelling from nearby districts like Sagar, Guna, Bhopal, or even Ujjain to Indore as their tickets were cancelled last minute. Entry of passengers at Indore and nearby stations and at railways reservation counters were also closed as preventive measure by divisional railway authorities. 

“All passenger trains including mail and express have been cancelled till March 31 with immediate effect to prevent spread of corona. Railways reservation office and ticket counters will also remain closed during this period,” spokesman with Ratlam division of Western Railway said on Sunday. 

“A decision in this regard has been taken by railway board,” he added. 

Some of the airline continued domestic flight operations to and from Indore under strict watch of airport authorities. “Around 20 flights operated to and from Indore while 19 were cancelled by airlines,” said officials. Airport director Aryama Sanyal said that all possible arrangements have been made to ensure safe movement of passengers to and from airport. “We are keeping a close watch on passenger movement with emergency as well as health desk facility available for passengers’ assistance,” she said, adding that they have closed down most commercial outlets on airport premises to control additional pressure of passengers. “We have appealed to passengers not to spread rumours or create panic in case of emergency,” she added.
