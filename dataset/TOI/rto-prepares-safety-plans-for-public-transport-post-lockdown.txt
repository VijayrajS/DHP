2020-05-14
Bareilly: The Bareilly Regional Transport Office (RTO) is gearing up to permit operations of public transport vehicles, including autorickshaws and e-rickshaws, in the city post Covid-19 lockdown - with strict safety measures in place.Officials at RTO said that meetings were held with divisional commissioner Ranvir Prasad and auto drivers’ union where points related to operation of public transport vehicles and important aspects of social distancing were discussed.Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, senior assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) RP Singh said, “It is not yet clear whether there will be relaxation in lockdown post May 17. However, planning is underway as to how the public vehicles will operate with physical distancing of passengers while commuting. During a recent meeting with divisional commissioner and members of auto drivers’ union, various aspects pertaining to social distancing in public transport vehicles and precautions to be followed by drivers, in case of relaxation, were discussed at length."ARTO Singh added, “Public transport drivers are being told that whenever they start operations in the city or even in the outer areas, they will have to mandatorily ensure that there is zero contact between the driver and passenger. Also, only two passengers besides the driver will be allowed at a time in a vehicle. Plans are also afoot to ensure a temporary partition within the vehicles to ensure passengers on board do not come in close contact with each other or the driver. This could be done by using plastic sheets.”Officials at RTO said that even if the lockdown is completely lifted, public transport drivers will have to adhere to the rules that are followed in precaution against the spread of infection, such as use of face masks, hand gloves and hand sanitisers.Bareilly was placed under red zone after multiple Covid positive cases were reported from different city localities earlier in May. District administration had declared three places —Hajiyapur, Brahmapura and Shahbazpur village on city outers — as hotspots. Later, Hajiyapur and Brahmapura were taken off the hotspot list after all the cases were reported negative. Lockdown guidelines are still being strictly followed by locals in these areas.
