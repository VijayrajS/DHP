HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police are using drones to improve surveillance and crack down on lockdown violators.


These drones are equipped with surveillance cameras, thermal imaging payloads and sky speaker for public announcements. 

Cyberabad police made an announcement in this regard on Twitter on Thursday. “Cyberabad police are taking all possible measures to enforce state-wide lockdown and stop the spread of coronavirus. We are using Cyient drone-based inspection capability to monitor the situation through drone cameras and thermal imaging technology,” the tweet said. At night, using thermal imaging technology the drones will give live feed to the police in command control room, about the movement of people. Even in areas where there are no streetlights, these cameras can given information on people’s movement. 

As of now, police are using two drone cameras. Due to dearth of manpower, the police department is finding it hard to track the movement of lockdown violators in locations where there is no police presence. 

These drones are being used in different places and if violation is detected, police are sent to there.

Using cameras, police can make public announcements on the street since it has an audio output facility.
