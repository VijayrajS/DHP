Hospicio scales up resources in fight against Covid-19
2020-04-04
Margao: With many private clinics and hospitals across South Goa being either shut or having scaled down operations, Hospicio, Margao, is battling on two fronts – catering to general patients needing emergency treatment, and those showing symptoms of Covid-19. 

The district hospital has now stepped up its preparedness level to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic by gearing up all its resources. 

While a screening centre has been set up near the hospital’s entrance, the establishment of two more Covid-19 out-patient departments (OPD) has taken the total to three. Doctors at these OPDs consult patients turning up with respiratory illnesses. 

Besides, three teams of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff have been constituted to handle any emergency in the event of a spurt in Covid-19 cases.

“At the screening centre, patients presenting Covid-19 symptoms and having travel history are directed to the Covid-19 OPDs. Those not showing any symptoms of respiratory illness nor having travel history area are sent to the general emergency OPDs,” Hospicio’s medical superintendent, Dr Ira Almeida, told TOI. 

Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, has issued an advisory to its members suggesting that doctors above 60 years of age refrain from providing OPD services as far as possible. 

Other doctors have been advised to keep their out-patient departments open provided they have proper staff and social distancing is maintained in the waiting hall and throughout consultation time.
