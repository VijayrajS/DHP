 These people have showed symptoms of cold and flu, and their blood samples are being taken for Covid-19 testing at PGI Rohtak, health officials said.

 Gurugram's chief medical officer JS Puniya told TOI that they have identified all the 420 residents who recently travelled to China, Malaysia and Thailand. 

 "Though 14 days' isolation is adequate, we have asked these people to stay in self-quarantine at home for 28 days. We are also collecting their blood samples for testing for Covid-19," he said. 

Meanwhile, the district health authorities on Saturday constituted 31 rapid response teams and urged residents to submit self-declaration of their travel history. This comes a day after a 25-year-old employee of SAR Group in Gurugram tested positive for Covid-19.
