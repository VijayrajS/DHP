Covid-19: Plea to close Tasmac shops dismissed
2020-03-20
Madurai: Madras high court has dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought to close all Tasmac liquor shops in the state to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In the petition, C Sankar, a resident of Virudhunagar district, stated that the state government as a part of the precautionary measure to restrict public gatherings had ordered to close stadiums, clubs, recreation clubs, bars including Tasmac bars from March 17 to 31. He stated that though the order included the closure of Tasmac bars, the shops continue to remain open. Due to this, hundreds of people are gathering at these shops to purchase liquor which would not serve the purpose of the precautionary steps taken by the government. He stated that it is necessary not only to close the Tasmac bars but also the shops in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench. When the petition was taken up for hearing on Thursday, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi dismissed the petition, citing that a similar petition is pending before the principal seat at Chennai.TNN
