One of the newer additions to the tourist hotspots in the capital, the park sees an approximate daily footfall of 5,000. This often goes up to 10,000 on weekends and during public holidays.

A senior official said the park had seen a dip in the number of visitors because of the Board exams. The coronavirus scare has only caused the numbers to decline further. “We have seen a drop of 30% in the average footfall,” the official said. The civic body has been sanitising ticket counters, gates and railings to prevent infection.

Inaugurated in February last year, the park features replicas of several wonders of the world, including Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal. These have been built using 150 tonnes of industrial and other waste. Kangra and SDMC standing committee chairman Bhupender Gupta convened a joint review meeting of the civic departments to review the preparedness to contain the spread of Covid-19. Kangra said five lakh pamphlets had been distributed to citizens to create awareness on the issue.

She also directed the public health and environment management services departments to distribute hand gloves, sanitisers and face masks to all safai karamcharis. The civic body has decided to limit the public dealings of the mayor office. Gupta said: “Citizens can send their complaints or suggestions through e-mails or WhatsApp.”
