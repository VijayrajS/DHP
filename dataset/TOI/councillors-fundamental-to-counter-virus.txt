‘Councillors fundamental to counter virus’
2020-03-17
Vijayawada: Minister for panchayat raj and rural development and mines and geology Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy said that tackling coronavirus needs social action in the form of advocacy, awareness and community activity, besides individual care and personal hygiene. He also said that elected representatives of local bodies can be very effective in this endeavour.

“The efforts of the elected representatives can be supplemented by government officials and health functionaries, identification of cases of coronavirus, home isolation of those cases and creating awareness about coronavirus at the grass-root level can be done effectively by the elected representatives of local bodies like ZPTC, MPTC, grama sarpanch, ward members, and municipal chairmen and councillors,” Ramachandra Reddy said. He further added that unlike MPs and MLAs, the constituency of ward members/village secretaries is limited both geographically and population-wise and hence they are in a better position to know each and every person of his constituency. tnn
