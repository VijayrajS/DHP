As country extends lockdown, crisis deepens for migrants in Hyderabad
2020-04-16
HYDERABAD: As many as 25 migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh have been stuck in the city without work ever since the sudden imposition of the lockdown. 


The workers, who work in the construction sector, said they have neither received the 12 kg free rice nor Rs 500 cash that was announced by the state government. To make matters worse, they have run out of savings and the thought of staying away from their families for a long time has plunged many of them into depression. 

Many of the migrants TOI spoke to said they want to return home and join their families, adding that they had booked train tickets hoping to return home after the lockdown is lifted on April 14. 

“We cannot go back as the train services are also shut. The lockdown has been extended up to May 3. Our families in UP are worried about us and want us to return. I request the government to arrange some transport facility for us and help us return home,” said Nand Lal, the eldest in the 25-member group.

Food is the foremost concern and the workers are staying in small rented rooms at Tata Chari Colony in Begumpet, with five persons packed into one room and sharing the rent. Expressing helplessness and anger, they said that their families are availing ration supplies back home in UP, even though they all have valid ration cards here. 

Meanwhile, a group of youngsters, MA Raheem, M Satish and Chandrasekhar among others are distributing packets of food to the migrants with the help of donations and their own contributions.
