PITHORAGARH: Stuck at the Indo-Nepal border in Dharchula for days, more than 1,000 Nepalese migrant workers have expressed their disappointment with Nepal’s decision to extend lockdown from April 7 to April 15. These workers, mostly daily wagers, are currently stranded at five entry points to Nepal in Pithoragarh district — Dharchula, Jauljibi, Baluakote, Dauda, and Jhulaghat. They have gone out of work due to lockdown in India and want to return to their homes in Nepal. 


“The district administration has arranged camps for these stranded workers at JSN Stadium, fire station, Government Inter College Baluakote, Baram, and Jauljibi. National Hydro Power Corporation, Dauliganga, is providing them with food, clothes, bed, and medical facilities and the camps are being run by the local administration. On Monday, 40 more Nepalese workers reached in Dharchula thinking that the border would have opened on April 7,” AK Shukla, SDM Dharchula, told TOI.

“Nepal government’s decision to extend lockdown till April 15 has disappointed us. The local administration here is providing us with food and shelter but we don’t know how our families are doing there. We have been waiting for the border to open for more than a week now. Now, we will have to wait for more,” said Krishna Bahadur, a Nepalese worker.

Another Nepalese worker Ramesh Ram told TOI, “We appeal to the Nepalese government to open the suspension bridge and allow us to return to our villages. We don’t know if our families have ration or not. All the workers in camps here are physically fit and no one has coronavirus-like symptoms. We are even ready to stay in quarantine in Nepal.”

“We will take care of all these workers until the lockdown is lifted. We are providing them with every necessary facility,” added SDM Shukla.
