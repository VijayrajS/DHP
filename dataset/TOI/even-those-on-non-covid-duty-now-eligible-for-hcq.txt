NEW DELHI: In an important decision, the health ministry on Friday revised its advisory on use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic for Covid-19 infection, expanding the drug’s use for asymptomatic healthcare and frontline workers deployed in Covid and non-Covid areas.

As per the fresh advisory, issued after ICMR conducted tests on the use of the medicine, all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment, such as Asha workers, municipal employees and police, those treating Covid-19 patients and asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-Covid hospitals or non-Covid areas of such hospitals or blocks, are now eligible for prophylactic use of HCQ.

The advisory said caution must be exercised in case of people with cardio rhythm disorders and hypersensitivity to the drug.

The decision came after the National Task Force for Covid-19 constituted by the ICMR reviewed the use of HCQ for prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection for “high-risk population” based on the emerging evidence on its safety and efficacy.
