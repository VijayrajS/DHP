Maharashtra: Central team warns of a surge in cases in hotspots after lockdown
2020-04-24
Acentral health team visiting Maharashtra to assess the Covid-19 situation in Pune and Mumbai has directed the state to be ready for a spike in cases in the coming weeks.


So far, the state has been claiming that the doubling rate had improved from the 3.1 days to 7.01 days.

The officials said more cases would surface after the lockdown period ends and the state will have to be ready with more centres for testing and more hospitals with beds to accommodate Covid-19 patients. 

Pune district on Thursday had registered 55 cases until 6pm taking the total up to 936. The numbers have varied between 50 and 70 cases a day in the last four days after the stringent eight-day lockdown began on Monday. Testing and surveillance would throw up more cases from the hotspots, a health official said. 

Another team member told TOI that they would submit their final analysis in two days.

“We have visited the hotspots in Pune and Mumbai and observed the measures taken to mitigate coronavirus. We have told the state authorities to be more prepared for a surge in cases after the lockdown ends,” a member told TOI on Thursday.

Two members who visited Baramati, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s constituency, to study the containment, said the steps were in order.

District collector Naval Kishore Ram said Pune showed more cases as it was testing more both in government and private laboratories. “We are prepared for more testing and have provided for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals,” he said. 

Pune’s divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, who met Sassoon General Hospital authorities representatives of private hospitals and private doctors on Thursday, has directed them to take extra care about identifying symptomatic patients, and taking special intervention in critical cases.
