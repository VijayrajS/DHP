Coimbatore: The district health department has allowed four private multispeciality hospitals in the city to set up 50-bed isolation facilities to treat patients with Covid-19 symptoms.

Collector K Rajamani on Saturday said the government has decided to allow Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, PSG Hospitals, Royal Care Hospital and Abhinand Hospital to admit and treat patients suspected of having Covid-19 and those tested positive. 

“The hospitals have been asked to keep ready isolation wards that have 50 to 60 beds,” he said.

While the hospitals can admit and treat patients, the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital will be the authorized centre to do the test. 

The health department is asking all those who were travelling and have Covid-19 symptoms to undergo the test, unlike earlier, when they were only testing people with specific symptoms so as to not overburden test centres and waste testing kits.

The collector also oversaw screening activities at the Walayar check post and Anaikatti. “All vehicles carrying essential commodities and patients with medical emergencies are allowed to enter the state,” said the collector. “We are also planning to establish another makeshift corona observation centre at Othakkalmandapam.”

Seven people who were tested at the Covid-19 test centre in CMCH have tested negative and so have four people tested on Thursday, health department sources said. This includes a 77-year-old man who visited Mumbai, a couple from Mettupalayam who returned from Sweden and a girl who returned from Spain.

Three patients were isolated at the CMCH and ESIC Hospital on Saturday include a three-year-old boy who has cold and fever. The boy and his family had recently returned from Rajasthan. The others are a 45-year-old man who returned from Odisha and a 35-year-old man who had been to Germany.
