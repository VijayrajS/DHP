Goa: No entry for visitors at RTO till lockdown ends
2020-04-20
PANAJI: Since the complete digitisation of the transport department, officials had been accepting applications for licencing, fitness certification and vehicle registration online. Despite that, people prefer to visit the department’s offices.

“Now, people will have to learn how to send applications online. There will be a shift in the functioning as more applications will be sent online, we will modify ourselves accordingly,” transport director Rajan Satardekar said.

There are a total of 75 documents including schemes that can be downloaded by citizens from the transport department website https://goatransport.gov.in/FormsDownload.

The provision was made so that citizens and registered transport vehicle owners don’t have to stand in line or visit the office to submit forms or follow up. It was also aimed at reducing paperwork and interaction between citizens and officials. Though the offices are opening on Monday after a long hiatus, the transport and RTO staff will only be engaging in backend work. The major work is that of driving licences, vehicle registrations, fitness certificates and issuing permits. There is however a blanket extension for the documents expiring during the lockdown. Last week, the government extended the validity of documents like driving licences, permits and registrations that expired since February 1, upto June 30. Operations like installation of high security registration plates (HSRP), fitness tests and driving tests will stay suspended until the lockdown ends.
