“The first batch of 300 Indian nationals returning from Iran on March 14 will be quarantined at Jaisalmer. On March 16, the second batch of 300 travellers from the same country will be screened at the facility,” a senior army officer from Army HQ, who did not wish to be named, told TOI over the phone. 

The first facility was at Manesar in Haryana where people returning from China were tested. “Since our doctors have knowledge about the screening, similar modules will be followed at the new facilities. Community medicines experts in the Armed Forces Medical Services are sharing their experiences,” another army officer told TOI on condition of anonymity. 

The army has directed all its command and field hospitals to create isolation wards. “Our priority is to have measures at unit levels where troops are working and staying together. Awareness programmes are being run at peace and field posts in the southern sector,” the officer added.
