Prayagraj: Police tightened security in Prayagraj on Sunday even as the streets remained deserted in the wake of the lockdown, following the murder of a man after an argument between two rival groups over the Covid-19 outbreak turned violent in Kareli.

Police booked 60 persons in the past 24 hours for allegedly violating rules of lockdown enforced to check the spread of the novel coronavirus and which entered its 11th day on Sunday.

Police also arrested 31 persons after lodging 15 FIRs under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with violations of section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code.

Five police teams kept vigil on Old City localities like Kareli, Attarsuiya, Kydganj, Shahganj and Kotwali with drones, while not allowing to sit outside their homes or roam in streets.

Barricades around 185 crossings and intersections in the district were put up to regulate non-essential traffic movement. 

SSP (Prayagraj) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “Over a dozen FIRs were registered in different parts of the city like Civil Lines, Colonelganj, Mutthiganj, Soraon, Handia, Naini, Bahariya, Sarayinayat and Koraon in the past 24 hours and 31 persons were arrested.”

The SSP added that a man was booked under section 3\7 of the Essential Commodities Act with Tharwai police station on charges of black marketing.

On Sunday, police sealed inter-district borders after putting a two- tier barricading system. Adequate police force was deployed at seven inter-district border areas. 

With the help of drones, police kept a tab if residents were practising social distancing. Mobile police teams were also deployed in Leader Road — the hub of wholesale medicine shops — to check if traders were following social distancing norms. 

Meanwhile, district authorities have prepared a list of 480 shops who would be roped in for delivery of essential commodities at Prayagraj residents’ doorsteps.
