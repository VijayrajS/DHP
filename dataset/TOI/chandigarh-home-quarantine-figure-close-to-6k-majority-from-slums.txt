2020-05-16
CHANDIGARH: The rise in Covid-19 positive cases took the count of city's home quarantined people to 5,900 by May 13 evening. Most of these numbers are from poor and packed colonies.


More than 3,000 of these people have completed quarantine period but been advised home stay of another 14 days as a precaution. As the city’s tally of Covid-19 positive cases approaches 200 (more than 185 having contracted the virus, so far), the UT administration has turned regular buildings into quarantine centres in different sectors, for the time when things get worse.

The administration has also used hotels to quarantine the flyers coming home from abroad. A source in the UT administration said: "Senior officers review the home quarantine situation daily and ensure that isolated people don't leave their home. Their need are being taken care of.”

Home quarantined people are spread across the city and dedicated teams of the civic body supply them with essential commodities at doorsteps for a charge. Special cleaners in protective gear lift their daily garbage. The MC and the UT information technology department developed a CVD Tracker app to keep the home quarantined people under watch. Police get an alert if any of them steps out. The app is a must-download for them.
