DEHRADUN: The state cabinet on Thursday decided to shut shopping malls across the state till March 31 in wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 


In the meeting, which was held at the secretariat, it was also decided that each MLA will give a fund of Rs 15 lakh from his MLALAD Fund to chief medical officer of his/her district for preparedness and preventive measures. 

The health officials have been directed to keep a special watch in Rishikesh and Tehri Garhwal, which witness a high number of foreigner footfalls. 

If required, the state has decided to use the rest houses of Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) and Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN) as isolation wards. A budget of Rs 60 crore has been reserved to tackle the situation. 

Sharing information, minister of urban development and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said, “The cabinet has decided that each legislator will give Rs 15 lakh from his MLA Local Area Development fund to the CMO of their respective district. The CMOs have been authorised to take decision as per requirement. If the need does not arise in the constituency of a particular legislator, the CMO has the right to use the fund in another MLA’s constituency area.” 

The chief secretary — who is also heading a task force on Covid-19— will review the situation on a daily basis, whereas CM Trivendra Singh Rawat will take stock of the development every second day. “Any decision will be taken on the basis of the day’s development,” added the minister.
