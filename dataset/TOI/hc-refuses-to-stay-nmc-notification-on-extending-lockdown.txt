Nagpur: In a disappointment to several citizens hoping for an early end to the lockdown, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday refused to stay Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) notification extending the lockdown and keeping the city in the red zone.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar directed the petitioners to place the case before regular bench for final hearing. “Several factual aspects are involved in the matter. Unless the notifications challenged are declared unconstitutional, it’s not possible for us to grant stay to it. Put up this matter in regular course,” the judges said.

The HC was hearing a bunch of petitions, including one by four lawyers — Shreerang Bhandarkar, Prakash Jaiswal, Kamal Satuja and Manoj Sable — challenging NMC chief Tukaram Mundhe’s decision to extend the lockdown in the city while allegedly ignoring the Centre and state government guidelines.

Earlier, NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik informed that the commissioner has issued notification on Thursday declaring Nagpur to be in the red zone. He also informed that the government has also included Nagpur in the red zone.

Interveners — former District Bar Association (DBA) president Sudeep Jaiswal and Satish Uke — earlier raised objections to the petition’s maintainability and also questioned the locus of petitioners. Expressing concern over professional ethics displayed by the petitioners, the interveners contended that such a case seeking relief of opening liquor shops ought not to have been filed by the lawyers.
