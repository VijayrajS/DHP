2020-05-31
RUDRAPUR: Even as the state government has enforced strict social distancing and other precautionary measures to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, several eateries and food cart owners were seen conducting business in violation of norms in Rudrapur. Throwing social distancing norms to the wind, gatherings of customers were seen at these food joints.

“We have received complaints regarding eateries and food cart owners in slum settlements and other residential colonies. The police department has been apprised of the matter. It must be very clear that only delivery of food is allowed during lockdown,” Rampal Singh, mayor of Rudrapur Municipal Corporation, told TOI.

Sanjay Juneja, president of the city traders’ union, echoed the mayor’s sentiment and said, “Food is sold at these joints in guise of home delivery. Police should take immediate actions against such vendors.”

However, several workers have advocated opening of eateries in the city. “These eateries and food carts are the only source of food for us. We understand that these joints do not provide hand sanitisation facility or follow distancing norms but what other option do we have,” said Manish Arya, an employee at a unit in Pantnagar industrial area.

Meanwhile, sub-divisional magistrate Mukta Mishra has assured stringent action against owners of these food joints which defy lockdown rules.
