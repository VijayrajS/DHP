Despite lockdown, Margao streets see increased footfalls
2020-04-03
Margao: As the second week of the lockdown progresses, the streets of Margao have begun witnessing increased movement of people and vehicles.

With the town’s three markets — the new municipal market, the Gandhi market and the SGPDA market — remaining shut, fruits and vegetable vendors descended onto footpaths and open spaces across Margao. People were seen rushing to make purchases, largely breaching social distancing restrictions. 

Most outlets of the state horticulture corporation were also open and were frequented by customers seeking to buy fruits and vegetables throughout the day.

Many grocery shops were open, too, though some retailers expressed concern over their dwindling stocks and non-arrival of goods from suppliers.

Though bars are closed, sources said liquor is being sold through the back door and also being delivered to customers at specified locations.

“Booze is freely available as seen from liquor bottles that are strewn in the open during the night. They somehow manage to evade the eye of the police,” a resident of Curchorem said, making a case for heightened police patrolling and stringent monitoring by the district administration.
