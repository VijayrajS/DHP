2020-04-16
BENGALURU: Two Covid-19 patients died in Karnataka and nine more employees of the Nanjangud pharma firm tested positive on Wednesday, pushing Mysuru ahead of Bengaluru Urban as the district with most active cases of Covid-19. Mysuru has 46 patients under treatment against 34 in Bengaluru.


Minister Suresh Kumar, in charge of Covid-19 briefings, said the pharma company owner had been traced to Delhi and efforts were on to find him. Across Karnataka, 19 cases were reported in the past 24 hours — a record jump — taking the total number of infected to 279. Four of those infected were primary contacts.

The state toll touched 12 with the two deaths: A 65-yearold Chikkaballapura man who had tested positive died at Victoria Hospital on Wednesday; an 80-year-old woman from Belagavi died on Monday and was confirmed positive later. Health authorities said the Chikkaballapura man was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with obstructive sleep apnea and had a history of uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension. He had also tested positive for H1N1Influenza A and was brought to Victoria on April 13. The Belagavi woman was a secondary contact of a Tablighi Jamaat delegate from the district.

Another potential TJ link cropped up as a constable in Bagalkot tested positive days after he was deployed for bandobast at a madrasa in Mudhol taluk. Twenty-five people had gathered for prayers on March 27, leading to a lathicharge. Among the participants was a TJ delegate from Gujarat who went on to test positive. The 39-yearold is the first cop on duty to test positive in the state.
