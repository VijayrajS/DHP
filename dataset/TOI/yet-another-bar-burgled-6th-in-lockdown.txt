2020-04-23
NAGPUR: Yet another liquor shop was targeted by burglars who decamped with several bottles of country-made and Indian-made foreign liquor worth Rs 54,080. With this, the number of liquor selling establishments targeted by miscreants during the lockdown in the city has reached six.


The burglary took place sometime between April 19 and April 21 in Utthan Nagar under Mankapur police jurisdiction.

In the latest incident, bar run by Hemant Pali, 54, was targeted by burglars who decamped with liquor bottles worth Rs54,080. The incident came to light on Tuesday following which Pali approached Mankapur police station where a case has been registered. 

Cops said the burglars broke open the lock of the front door before sneaking in and stealing the liquor.

Police are now scrutinizing CCTV footage from nearby spots to identify the culprits. Cops said prima facie it appears that two miscreants were involved in the burglary.

Since March 18, all bars and liquor shops in the city have been closed following the lockdown over the outbreak of Covid-19. All these establishments were sealed off by state excise officials.

Earlier, a country-made liquor shop in Kamptee and bars in areas like Jaripatka, Gaddigodam, Koradi and Nandanvan were targeted by miscreants who had fled with cash and liquor worth lakhs. Though the police had advised liquor shop owners to increase security at their shops, the thefts seem to have continued.

At a time when these establishment owners have been left with no income, the increasing number of thefts in liquor shops are being seen as a double whammy for them.

Even though police have increased patrolling, burglars seem to have outsmarted the cops on this front.
