BENGALURU: Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa has announced that he will donate an entire year’s salary to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to fight Covid-19. Handing over a cheque of Rs 24.1 lakh to chief secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar, Yediyurappa urged more ministers and legislators to come forward to donate during a grave crisis like this.
 

Official sources said the CM gets a fixed salary of Rs 2 lakh per month apart from a host of perks, including conveyance and rent-free accommodation, among others, which range between Rs 2 to 3 lakh. Deputy chief minister Govind Karjol also donated Rs 5 lakh towards the relief fund. 

In a tweet on Wednesday, Yediyurappa appealed to citizens to do their bit and contribute in whatever capacity possible to help the state in fighting the coronavirus outbreak.
