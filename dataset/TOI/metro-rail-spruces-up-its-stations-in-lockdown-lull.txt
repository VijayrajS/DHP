Hyderabad: Metro Rail spruces up its stations in lockdown lull
2020-05-01
HYDERABAD: As and when the lockdown ends, the city’s citizens, especially those who take the Hyderabad Metro Rail’s green line for their commute, will be pleasantly surprised to see the newly-laid cement concrete roads and completion of other street-level works in and around metro stations. 


The metro rail authorities seem to be making the most of the coronavirus induced lockdown to complete all the civil works along with the regular maintenance of trains and electrical systems across all the three metro corridors. 

 

“We are using the lockdown period to finish some pending works at metro stations. The laying of CC road at Sultan Bazaar station on the green line is happening at a brisk pace. We decided it is better to finish these works now because after the lockdown it might get further delayed, especially at Sultan Bazaar as it is one of busiest areas in the city,” said Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited managing director NVS Reddy adding that the works at Sultan Bazaar are expected to be completed by the first week of May. 

This apart, the authorities are also ensuring that the overhead electric traction and signalling network are being periodically checked to avoid technical glitches after the operations resume. 

“There are different systems to be maintained to ensure that the trains run smoothly as and when the lockdown is lifted. So, we are continuing the maintenance works, trials and checking all the sections, including the rolling stock, overhead electric traction and signalling on all three corridors,” said Reddy.
