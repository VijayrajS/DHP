AGRA: Two more men tested positive for Novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Aligarh on Monday, taking the total number of cases in the district to three. 

Confirming this, district magistrate (DM) CB Singh said that the duo - aged 32 and 55 years - were found positive and they belong to Niveri Aheldadpur and Usmanpara areas, respectively. The 55-year-old man is admitted to AMU’s medical college with respiratory issues and is at present on a ventilator, the DM said, adding that it was not immediately known how he got infected. 

The younger patient had reportedly come back from Delhi and was under home quarantine. His report also revealed that he was infected. But, he had no symptoms. “Both the areas are being sanitised by Municipal Corporation officials and will be sealed,” the DM said. 

He further said, “We have now decided not to open any government offices till April 27 - with these new cases coming up.” Though cement, brick kiln and food processing units in rural areas will be operational with limited manpower and social distancing rules, work at lock industry and industrial estate will not be allowed as yet, said officials, adding that decision in this regard will be taken after April 27. 

The district's first positive case was reported on April 9, when a 22-year-old Firozabad resident had come to Aligarh on March 12 to take part in a Jamaat event in the city.
