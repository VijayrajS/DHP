Lockdown bhajans focus on harmony in crisis

KOLKATA: Setting an example of communal harmony, Ustad Rashid Khan has started composing bhajans during the lockdown. Along with son Armaan, he has also done a virtual concert of his bhajan composition. He said, “This is my way of putting out a message of secularism and brotherhood for our society that is facing threats of communal division and Islamophobia.”


Khan said that music is his religion. “The world is reeling under a grave crisis and people are seeking refuge in spiritualism. Shunning communal hatred and Islamophobia is the need of the hour. Music is ibaadat (worship) for me. In times of uncertainty, singing bhajans gives me sukoon (peace),” he said.

The lyrics of Khan’s bhajans have been penned by Narayan Jha Agarwal. He has already composed three bhajans – ‘Dheere dheere re mana’ (raag Mishra Charukeshi), ‘Yeh andhiyara mit jayega’ (raag Mishra Salagvarari Todi) and ‘Subah ho shaam tera naam japu’ (raag Mishra Gorak Kalyan). “My son joins me with his guitar when I perform,” he said

Muslim musicians singing bhajans isn’t new in India. Md Rafi’s ‘Mana tarapat hari darshan ko aaj’ written by Shakeel Badayuni is unforgettable. Set on raag Malkauns, Naushad Ali had composed it for ‘Baiju Bawra’. “Rafisaab and Naushadji are my favourites. I was inspired by this bhajan. When people listen to it, they forget the religion of the singer, lyricist and the composer,” he said. Khan is expecting his bhajans to have a similar impact. “I wish they make listeners look inwards and imbibe a sense of calm. I hope this helps us tide over the situation,” he concluded.
