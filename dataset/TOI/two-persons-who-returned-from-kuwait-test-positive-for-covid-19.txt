JAIPUR: Two persons who landed in Jaipur from Kuwait tested positive for Covid-19 in the state.

The state government has allowed people stuck up in other countries to reach their homes in different parts of the state. The health authorities are taking strict measures to quarantine them for seven days after they land at airports in any district of the state. 

However, the health authorities said that despite being quarantined for seven days, some of them have tested positive for Covid-19 after reaching their homes. “Two persons from Kuwait have been tested positive for Covid-19,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health). 

According to health authorities, the two persons had landed in Jaipur on May 31 and they spent seven days at the quarantine facility, but they were found infected with the virus after reaching their homes. The health department has taken it on a serious note and issued directions to keep monitoring the health of those reaching Rajasthan from different countries.

An order issued by Singh mentioned that people reaching from other countries are being quarantined for seven days and seven days under home quarantine. But it has come to the notice of the state government that there are some of them who have tested positive for the virus after reaching home from institutional quarantine, which is a cause of concern. 

The order says that to break the chain of infection, it has been decided to conduct Covid-19 test before a person, who has reached from other country, gets shifted from institutional quarantine to home quarantine. 

The health department mentioned that the orders should be followed strictly to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and to break the chain of infection from infected person to healthy persons.
