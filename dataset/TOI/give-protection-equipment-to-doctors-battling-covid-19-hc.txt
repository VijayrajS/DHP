Give protection equipment to doctors battling Covid-19: Andhra Pradesh HC
2020-04-03
VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Thursday directed the state government to extend proper treatment to the patients tested positive for Covid-19 who first brought to ASRAM Hospital at Eluru and later shifted to Government General Hospital (GGH).


The HC on Wednesday took up the matter as a public interest litigation (PIL) based on news reports that the doctors and paramedical staff of ASRAM Hospital went on leave contending that they were not provided with necessary equipment, particularly the personal protection equipment (PPE) to treat Covid-19 patients.

The advocate appearing on behalf of the government said the reports were not true and the state government has provided 16 PPEs to the ASRAM Hospital. The HC directed the 1 additional district judge, T Mallikarjunarao, to visit the hospital and submit a report on the issue.

On receiving the report from Mallikarjunarao, the HC observed on Thursday that at the time of the statement made before the court the PPEs were not provided to the hospital staff. The PPEs were given after the high court passed the order on Wednesday. The state government counsel C Suman justified the government’s action referring to the chart prepared and rational use of PPE kits issued by World Health Organisation (WHO). 

The HC directed the state government to comply with the Supreme Court guidelines and the guidelines issued by the Union government while treating Covid-19 patients and provide necessary protection equipment to the doctors and medical staff treating such patients. — Srikanth Aluri
