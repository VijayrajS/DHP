Vijayawada: Coronavirus puts big fat weddings on hold
2020-05-29
VIJAYAWADA: Covid-19 had had a severe impact on the big fat weddings across the city. No fewer than 30,000 weddings in the city have been postponed due to the Covid-19. People have been eagerly waiting for the government to lift restrictions on huge celebrations so that they can celebrate weddings in a grand manner.

Due to fear of Covid-19, most wedding ceremonies have been postponed indefinitely.

The government has permitted weddings with a limited crowd of 50 persons and this move received very poor response from the public. “We have been waiting for a long time to celebrate my daughter’s wedding on a grand note. We fixed the wedding date as May 14 and cancelled it later. We are anticipating at least 400 guests and the government gave permission for 50 guests. Wedding is a very special occasion and we have decided to wait till Covid-19 pandemic ends,” said Koppuravuri Baradhwaj, a city-based businessman.

Wedding planners, event organisers, caterers, photographers, flower decorators, and others dependent on weddings are facing tough time with the postponement of weddings. “Summer is peak wedding season. But Covid-19 had had severe impact on event organisers. We lost our livelihoods in March,” said KN Ranjan a city-based wedding planner.
