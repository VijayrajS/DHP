NEW DELHI: At least 12 Covid-19 infected people have travelled in trains between March 13 and 16, the railways said on Saturday. In a tweet, the ministry said, “Railways has found some cases of coronavirus-infected passengers in trains which makes train travel risky. Avoid train travel as you may also get infected if your co-passenger has coronavirus. Postpone all journeys & keep yourself and your loved ones safe.”


Railways tweaks refund rules to avoid crowding

The railways also announced a change of refund rules to avoid crowding at stations. Railways said passengers can claim refund up to 90 days from the date of journey across counters instead of the current practice of three days in case a train is cancelled. This will be applicable for trains cancelled by the railways between March 21 and June 21. This even as the railway board ordered the closure of all rail museums, railways heritage parks and galleries till April 15.

The railways said that eight people who travelled on the AP Sampark Kranti train on March 13 have tested positive for coronavirus. “We have appealed people not to rush and avoid travelling. Trains that are already running before Sunday but are due to reach their destinations will not be stopped,” said an official.

He added that as per the relaxed refund rule, passengers will be fully refunded if they cancel their tickets for journeys till June 21 and for a refund for counter generated tickets passengers can approach any counter across the railway network.

The norms have also been relaxed for refund in case the passenger doesn’t want to travel even as the train has not been cancelled. Passengers can file ticket deposit receipt within 90 days from the date of journey.Passengers who want to cancel their tickets through 139 service, will get refunds within 90 days from the date of journey instead of the rule of up to scheduled departure of the train.
