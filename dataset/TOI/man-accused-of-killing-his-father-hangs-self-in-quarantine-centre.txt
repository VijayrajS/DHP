VADODARA: A man, who was detained for allegedly murdering his father in a village of Panchmahal district, committed suicide in a government Covid-19 quarantine facility in Godhra on Wednesday night.

The accused Pravin Parmar was brought to the quarantine facility on Tuesday for conducting Covid-19 test before formally arresting him.

According to police sources, Parmar, a resident of Nani Dasar village in the precincts of the Kakanpur police station, had allegedly strangled his father Narvat (56) on Monday afternoon. 

The complaint against Pravin stated that Narvat had tried to intervene in a bitter fight between his son and wife Rita on Monday. As Narvat reprimanded Pravin, he got furious and strangled his father at their residence. Pravin fled from the house, but was nabbed on Tuesday itself.

He was brought to the hostel of the Maize Research Station in Godhra where a quarantine facility has been set up. Health workers collected Pravin’s samples for Covid-19 test on the same day and he was kept at the facility as results were awaited.

Sometime on Wednesday night, Pravin hung himself using the cover of the mattress at the hostel. “He went to the gallery and used its grill to hang himself. Three other persons were sleeping in the same room as Pravin, but they did not come to know of the incident as it took place outside in the gallery,” said deputy superintendent of police Ramesh Desai.

Desai said that Pravin tested negative for Covid-19. As per the procedures, he would have faced arrest. It is believed that he took the extreme step out of guilt of having killed is own father.
