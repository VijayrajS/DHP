CHENNAI: Saravanan* was going about his usual business ferrying goods on his truck when he received a call that induced in him a terrible sense of panic.

The 35-year-old from Ooty was just crossing Anna Nagar tower around 2.30pm when a sub-inspector from Lovedale, Nilgiris, told him he had tested positive for Covid-19. Saravanan was inconsolable. He stopped his vehicle in the middle of the road and ran towards police from the Anna Nagar traffic enforcement division — who were checking vehicles at Anna Nagar tower point — begging them for help. He eventually sat on the road and began crying. It took police some time to console and then isolate him. 

Saravanan had reached Anna Nagar on Monday to load goods at the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies godown. The truck driver usually came to Koyambedu market to unload potatoes. Given the presence of a major cluster that originated from the market, officials were conducting a massive contact tracing operation.

As part of this exercise, Saravanan was asked to give samples at his hometown. Since he did not exhibit any symptoms, he came to Chennai as usual for work. He had just finished loading the goods and was back behind the wheel when he received the call. 

Police were surprised to see a man running towards them and the last thing they expected was him to be Covid-positive. He tried to hand over his phone to the officers saying he was just told he had tested positive for the infection. Police asked him to disconnect the call and keep his phone away. They guided him to the shade and helped him calm down. Other personnel, meanwhile, cleared the area of other motorists. 

“It took quite some time to console him. His hands began to shiver,” said inspector Shakthivel from Anna Nagar traffic enforcement. Police noticed that he was terrified of the pandemic and feared that the panic could pose bigger risk to his health.

Onlookers said officers spoke to him for around 30 minutes and that clearly made a huge difference as Saravanan began to relax and even drank the juice officers gave him. All this was done after officers donned necessary safety gear.

The ambulance arrived at the spot around 3.30pm and took the patient to Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital. The entire area was sprayed with disinfectant. The driver had come in contact with a few vehicles seized at the spot, so they too were cleaned with disinfectant.
