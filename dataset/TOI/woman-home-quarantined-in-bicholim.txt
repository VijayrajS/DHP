2020-03-29
Bicholim: Taking cognisance of the demand by Vathadev villagers to quarantine a woman who returned from a foreign trip recently, Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit on Saturday instructed health and police authorities to maintain a watch over the person as well as her family members.

The locals complained to the health department suspecting that the woman, who returned a week ago, has been affected by the Covid-19 disease. Officials later visited the womanâ€™s house and stamped her hand for home quarantine. 

However, after residents expressed their reservation over the decision, the mamlatdar instructed police and health authorities to ensure the woman is strictly isolated at home. He also directed that no one from the house should venture out and that they must adopt social distancing.
