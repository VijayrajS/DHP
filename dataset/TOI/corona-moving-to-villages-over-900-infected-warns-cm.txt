Coronavirus moving to villages, over 900 infected, warns MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan
2020-06-12
BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday sounded a warning note on Coronavirus creeping into rural areas, saying that 904 Covid-19 patients have been found in 440 villages of Madhya Pradesh.


To tackle this threat, Rs 275 crore — 15% of the amount received from 14th Finance Commission for rural development — has been allocated for Covid management in villages, he said.

In a video-conference with sarpanchs and ex-sarpanchs of 6,000 villages, Chouhan said he realises that Coronavirus infection has spread from urban areas to villages. “This money can be spent on purchase of mask, sanitisers, soap and PPE kits,” he said. Coronavirus patients in the state were recovering fast but there is greater need for caution now that unlocking has begun, he said. The CM asked district collectors to make IITT strategy — identify, isolate, test and treat — more effective to contain Coronavirus.

At a review meeting, Chouhan said that ‘unlocking’ is underway and any laxity at this stage may turn out to be dangerous. 

‘Fever clinics’ must be strengthened and made more effective, he advised.

The CM ordered an inquiry into the death of a Mantralaya employee, who had gone to a hospital but was given some medicines and allowed to go back home. When his condition deteriorated, he went to hospital again but could not be saved. Chouhan ordered that the persons responsible for this lapse should be identified and penalised

ACS-health Mohd. Suleman said at the meeting that Coronavirus positivity rate in MP is 4.42 as against the national average of 5.51, while recovery rate has risen to 68.8. In 22 districts, there are less than 10 Coronavirus patients and four districts — Hoshangabad Alirajpur, Seoni and Sehore — are Coronavirus-free.

It was revealed at the meeting that 915 people in Bhopal have been fined Rs 1.85 lakh for not wearing masks and for spitting.
