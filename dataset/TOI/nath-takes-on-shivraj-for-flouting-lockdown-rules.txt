2020-05-24
BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath on Saturday criticised chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and said BJP leaders did not observing social distancing norms during a political gathering in Bhopal. 


“Shivraj ji, during the Covid review meeting held on Friday, you warned people of the state to observe rules to contain the virus,” Nath tweeted. 

“For the common man, the number of persons permitted for weddings and funerals are fixed. People are strictly following rules and action is also being taken for violations,” Nath said. “At the same time, in your very presence, a crowded function was held at the state BJP headquarters in Bhopal today. No social distancing norms were followed. Such irresponsible incidents have also taken place before,” Nath said. The former chief minister said, “Does Prime Minister Narendra Modiji’s lockdown rules apply only for the poor and the common man? Does it not apply to the leaders of your party? Will action be taken for such blatant violation of the lockdown rules?” 

Nath also posted photographs of BJP leaders, including former ministers Rampal Singh and Prabhuram Choudhary, crowded on a dais at the meeting hall in the BJP state office. 

BJP reacted sharply.

“The BJP is trying to maintain all social distancing and lockdown norms. If there has been any violation of social distancing norms, then in future the BJP will take necessary precautions not to repeat the same situation again. However, in the function today, sanitiser was provided and all who attended were wearing masks, some even gloves. In over-enthusiasm, the social distancing norms may not have been maintained, but the party will keep this in mind in the future.” said BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal.
