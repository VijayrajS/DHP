City makes right noises to salute virus fighters
2020-03-23
Jaipur: People in Jaipur abided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call on ‘janta curfew’ on Sunday with no vehicles, or even people on roads. The day ended with families coming out on their balconies to clap and ring bells to salute those involved in essential services.

Jaipur witnessed almost complete silence when people of every age, caste, creed and religion preferred to stay indoors. Hardly any vehicles were seen on the roads.

TOI visited various parts of the city to know how Jaipur was responding to the ‘janta curfew’.

The only shops that opened in the morning were a few milk parlours and some grocery shops in the interiors of housing colonies. Police vehicles with loudspeakers made the rounds of streets and requested people to stay indoor. Medical stores, diagnostic centres were among those that opened across the city.

A bike-borne 25-year-old youth was stopped by policemen when he tried to enter through Chandpole Gate. “I am clicking pictures. I have never seen Jaipur like this,” he told the policemen.

The Jaipur railway station that witnesses a footfall of nearly 4 lakh people daily was empty, so was the road in front of it. Some generous voluntary groups and policemen organised food packets for street dewellers including beggars.

“We have prepared 500 food packets and are distributing them among the beggars. We also visited government hospitals to distribute food packets,” said a volunteer at Badi Chaupar.
