2020-03-24
Erode: With two Thai nationals testing positive for Covid-19 in Erode district, the IRT Perundurai Government Medical College (IRTPGMC) has been made to treat only Covid-19 related cases. The hospital houses two positive cases, besides 11 people, including four other Thai nationals, quarantined in an isolation ward.

The move follows after health officials are monitoring people who came into contact with the two positive cases. “The health department officials are closely monitoring 694 people of 169 families in the district. They were quarantined at their houses from Sunday,” collector C Kathiravan said. The hospital has 300 beds and doctors were equipped with enough facilities to treat new cases if they arise, he added. 

The collector also said patients who were treated for other aliments would be shifted to the government hospital in Erode city at the earliest. 

He warned against spreading fake news on social media and threatened to slap the Goondas Act against miscreants.
