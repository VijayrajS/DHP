2020-03-19
NEW DELHI: The Army has reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus at Leh, forcing a virtual lockdown of the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre there, even as the force has established extensive quarantine facilities at Jaisalmer and Jodhpur after Manesar to together provide for 1,600 civilians. 


Army chief General M M Naravane on Wednesday reviewed the facilities at the “wellness centre” set up at Jaisalmer, which now has almost 440 people, mainly evacuated from Iran, in quarantine for the mandatory 14-day period.

The first soldier to test “positive” is a 34-year-old jawan whose father had returned from a pilgrimage from Iran on an Air India flight on February 27. The jawan, who was on casual leave to his Chuchot village, and his father, who too has tested positive, have been “isolated” at the SNM hospital at Leh. His wife, sister and two children have also been quarantined.

The Army has banned all entry and exit from the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre at Leh, which houses over 500 personnel, as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. 

The Army, Navy and IAF, which together have over 14 lakh personnel, have already directed all formations and units to stop non-essential mass gatherings as well as travel to foreign countries.
