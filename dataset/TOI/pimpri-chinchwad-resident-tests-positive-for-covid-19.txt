PUNE: A 26-year-old resident of Pimpri Chinchwad tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) on Tuesday, taking the tally of infected patients in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad to 17. 


The man had returned from the US recently and was quarantined thereafter at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital in Pimpri, after he developed mild symptoms. 

Of the 17 cases in Pune, 10 are Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, while the other seven are from Pune. Incidentally, there has been no fresh case of the contagion within the limits of Pune Municipal Corporation in the past four days.

“He returned from the US on March 14. When he came to know that US has been placed on the list of countries to be monitored by the government for Covid-19 infection, he self-reported to YCM hospital on March 16. He is in good health and only has very mild symptoms,” municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said.

“There was no one at home when he came back from the US. Those he is likely to have interacted with on the way from Mumbai airport to Pune are still being traced. It is becoming difficult for people to recollect others they have interacted with or come in close contact with in the past 7-10 days. They take about 2-3 days to recollect and then we have to trace them,” Hardikar added.

“As many as 105 people suspected of carrying the infection were quarantined mainly in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Yavatmal on Tuesday alone. They include travellers and close contacts of patients who tested positive earlier,” said state surveillance officer Pradip Awate.

Meanwhile, a Union health ministry official said, “So far, India has reported 137 positive cases of Covid-19 as of 5pm on Tuesday. This includes 24 foreign nationals.”
