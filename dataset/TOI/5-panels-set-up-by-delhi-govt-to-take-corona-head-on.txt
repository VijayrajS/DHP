NEW DELHI: To effectively manage the multiple challenges posed by the novel coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, Delhi government has formed five empowered groups for planning and ensuring implementation of 11 Covid-related activities.


The groups, headed by senior bureaucrats with members from civil societies and expert bodies, will have to identify problems and provide effective solutions, make policies, formulate plans and strategise operations.

The five empowered groups are headed by additional chief secretary Satya Gopal, principal secretary (social welfare) PK Gupta, South Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner Gyanesh Bharti, food commissioner Ankita Mishra Bundela, and commissioner (trade and taxes) Vivek Pandey.

The empowered groups have been formed to manage the supply of essential medical equipment, like personal protective equipment, masks, gloves, ventilators, among others. They will have to facilitate the supply of food and medicines, coordinate with the private sector and international organisations, undertake economic and welfare measures, create awareness among the public, manage technology and data, resolve grievances and take suggestions related to the lockdown.

The order issued by special CEO of Delhi Disaster Management Authority on April 20 stated, “During deliberations, if any empowered group is of the view that a particular aspect is not within its domain and falls within the scope of another group, they may inform the chief secretary.”
