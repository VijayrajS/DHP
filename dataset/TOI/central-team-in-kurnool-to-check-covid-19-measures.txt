2020-05-09
TRUPATI: A public health team appointed by the Centre will inspect Covid-19 measures in Kurnool district for six days starting Saturday.

Following the nationwide rise in number of cases, the Centre had announced the formation of public health teams to investigate 20 districts across 10 states with the highest incidence of coronavirus cases. These teams, comprising experts from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), AIIMS, JIPMER and All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, among others, will carry out a detailed study on the disease outbreak in hotspots and submit their reports to the state health authorities with recommendations.

In Andhra Pradesh—which has reported 1,887 cases so far—the team will visit Kurnool, Guntur and Krishna districts, which have registered the highest number of cases.

Speaking to reporters in Kurnool, district collector G Veerapandian said a two-member committee comprising Dr Madhumitha, director at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health and Dr Sanjay Kumar, will reach Kurnool district on Saturday and begin their week-long comprehensive study of the Covid-19 situation in the district, steps taken by the district administration and suggest ways to strengthen ongoing measures to flatten the curve.

With seven new cases reported on Friday, the tally of Covid-19 cases in Kurnool district shot up to 547.

Two more fatalities were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the number of Covid-19 deaths in the district to 14.

Kurnool district, which continues on the top of Andhra Pradesh's chart, both in terms of highest number of cases as well as Covid-19 deaths, has remained a Covid-19 hot-spot for almost a month now and there seems to be no respite from the outbreak yet. 

On the brighter side, an 80 year old patient, a resident of Ganigalli locality in Kurnool city, recovered completely and was discharged from the Viswabharathi Covid hospital on Friday.
