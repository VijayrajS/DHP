Gujarat high court lambastes Civil hospital Ahmedabad for Covid-19 mess
2020-05-23
AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday gave a dressing down to the state government over the condition of the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad and said that the poor who come to the hospital are human beings and they must not be treated like animals. 

During the hearing of the suo motu PIL on the issue of Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, advocate Anand Yagnik raised the issue of the Civil hospital by terming it "a graveyard" and cited a letter written to the high court by Congress MLA Gyasuddin Shaikh requesting to direct the government to improve condition at the hospital. 

On hearing this, Justice J B Pardiwala of the division bench said, "The poorest of the poor are admitted in the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad. The poor people have a right to be treated well. They are human beings so treat them as human beings and do not give them a feeling that they are treated as animals."

When the lawyer cited TOI report about high fatalities in the Civil hospital, the judge said that they have been hearing about the Civil hospital, about people dying, patients' families not informed about death, junior doctors' plight, strike of the staff, patients not getting admitted and tests not being conducted. Justice Pardiwala added, "You have so many senior IAS officers deputed for Ahmedabad and only for the Civil hospital and yet your house is not in order." 

To this, the advocate general was quick, as usual, to give an assurance to the court that things would be in order within a week's time.
