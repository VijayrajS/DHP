IVRI working to develop vaccine for bovine coronavirus
2020-02-07
BAREILLY: As bovine coronavirus (bCov) affects cattle in India, scientists at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) are developing a vaccine for it. Scientists said the vaccine for bovine coronavirus is available in a few countries but importing it to India is both difficult and expensive. 

Bovine coronavirus is a livestock pathogen that causes diarrhoea in calves. Experts said the diarrhoea in calves can cause death and the disease impacts growth of cattle, leading to economic losses. The transmission of bovine coronavirus is through fecal-oral route. “It can be spread among calves if the infected calf contaminates the water, fodder or any utensil. The bovine coronavirus is prevalent across the country,” said an expert. 

RK Singh, director, IVRI, told TOI, “Bovine coronavirus, rotavirus, cryptosporidium, E.Coli are responsible for calf diarrhoea. We are developing a vaccine for bovine coronavirus, rotavirus, cryptosporidium, E.Coli and we have kept a target to make it within a year. Though the vaccine is available in a few countries, it is expensive and importing it is a cumbersome process. Besides, the vaccine developed here will be more effective on Indian pathogens. If a calf is vaccinated, it will get protection for nearly a year.”

Meanwhile, a national conference on “Challenges and threats of microbes to animals and humans” was held at IVRI on Thursday. Commenting on novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) which has spread from China, Gurdial Singh, vice-chancellor, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, said, “Novel coronavirus may have spread after consumption of wild bats. Unlike India, people in China consume raw meat and do not cook it properly.”
