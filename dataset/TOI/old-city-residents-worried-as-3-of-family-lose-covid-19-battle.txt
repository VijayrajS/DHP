2020-06-09
HYDERABAD: Residents of Old City have expressed concern over the surging Covid-19 cases after three people of the same family died of the disease in Shah Gunj. According to locals, the testing rates remain low among those returning from other states. 

“People coming from Karnataka and Maharashtra to the Old City are not being tested. We believe the authorities should be more alert and check everybody who crosses the border. They must also have information regarding the returnees,” said Khasim, a resident of Shahgunj. He added that people are scared of getting out of their houses as adequate sanitation measures are also not being taken.

Mohammed Shamin, a resident from Khurshid Jah Dewdi, told TOI that the locals had requested officials to restrict public movement where the infection was detected, but to no avail. “People are concerned about the surging Covid-19 cases and deaths reported in the locality. We are not satisfied with steps taken by the authorities and there is no one to check the public movement.”

“There is no check on eateries and markets where physical distancing is being violated. At this time, where government should stop people from venturing out, everyone is allowed to visit all places,” Younous, another resident of Old City, complained.

 Residents have demanded from state and GHMC to ensure proper sanitation and educating people about the virus. They also urged health department to conduct medical camps and distribute masks and sanitisers.
