AURANGABAD: A 60-year-old woman, who had contracted Covid-19 and was kept on ventilator for 11 days during her treatment, has recovered from the viral infection and was discharged from MGM hospital in Aurangabad on Thursday.

The woman, a resident of Begumpura area in Aurangabad city, was initially suffering from fever, cold and cough along with respiratory problems. Her son, a doctor, recognised the symptoms and got her tested for Covid-19. The woman also had high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes. 

Anand Nikalje, chief coordinator of the Covid care centre at MGM hospital, said that the woman was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit set up for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “The patient was having difficulty breathing, her blood sugar level had shot up and her oxygen level had dropped drastically. She was at a high risk due to old age and comorbid conditions. Apart from Covid-19, she was simultaneously being given treatment for her other ailments,” said Nikalje. 

Nikalje, along with his team of doctors Rohan Gundre, Prashant Akkulwar, Pradeep Taur, Yogesh Adki, successfully treated the woman under the guidance of dean of MGM Hospital and Medical College Rajesh Bohra, deputy dean Praveen Suryavanshi and medical superintendent H Raghavan.

Expressing confidence, Nikalje said that the doctors at the hospital would be able to cure the 25 other elderly patients undergoing treatment at the hospital.
