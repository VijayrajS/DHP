2020-03-09
BENGALURU: The Karnataka government late Sunday night ordered all government, aided and private schools in Bengaluru North, Bengaluru South and Bengaluru Rural educational districts to close nursery, LKG and UKG classes until further orders, in the wake of concerns over Covid-19 infections elsewhere in the country.


An education department official confirmed that oral instructions to this effect have been issued. Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar confirmed the holiday directive in a tweet.

Pankaj Pandey, commissioner, health and family welfare, in a missive to the education department, recommended the closure of nursery, LKG and UKG classes to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus and cited that the WHO had declared Covid-19 a global public health emergency.
