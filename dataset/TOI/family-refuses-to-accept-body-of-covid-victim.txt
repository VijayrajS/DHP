PALANPUR: Banaskantha health workers and hospital staff of Palanpur Civil Hospital were forced to perform the burial of a 65-year-old woman who succumbed to coronavirus infection on Monday.


Dr Jawahar Chandani, civil surgeon at the hospital, told TOI that the woman from Bhagal village, seven km from Palanpur, was brought here by her family members on April 23 and she tested positive the next day. Hers is the first death due to Covid-19 in Banaskantha.

Dr Chandani said that the hospital made several calls to her family members to take her body for last rites and burial. “We were aghast when they refused to claim the body and told us to perform her burial. They were just not willing to come and no amount of convincing helped.”

Banaskantha had registered 28 positive cases of Covid-19 of which one has died and a five-year-old boy discharged.
