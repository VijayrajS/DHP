2020-05-09
Poinguinim: Eight bars along the old Canacona highway, suspected to have been selling liquor during lockdown 2.0, from April 14 to May 3, have been sealed.

Canacona excise inspector Vishwas Kandolkar told TOI that the action was taken based on complaints received about the bars violating lockdown orders and selling liquor illegally.

Meanwhile, 10 liquor wholesale outlets and 12 packed bottle permit holder outlets, which had been sealed earlier, were unsealed following partial relaxation of the lockdown.

Kandolkar further said that across Canacona, 365 licences have been issued for retail sale of liquor and to operate bars, bar and restaurants and hotels. Also, 17 cashew distillery licences have so far been obtained by those interested in extracting cashew liquor.

The excise office will be maintaining a strict vigil to avoid any violations by these license holders, he said.
