2020-06-09
Amravati: A 50-year-old woman, who was being treated for SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illness) at Covid Hospital here, tested positive after her death on Monday morning.

Collector Shailesh Naval told TOI that the woman was shifted to Covid Hospital from Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial Medical College (PDMC) and Hospital 4-5 days ago and her swab was taken. She breathed her last during treatment early on Monday morning while her swab report came positive later.

With this, the Covid death count of the district has gone up to 17.

Besides the death, the city also reported five positive cases to take the district’s patient count to 284.

The two include a 36-year-old woman from Kishor Nagar who allegedly came in contact with a Getlife Hospital positive staffer. The other case is from Chawadi Chowk in Badnera where a 28-year-old youth tested positive. This is the second case from Chawadi Chowk after a 50-year-old woman, who had tested positive on Saturday last.

The Covid Hospital today discharged six patients. This has taken the number of recovered patients to 191. Now, the hospital has 74 active cases, including two in Nagpur.

‘Home isolation not feasible’: Meanwhile, Naval told TOI that implementation of new guidelines regarding home isolation are not feasible at this stage in Amravati and he would continue with the prevalent practice given the fact that most of the patients are slum-dwellers with very inadequate housing facilities. 

“If the situation warrants in future, we will take a decision,” he told TOI.
