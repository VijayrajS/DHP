NAVI MUMBAI: A cleric of Tablighi Jamaat, Markaz Nizamuddin, has appealed to Muslims in Taloja to cooperate with police by offering namaaz at home. He also appealed to those who have returned from the Delhi congregation to inform police about their attendance there. 

Senior inspector Kashinath Chavan said around 20% of the 3 lakh population were Muslims in Taloja. After several of those who went there tested positive for Covid-19, it was necessary to create awareness as some people were secretly performing namaaz in groups on building terraces, he said. "We requested Yasin Kasmi to appeal to the community members to not assemble at mosques or on their building terraces to offer namaaz, so as to maintain social distancing. The cleric agreed and has made a video of the appeal, which we have circulated to ensure that it reaches members of the community."

Chavan further said, "The cleric has even appealed to his community members who have returned from the Tablighi markaz in Delhi, to approach local police and civic administration. ." George Mendonca
