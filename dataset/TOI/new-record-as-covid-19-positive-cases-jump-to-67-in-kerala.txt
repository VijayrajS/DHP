2020-05-27
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan warned that Kerala is on the verge of a Covid-19 community spread and asked those in quarantine to obey rules and others to ensure social distancing in public places. Vijayan expressed his concern after several people misused lockdown relaxations. 


On Tuesday, 67 news cases were reported in state, the highest number of cases in a day. With this, 963 cases have been reported in Kerala till date, of which 415 patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals.

Kannur (85) has maximum active cases followed by Palakkad (81) and Malappuram (51). The number of people under observation once again crossed the one lakh mark to reach 1,04,336. Now, 1,03,528 are in home/institutional quarantine and 808 are admitted in designated isolation facilities. 

Of the 67 new cases, 29 are from Palakkad, eight from Kannur, six from Kottayam, five each from Ernakulam and Malappuram, four each from Kollam and Thrissur and three each from Alappuzha and Kasaragod.

Till date, 56,704 samples (including augmented samples) were sent for testing, of which 54,836 turned negative. Also, 8,599 samples were taken from priority groups like healthcare workers, persons with high social exposure, workers as part of sentinel surveillance and 8,174 samples tested negative.

The results of 10 patients were declared negative; two each from Ernakulam (one Palakkad native), Malappuram and Kasaragod and one each from Alappuzha, Kottayam, Palakkad and Kozhikode (one Malappuram native).

Vijayan said there was no evidence of community spread. "We are on the verge of community spread. More number of cases, reported in certain areas, is a matter of concern. Hence, we have to be more cautious. People should strictly follow the quarantine rules and not misuse lockdown relaxations," he said.

The government is strictly enforcing restrictions to prevent virus spread in the community. "We cannot stop people coming to their native place. Hence, those who are coming should have to go by the rules fixed by the government. If each and every NRK decide to come home, then the state will not be able to accommodate them. Hence only people who belong to priority groups should come now," he said. 

After May 7, 1,01,780 persons crossed the border and came home while 11,189 landed from abroad. Before May 7, there were only 16 active cases. Now, we have 415. The number of cases will increase in the coming days since several people have come from red zones, the CM said.

Among those who came from other states, 72 from Maharashtra tested positive apart from 71 who came from TN and 35 others who came from Karnataka. Also, 133 people who came from abroad tested positive.
