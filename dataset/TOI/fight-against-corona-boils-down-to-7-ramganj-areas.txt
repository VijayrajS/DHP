JAIPUR: The local administration has zeroed down its fight against coronavirus to seven areas with a population of 70,000 for the next few days. These areas have been barricaded with no movement of even civil groups providing essential supplies to the families.


The fortified areas are Jaganathji ka Rasta, Gosiyon ka Rasta, Panni Gram Moti Katla, Handipura Mohalla, Frutta Fura Ka Rasta and Faker Badshah ka Mohalla. These areas have been identified on the basis of number of Covid-19 positive cases. Every area has been sealed leaving one entry/exit point.

“Since the operation in the area has entered the third week has given access to a lot of data. These areas were listed by using probability formula, said area magistrate Aqeel Khan. The number of areas can be increased or decreased depending on the possible outcome.

The administration has not given any time frame for the existing situation but hinted that it will depend on number of cases from the sealed area.

Under the new protocol, the delivery of essential services including supply of milk, vegetables and food grains have become a challenging task given the congested living environment.

Many lanes are just two to four metre wide making impossible for the administration to send relief. The distribution is being done through pick-up vans which is accessible at limited places.

“We understand that ruthless containment is need of an hour and a very calculated measure by the authorities. My fear is they have not planned about the delivery of food as the majority of the area is low-income families,” said Naim Rabbani, a social activist living in Ramganj area.
