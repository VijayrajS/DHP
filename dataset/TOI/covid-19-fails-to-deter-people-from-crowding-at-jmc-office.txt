2020-03-18
JAIPUR: State government’s strict directions to tackle coronavirus seems to have fallen on deaf ears. on Tuesday, hundreds of people were seen at the birth and death registration office of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) queueing up to get the documents.

Though the government has issued directions that no gathering of more than 50 people would be allowed, neither people nor the authorities at JMC were bothered. A paper with the government’s instruction was pasted at the JMC office but people preferred to ignore it. 

At the office, people were seen standing in a queue waiting for their turn. While some were there for birth certificates, others lined up for death certificates.

Nasim Bano stood in a queue for 20 minutes before her turn came. “I know there is a threat of coronavirus but I have to get the birth certificate of my son for admission in school. If the situation was so bad, the government should not have allowed people to gather in such large numbers,” said Nasim. None of the guards and workers at JMC was seen wearing masks. People were busy arguing with each other and discussing with officers regarding the documents necessary to obtain the certificates. 

Additional commissioner of JMC Arun Garg, however, assured that they would look into the matter. “We will look into the matter and people will not be allowed inside the premises in large numbers. We are following the guidelines given by the government and will strictly enforce them very soon,” said Garg.
