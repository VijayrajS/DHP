Hyderabad: Madhapur police on Tuesday registered an FIR against a 20-year-old for moving around at Cyber Towers junction in his car despite being told to isolate himself at home. 

Pallipaga Rohan, who was studying in Australia, returned to Hyderabad five days ago. “Instead of undergoing home quarantine for 14 days, he was found moving out violating the norms of quarantine as prescribed by the health department,” said Cyberabad police. A case was booked under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Inidan Penal Code and relevant provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. 

According to cops, Rohan was found moving in the car with his parents at Cyber Towers junction and was caught during vehicle checking by police during the lockdown period. 

“As he was also found to be sick and coughing, he was shifted to Gandhi Hospital for further tests. Presently, he is in the isolation ward of Gandhi Hospital,” said a police officer.

According to police personnel, if Rohan tests positive, his family members would also be called for medical tests. They have been asked for strict adherence to home quarantine norms. 

Meanwhile, the Cyberabad police have appealed to those who have returned from foreign countries with Covid-19 symptoms to report to the authorities concerned immediately. “All foreign returnees should register voluntarily if they have not registered with the helpline number. Stringent legal action will be initiated against those violating norms,” said Cyberabad CP VC Sajjanar.
