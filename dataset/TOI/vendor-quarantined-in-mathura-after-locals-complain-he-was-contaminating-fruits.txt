Agra: A fruit vendor in Mathura was quarantined in a government facility on Monday after local residents complained that they saw him “licking” fruits from his cart. The man was taken to a hospital in Vrindavan for a Covid-19 test and will remain in quarantine in a facility there until his test results are out, said SP (city) Ashok K Meena. The SP said that no case has been filed against the 25 year old yet. “We will take action after ascertaining facts of the case,” he told TOI.Meanwhile, a video shot by a local resident showed the fruit seller, Bunty, son of Ajmeri (who only uses his first name), denying allegations. Another video showed a fruit seller nearby running away at the commotion.Residents, however, claimed that they saw Bunty licking fruits and when they confronted him, he tried to run away and fell down. He was taken away by police and medical staff. Earlier, a fruit seller in Madhya Pradesh's Raisen district was arrested on April 3 after the police authorities took cognisance of a viral video that showed him licking his fingers and touching fruits. Some media websites reported that the video dates back to February. Police have booked him under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC.
