BHOPAL: Aishbagh now has more Covid cases than Jehangirabad — the area which was termed the coronavirus hotspot of the state capital.

As of Monday morning, Aishbagh had 92 positive patients against 64 of Jehangirabad.

As per the police station-wise list of district administration, the areas under Hanumanganj police station come third with 57 positive patients followed by Mangalwara at 42.

Among new Bhopal areas, TT Nagar police station has 33 patients — the recent outbreak of infection in Ban Ganga slum area contributing much to the tally. Areas under Habibganj police station have just three patients, Shahpura two, Kolar three and MP Nagar only five.
