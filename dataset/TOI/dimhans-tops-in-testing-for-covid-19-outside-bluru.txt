Dimhans tops in testing for Covid-19 outside B’luru
2020-06-03
Hubballi: The Covid 19 Lab set up at Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Dimhans) from April 21, has emerged as the 6th top lab in the state by testing 585 samples in the week that ended on June 1. 

The top five laboratories are in Bengaluru, and Dimhans is considered the top most in average testing of samples in the rest of Karnataka. The list was released by the state Covid -19 testing team on Monday.

Dimhans has surpassed bigger labs of Mysore Medical College Mysuru (testing capacity of 350 samples per day), KIMS Hubballi (250), HIMS Hassan (250), National Center for Biological Sciences (250) and Wenlock VRDL Lab (240) though it has the capacity to test 100 samples per day. It has also done better than 20 private laboratories in the state.

Speaking to TOI, Dimhans director Dr Mahesh Desai said, "We have 14 staff members including three microbiologists who work for one shift. However, our team is working two shifts i.e. 16 hours a day. With cases spiralling due to the return of migrants, the district administration told us to increase the testing capacity. Our team even sacrificed holidays and made good use of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) and RNA Extractor." 

DC Deepa Cholan appreciated the efforts of Dimhans authorities and said she will depute the required staff from the health department soon. "It’s a pride for the district that our lab has emerged in the top 6 in the state," she said.
