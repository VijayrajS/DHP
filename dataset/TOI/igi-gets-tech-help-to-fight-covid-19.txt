IGI gets tech help to fight Covid-19
2020-05-12
NEW DELHI: On National Technology Day, the Delhi airport introduced several devices that will be crucial in fighting novel coronavirus, especially when commercial passenger flights resume operations. 


Some of these innovative devices, which are aimed at cutting down on human contacts, are a sanitising baggage and trolley tunnel, sensor-based taps in passenger washrooms, foot-operated sanitiser dispensers, and sensor-based and paddle-operated drinking water fountains.

While the disinfection tunnel uses ultraviolet (UV) rays to disinfect surfaces of luggage and used trolleys, walk-in shoe mats are soaked with chemical that will sanitise the shoes of the passengers, said an official of the Indira Gandhi International Airport.

“The baggage, used trolleys and trays can be passed through a tunnel one after another, and each of them will take approximately five seconds to come out virus-free,” the official added. The sanitising tunnel has been installed in the baggage belt area of IGIA’s Terminal 3. 

There are also mobile disinfecting towers to keep the entire premises clean and safe. These towers use UV lamps for disinfection in a cordoned-off area and can be manually re-located once an area is disinfected. Hand-held torches will be used to disinfect desks, laptops and other devices.

Since the beginning of the nationwide novel coronavirus lockdown in March end, commercial passenger flight operations have been suspended. The commercial operations will initially resume at T3.
