LUCKNOW: Get up before sunrise to boost your immunity, do at least half an hour yoga, take a walk on terrace or inside the house and eat light meals as your physical activity has slowed down due to the lockdown. These are basic Ayurveda tools to stay happy and healthy at times like these. Also add to it an adequate sleep and lukewarm water to satiate your thirst throughout the day.




In the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, the ministry of ayush has issued an advisory on boosting immunity and self care, with special reference to respiratory health. The recommendations are “supported by Ayurvedic literature and scientific publications.”

The advisory said, “While there is no medicine for Covid-19 as of now, it will be good to take preventive measures which boost our immunity.” “We should have more protein and minimum carbohydrates in our daily diest these days. Eat less as physical activity is also less,” said Dr Shiv Shankar Tripathi, MD, Ayurveda. He said that getting up before sunrise and doing a half-an-hour workout will improve health. Workout during the daytime will have little or no effect.

Also, special care has to be taken of the digestive system. Stomach upsets have to be avoided. “Dinner should be done by eight in the night,” said Dr Tripathi, former medical officer incharge (Ayurveda), Raj Bhawan. Diet should have a lot of fibre content also and 'munakka' (raisin) is a good natural source of it. Jaggery also improves digestion.

Special care has to be taken of the respiratory tract. ‘Giloy’, tulsi, ajwain, haldi, dalchini, gur, garlic and kaali mirch help boost immunity.
