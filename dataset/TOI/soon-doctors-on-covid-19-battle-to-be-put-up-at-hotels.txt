HYDERABAD: Doctors treating coronavirus patients may soon get relief as the state government is contemplating providing them accommodation in nearby hotels on the lines of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s move. The Delhi administration has been putting up doctors fighting the Covid-19 in hotels to overcome travel issues and maintain social distancing norms.


Telangana heath department has announced that all doctors working in hospitals where Covid-19 positive patients were being treated or isolation facilites would have to be in five-day home quarantine after an equal number of days of work. Many doctors, including residents, were facing difficulties and expressed concerns that if they go home after treating the patients, their families might be at risk of infection.

Many medical staff were also under pressure from house owners. “In view of all these issues, the government has in principle decided that doctors will be given hotel accommodation, for self quarantine,” a source said. A high-level committee has even been constituted to work out the modalities involved. 

The government is also working on providing doctors and support staff with transport facilities. An application would be created to identify their pick-up location and they will be dropped at their respective health facilities in vehicles arranged by the government.

The state government has already announced incentives for the medical staff and also full salary. Currently, nearly 1,000 medical staff are working in the state-run health facilities in the city. 

Personnel from general medicine and pulmonology specialities are working full steam as they were involved 24X7 in the fight against Covid-19
