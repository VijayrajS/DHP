Coronavirus: Coaching institutes in Nagpur to shut down
2020-03-15
NAGPUR: Following government’s directives to shut down all schools and colleges in Maharashtra till March 31, the Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) has announced that its members will abide with the decision with immediate effect. 

The shutdown had been proposed earlier in the day by the health department to prevent spread of coronavirus infection. The education department endorsed the proposal and issued notification late in the evening on Saturday. 

Speaking to TOI, ACI’s office-bearer Sameer Phale said, “In the interest of the students and as directed by the state government, all of our member institutes will shut down.” 

ACI is a Nagpur-based body which has been providing a platform to coaching institutes to address concerns over proposed regulatory moves. ACI has also moved on to peer interaction and training programmes for its members.

Shortly before the state government announced its decision to shut all educational institutes, ACI had issued a media statement saying they have requested Indian Medical Association (Nagpur) members to visit their classes and create awareness about coronavirus.
