IITR, Lucknow startup develop tech to disinfect PPE, N95 masks for reuse
2020-06-15
LUCKNOW: The Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), in association with a Lucknow-based startup has indigenously developed ‘OptiMaser’ – a microwave-based disinfection system which can make personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 masks reusable.

“The technology has the capability to disinfect PPE kits and N95 masks within 10 minutes. It has been tested by the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, and has received positive reviews. We have filed for a joint patent of the technology,” said IITR director Prof Alok Dhawan.

“This is the first-of-its-kind technology in the country and the machine can come in handy at a time when safety gears are required at a large scale due to Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.

“The equipment will help in saving cost of new PPE kits and masks and also save environment as bio-medical waste will be reduced. We will send it to Small Arms Factory, Kanpur, for further testing,” he added.

The equipment comes with a bucket and a revolving plate in which as many as 25 PPE kits can be placed at a time for disinfection.

Executive director, Maser Technology Pvt Ltd, Monish Bhandari said: “The equipment has 10-times amplified strength as compared to normal microwave and doesn’t melt plastic or deteriorates cloth material as disinfection requires a temperature of 60-70 degress Celsius. It does not require heavy power connection and can be run even in households.”

Director, AIIMS, Jodhpur, Prof Sanjeev Misra said, “We got positive results in a series of tests done since April to see whether microwave can disinfect PPEs and N95. The machine can be effective in areas of low-risk exposures.”
