Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government has identified and quarantined 107 people from the state — and at least 20 foreigners — who attended Delhi’s Tablighi Jamaat Markiz in the past month. The authorities are looking for two more MP residents.

Thirty-one of them are from Bhopal. They and the 20 foreigners — apparently from Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia — have been identified and screened in the city for Covid-19, say officials. Swab samples have been collected for tests, said Bhopal collector Tarun Pithode.

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has instructed officials to track and quarantine those who may have come in contact with them. “We have learnt that more than 100 people from Madhya Pradesh had participated in the religious gathering. We need to be alert and vigilant. All these people should be identified, screened and quarantined,” Chouhan said at a review meeting on Covid-19 on Tuesday. “This action is in everyone's interest. All superintendents of police (SPs) have been instructed to take quick action in the regard,” the CM said.

Names, addresses and phone numbers of the 31 Bhopalis have been handed over to DIG by the state’s intelligence unit.
