Coimbatore: In view of spread of Covid-19 disease, the school education department took precautionary measures at the Class XII examination centres in the district on Friday.

The exam was held in 116 centres for regular students and three centres for private candidates.

All the examination centres were sanitized with the help of workers from the office of deputy director of health service, chief educational officer P Usha said. “Students as well as teachers were asked to wash their hands using soaps before entering the exam halls. We instructed students to approach the government hospital if they found symptoms like cold and fever. Flying squads and standing squads would ensure that the precautionary measures are followed in the schools,” she said.

Of the 34,273 students who were enrolled for the examination, 887 were absent. “As only two examinations are pending, the tensed situation in the wake of Covid-19 does not have any impact on them. The students just want to get over it,” said a government schoolteacher. “Only Class X students and teachers are affected because of the situation. Ideally, students will have revision tests till a day before the examination. Now, that the government has asked the schools to shut down, the students have no other option but to study on their own without teachers’ guidance.”
