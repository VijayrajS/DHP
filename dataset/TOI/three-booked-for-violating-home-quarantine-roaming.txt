2020-03-21
AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: In a bid to send a stern message to not mess with public health priorities, Gujarat health authorities filed police cases against three persons — one in Ahmedabad and two in Vadodara — for violating home quarantine orders. Meanwhile, the state government also appointed inspector general of police Hare Krishna Patel as nodal officer to ensure police foil any attempt to violate isolation orders.

In a first, a man in Ahmedabad who had returned from Singapore on March 14 and was advised home isolation was booked by Odhav police after a surprise check found him to be out attending a funeral! 

The man was charged under IPC Section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life carrying up to two years jail), Section 188 (disobeying order passed by public servant carrying up to six months jail) and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 Section 3 (disobeying order made under this act). All the three offences are bailable. 

Inspector R G Jadeja of Odhav police station said the man was removed from the funeral, taken into custody and handed over to health officers of the AMC. Two men in Vadodara under home quarantine were booked under Section 144 (violating prohibitory orders) for moving around in the city despite being ordered isolation. 

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) registered cases against the two after surprise checks revealed they were not at home. 

There are nearly 4,000 people in quarantine all over the state of which 80% are home quarantined. 

Principal health secretary Jayanti Ravi said no violation of quarantine by people with international travel history will be tolerated. “The government will not shy away from invoking penal provisions against those violating quarantine. We also urge neighbours and society to call out any such violations,” said Ravi.
