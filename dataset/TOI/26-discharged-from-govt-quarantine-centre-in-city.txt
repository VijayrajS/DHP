BHUBANESWAR: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday asked 26 people staying in a government quarantine centre to leave the facility after completion of the mandatory 14-day period. None of the discharged tested positive for novel coronavirus.


Among those discharged are the ones who had returned from abroad and had travelled to places outside Odisha. There were also Kar Clinic staff and kin of the Covid-19 patient who was being treated in the clinic before he tested positive, leading to the clinic being sealed. The health department on Thursday confirmed that 21 samples of Kara Clinic staff and those close to the patient had tested negative.

A BMC officer said blood sample of all the 26 had been taken for tests and they were found to be negative. “Although it is not mandatory that all discharged from quarantine needs to undergo test, yet it was done as it was the first batch. None of the 26 showed symptoms during their stay in quarantine home. They were all contact persons and suspects,” said a BMC officer in charge of the quarantine facility.

All the discharged were staying in a government hostel. The government has another facility in the city, a guest house. Together, the facilities can house more than 500 people. As of Friday, 54 are in government quarantine.

BMC officials said those who come in contact with a positive person or could come in contact if allowed to stay in a locality, are taken to the quarantine facility. Also, the ones who are suspected to have come in contact with a positive person but don’t have enough facility for home quarantine, have been taken to the government centre. The BMC has been supplying food and other essential items for the quarantined.
