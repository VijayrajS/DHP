MUMBAI: Away from family, friends and besieged by information about a raging new virus, this Kalyan man (36) spent this past week in isolation at Kasturba Hospital, Chinchpokli, for suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV). 


 
 

Speaking to TOI following his discharge on Thursday, the father of two said he was relieved to have not carried the infection home. 

The sales executive and his 31-year-old female colleague from Nalasopara, who had both travelled to China for work, were the first from the city to be isolated at Kasturba on January 23. He had volunteered to meet local doctors after his cold and cough persisted for 24 hours on his return from China’s Guangzhou where he spent six days. 

“There were moments of euphoria, panic and frustration in the last seven days (of quarantine). The fact that little is known about the virus and how to treat it scared us. We were constantly reading about cases and deaths in China on our phones. When the first report came negative, I was filled with relief and excitement,” he said, adding that staying in touch with loved ones helped him cope with the isolation. The authorities then decided to carry out the second round of tests. “However, they refused to discharge us even after the second test reports arrived on January 28... We got frustrated and anxious.” 

The Kalyan man recalled that everything was normal when they landed in China on January 16. “By the time we returned, though, things had changed. The Wuhan outbreak had become big. The airport was teeming with people in masks,” he said. “The temperature there was 10 degrees and I had a cold” 

He said nurses checked on them at least three times a day donning protective gear. “Quality of food was alright but there is room for improvement in cleaning of dishes. The rooms were cleaned multiple times in a day,” he said. “I would urge all with symptoms to seek medical advice.”
