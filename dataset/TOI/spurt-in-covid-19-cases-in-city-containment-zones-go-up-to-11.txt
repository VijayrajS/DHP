2020-05-03
Visakhapatnam: Four new Covid-19 cases in Visakhapatnam over the last two days have sent alarm bells ringing. The number of containment zones has gone up to 11 covering most parts under the ambit of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC).

Many parts of Visakhapatnam west, the old city, including the administrative and health zone of Maharanipeta has come under the scanner. The district administration is taking measures to ensure that a 3km-perimetre of the area is sealed in Maharanipeta and Gopalapatnam.

Speaking to STOI, Visakhapatnam district collector V Vinay Chand said, “Taking cognisance of the rise in number of cases in the city and the directives issued by the Union government, we have increased the number of containment zones within GVMC limits.”

The district collector said that vehicular movement will be restricted in containment zones and there will be single entry and exit points in these zones. “Essential goods and medical facilities will be available,” Chand added.

Upon being asked if the administration is gearing up for a complete lockdown of the city, the collector explained that many of the containment zones are in the core city. However, norms will be relaxed in areas which had been declared containment zones earlier if they don’t report any cases in 28 days.

The collector however maintained that this is a dynamic arrangement and decisions will be taken on the basis of occurrence of cases. The district administration seems to be in no mood to take chances and made it clear that surveillance of residents in containment zones will go on unabated.
