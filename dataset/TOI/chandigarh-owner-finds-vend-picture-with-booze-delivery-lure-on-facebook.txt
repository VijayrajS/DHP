CHANDIGARH: A liquor vend owner in Sector 22 has filed a complaint with the police that his name and pictures of his vend had been posted on social media for home delivery of booze. 

Gulshan Kumar, the complainant, said his friends had told him that some miscreants had put up his shop's pictures on Facebook and other websites a few days back. When he checked, he found that a message stating that people could call for home delivery of liquor had been posted with a mobile number. 

Kumar approached the operation cell of the Chandigarh Police. When cops dialled the number, a man answered. The cop demanded two liquor bottles. The fraudster told him to make payment through UPI before delivery. The cop tried to persuade him for cash on delivery but the fraudster did not relent. The cop then revealed his identity, leading to the fraudster disconnecting the phone. His mobile was later found switched off, Kumar said.

Later, Kumar received a call from the excise and taxation department after its officials noticed the message. They advised Kumar to file an official complaint. Kumar said he then lodged a complaint against unknown person at the SSP public window. The matter was forwarded to cyber cell for further investigation. No arrests have been made so far.

 Kumar said the accused later switched on his mobile number and added one more mobile number with the picture of his liquor vend. The cyber cell found that one SIM card was registered in the name of Mahavir Singh, a resident of Etawah in Uttar Pradesh.
