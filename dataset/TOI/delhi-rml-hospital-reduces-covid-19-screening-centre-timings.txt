Delhi: RML Hospital reduces Covid-19 screening centre timings
2020-06-07
NEW DELHI: Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital will run the screening centre for Covid-19 patients for a reduced duration from Sunday to not "keep test results pending", a hospital official said, days after Delhi government alleged that the Centre-run facility was giving out "erroneous" test results and delaying reports. 

"It has been decided that the screening centre for Covid-19 will function from 9am to 5pm with effect from June 7," read the order signed by Dr Minakshi Bharadwaj, medical superintendent of RML, and issued on Saturday. 

 Earlier the hospital operated the screening centre round-the-clock. An official said the hospital was receiving more samples than its testing capacity. The reduced timings, the administration hoped, would bring down the load. "Over the last one week, we have been receiving over 400 samples and, in fact, in the last two days sample collection crossed over 500 while our testing capacity is of 300-350 samples per day. 

"We don't want to keep the test results pending and have thus reduced the screening centre timings. The screening facility has been functioning for 24 hours since February 1," the hospital official claimed.

On Wednesday, the Aam Aadmi Party government alleged the hospital was giving out "erroneous" Covid-19 test results and violating government norms of submitting them within 48 hours. 

The hospital has maintained that there was no backlog any more and regular quality checks were being done. 

By Friday, novel coronavirus cases in Delhi had crossed the 26,000-mark and the death toll jumped to 708, according to the state government.
