Don’t target us if someone tests Covid-19 +ve after we reopen: Schools’ body
2020-06-13
Dehradun: A body representing several private schools in the state has urged the government to give them the assurance that schools won’t be targeted (or penalised) if one of their students or staff members test Covid-19 positive after the schools reopen.

Prem Kashyap, state president of Principals Progressive Schools Association, said, “The schools are probably going to reopen from mid-July. However, we have decided that we will only reopen after both — the parents and the state government — are willing to allow children to schools. We don’t want to be targeted if some student or staff member tests Covid-19 positive in the future. We want an assurance from the state government before the reopening of schools. We have even sent a letter to them in this regard."
