Hyderabad: 50 Niloufer Hospital staff quarantined
2020-04-20
HYDERABAD: After a two-month-old baby tested positive for Covid-19 at Niloufer Hospital, 50 medical staff were asked to go into quarantine. The superintendent of the hospital has issued a circular asking the medical staff who were on duty on April 16 and 17 to quarantine themselves. 

 

However, a few hours after the circular, hospital authorities issued a second circular stating that the hospital staff has been asked to stay in quarantine as part of the regular roster system. The circular also stated there were no cases of Covid-19 in the hospital. 

Currently all hospitals in the state have been asked to follow a system, wherein medical staff have to quarantine themselves for five days after 10-day working period.

The two-month-old baby from Mahbubnagar had tested positive for coronavirus on April 17. The baby was admitted to Niloufer hospital with respiratory issues. The infant’s parents were daily-wage workers. 

Sources at the hospital said that nearly 50 medical personnel, including doctors, have been placed under quarantine. However, the hospital management stated in its second circular that the staff was being quarantined as part of routine orders and that all members worked with masks as well as personal protection equipment.

In the current scenario, doctors at the hospital said that it was important to limit the number of family members accompanying pregnant women. 

“There has to be some restriction on the number as we would not know who the silent carriers of the virus could be,” a doctor said. 

A debate regarding number of quarantine days for medical staff has gained traction among members of the health community. Many want a 14-day quarantine and a 7-day work system followed in states like Uttar Pradesh, compared to the 5-day quarantine practised here. In another instance, a nurse was admitted to King Koti hospital after her test results came up positive for Covid-19 at Nims.
