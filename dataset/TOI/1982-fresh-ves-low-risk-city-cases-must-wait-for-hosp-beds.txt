Covid-19: 1,982 fresh positive cases in Tamil Nadu; low-risk Chennai cases must wait for hospital beds
2020-06-13
CHENNAI: Hospitals in Chennai have begun to put low-risk patients on the waitlist for admission as Covid-19 infections surged unchecked. The city recorded 1,479 of the 1,982 fresh cases in Tamil Nadu on Friday, taking the state’s tally past 40,000. Eighteen deaths, too, were reported.


The doubling period — time taken for infections to double — is now 14 days for Tamil Nadu and 13 days for Chennai. Of the 18,281 active cases in the state, Chennai is treating 13,906 and hospitals are stretched.

Of the four main government hospitals, the 450-bed Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital only handles moderate and severe Covid-19 patients. Stanley and Kilpauk medical colleges each has around 400 beds and most are occupied. Each also monitors 1,200 patients in home quarantine. The 500-bed Omandurar hospital has nearly 400 in-patients and is responsible for 1,500 in home quarantine.

The patients have been told to call doctors in case of emergency. “They sign an undertaking assuring us that they have facilities to support home quarantine and that they will come if there is an emergency. Local health authorities also visit them to inquire on their health condition,” said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu. 


Spreading at lightning speed in city, more virulent: Minister

“If they can’t afford home isolation, we send them to Covid care centres or health centres,” he said.

“All asymptomatic patients, including those with comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are asked to stay at home,” said Apollo Hospitals infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian. Earlier, government had advised that people with diabetes and hypertension must stay in hospitals.

Now, they use a pulse oxymeter – clip worn on the fingertips to measure oxygen levels – and return to the hospital if the oxygen levels dip below 94% or if they feel discomfort, he said. “Most people are in step-down units where they are administered oxygen or admitted to high dependency units. We have cut down on luxury of independent rooms because we neither have that many staff nor rooms,” Ramasubramanian said about the situation in some private hospitals.

Several private hospitals asked patients with chronic renal failure or respiratory disorder to go to government hospitals. “We can’t offer dialysis because there are several others in the room and sanitation may affect services,” said a nephrologist at a private hospital.

At least 25 exclusive Covid care ambulances have been brought from districts to Chennai. “We are shifting more patients from homes to hospitals and from hospitals to covid care centres within the city. Every ambulance makes at least eight trips a day,” said 108-EMRI head Selva Kumar. The fleet now has 80 exclusive Covid care ambulances for the city. 

Health minister C Vijayabaskar again said the infection was spreading at lightning speed in Chennai and was more virulent in the last few days. Since June 1, the state has added 18,375 cases to the tally – which is almost 45% of the total cases reported in the state. Analysis by TOI, based on government bulletins showed that it took 69 days for the state to touch 10,000 cases on May 15, since it reported its first case on March 7. Two weeks later, it topped 10,000 more cases to reach a tally of 20,246 on May 29 and in another eight days, it reached 30,152. Since then, it has taken just six days to add another 10,000 to reach 40,698 cases.

As there is no exit test, the number of people getting out of the hospitals and isolation also steadily increased. On Friday, 1,342 patients were discharged and the number of people cured rose to 22,047 in TN.

Chennai’s neighbours – Chengalpattu (128), Kancheepuram (26) and Tiruvallur (92) -- together logged 246 cases. Barring six districts – Erode, Nilgiris, Krishnagiri, Salem, Tirupur and Tirupattur – all other districts shared the remaining 246 cases. While Madurai reported 31 cases, Tiruvanammalai had 22 and Sivaganga had 12.

A 38-year-old patients admitted with fever, cough and difficulty in breathing on May 30 died at a private hospital on Thursday. Ten of the 18 deaths happened among people above the age of 60. The official toll of 367 does not include 236 deaths in Chennai. Health officials were still poring through death records sent by the Greater Chennai Corporation for reconciliation. “We will revise the toll by the weekend,” a senior member in the committee said.
