PUNE: Sixty-eight-year old retired district judge R M Khan felt a discomfort in his throat and developed cough on May 19. The following day he and his 69-year-old wife tested positive for Covid-19 and were admitted to a private hospital. 

Though his wife did not have any pre-existing health issues, Khan had comorbid conditions, including diabetes and high blood pressure. After 10 days of treatment, the couple recovered and were discharged on Thursday.

On being asked how he had reacted to the news of testing positive, he said, “I have been a district judge and have never been scared of anything. I accepted the result and did what had to be done. My wife was there to support me, and I supported her through this difficult time.”

Looking back at how he could have contracted the virus, he said, “I don’t know how we got infected. We have been home since the last two months. We did not go out and people did not visit us. We have been avoiding all contact.”

He added that the doctors and staffers at the hospital were very professional and efficient. “The treatment was good. There were many doctors who were working together as a team to help patients recover from the virus. I did a lot of yoga and walking while I was in the hospital. It helped me keep my mind stress-free,” he said, adding that the physical exercise helped him keep his sugar level in control. 

After returning home from hospital, Khan said his sugar levels, which were above 200 at the time of testing positive, have been under control and so was his blood pressure. “I feel absolutely fine now,” he said.
