PUNE: The district administration has decided to utilize private ambulances anticipating the need for a larger number of such vehicles following the spurt in the Covid-19 cases.

This comes at a time when around 60% of private ambulances went off roads in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad due to lack of equipment and drivers’ fear of contacting Covid-19. 



“Due to spread of Covid-19, there may be a need for a large number of ambulances. All private ambulances in the entire district are being empanelled and will be pressed into service as and when required,” read the notice signed by deputy collector Neeta Sawant Shinde.

“You will be contacted and the ambulance must be made available without any delay. Till you receive call for empanelment, you must continue to use the ambulance for prescribed purposes,” it added.

Gopal Jhambe, secretary of Pune Ambulance Owners’ Association, said, “Only 30-35% of private ambulances are plying in Pune. Few drivers are willing to risk taking patients. We cannot afford PPEs. The association met mayor Murlidhar Mohol in March on the issue.”

Sanket Shah, a resident of Timber Market and member of Divine Jain Group that works with the charity commissioner, said, “I recently got a call about a lady losing consciousness on the road and frothing at the mouth. On reaching there, I found people standing. They were scared to touch her. I alerted police and three hours went in arranging an ambulance.”

 Ramesh Ranka of Ranka Hospital said, “Most drivers said they were scared to ply to hospitals, such as Naidu, Sassoon, Bharati, treating Covid-19 patients.”
