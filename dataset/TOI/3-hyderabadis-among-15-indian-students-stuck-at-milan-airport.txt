HYDERABAD: As many as 15 Indian students, including three from Hyderabad, are stuck at Milan’s Malpensa airport as authorities have asked for medical certificates to prove that they are not afflicted by coronavirus.

As of Wednesday evening, the students had already spent 36 hours at the airport.

Helpline numbers at the airport have been of no help as local doctors have asked them to contact the Indian embassy to get the test done.

“We are unable to get the test done and are getting no help from anywhere,” said Donta Teja Sree, who had gone to Italy to pursue her masters in biotechnology. The Air India flight took off without them though they had been booked on it on Tuesday. 

Having nowhere to go, the students spent the night at the airport and are still there. “But airport authorities are asking us to leave saying that the flight we had been booked on has departed,” Dontha Teja Sree told TOI over the phone. Her parents live at Miyapur in Hyderabad. On Tuesday, there were as many as 50 Indian students at the airport. Some of them left to the houses of friends or relatives. The 15 who stayed back have nowhere to go. The students said they are hungry as there is no food available at the food courts. 

The Indian embassy in Italy initially told them that arrangements for accommodation will be made, but later asked them to organise it with an assurance that they will be reimbursed. The students, however, said that since the entire city was in lock down, like the rest of Italy, they could not venture out.
