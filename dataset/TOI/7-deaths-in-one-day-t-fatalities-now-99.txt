HYDERABAD: Telangana reported seven deaths from novel coronavirus on Wednesday, the highest single-day toll since the outbreak as 129 more persons tested positive for the deadly virus. Total cases in state stand at 3,020 and death toll is 99.

Health authorities said they are worried at the rising number of Covid-19 cases with many hospitals reporting serious cases. “The number of deaths is the highest so far and the number of patients on ICU support has been on the rise. Currently, over 170 patients are on ICU support across various designated Covid-19 hospitals. There is a rise in serious cases too,” said a senior official from the state health department.

Of the new cases recorded on Wednesday, 108 were from Greater Hyderabad, while the other cases were reported from Ranga Reddy, Asifabad, Medchal, Sircilla, Yadadri, Kamareddy and Mahbubnagar districts.

Five patients given plasma therapy, show improvement

Going by the latest count, 1,556 people have so far recovered from the Covid-19 virus, while 1,365 others are now under treatment across the state.

Five critical patients who were taken up for plasma transfusion therapy have shown considerable improvement and one has completely recovered and been discharged.

“As part of ICMR clinical trial, five patients from Telangana with patient ID - P1311, P1459, P1647, P2415, and P2639 were given plasma transfusion at Gandhi hospital, Hyderabad. All mandatory protocols set by ICMR were duly followed during the therapy. The therapy was introduced to the patients when their oxygen saturation levels dropped below 84%-90%,” an official statement from the state health department said.

Two transfusions were given to each of the five patients. After the completion of therapy, all the five patients reported clinical improvement.

“P1311 has already been discharged, 3 are no longer oxygen-dependent and P1647 is under intermittent dependency,” he said.
