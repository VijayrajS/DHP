2020-04-02
Bareilly: A doctor posted at a primary health centre in Dhaurahra tehsil of Lakhimpur Kheri district has “resigned”, citing that he has “contracted Covid-19”. Calling him a “black ship”, Lakhimpur Kheri chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Manoj Agarwal accused the doctor of “shirking from his responsibility in this hour of crisis”.

“If he is infected, his samples could have been sent for test, but he didn’t ask for it,” said the CMO.

“So far, one Covid-19 positive has been reported in Lakhimpur Kheri district, and the patient is being treated in Sitapur and Lucknow,” said the CMO.

In his resignation letter to the CMO, Dr Neelesh Kumar Maurya, who was posted at the PHC in Ranjeetganj, stated that he had examined nearly 60 migrant labourers on March 30 without following personal safety guidelines due to limited facilities available at the centre, and thus, he developed Covid-19 symptoms. He did not want to infect anyone else, so he was quarantining himself, wrote Dr Maurya, adding that he “won’t be able to continue his services as a medical officer, hence I’m resigning from my post”.

The CMO told TOI, “Dr Maurya is only trying to shirk from his responsibilities, as he knows it very well that the CMO is not a competent authority to accept resignation. He had dodged his responsibilities as a medical officer in the past as well. Ideally, he should have contacted us and we would have sent his samples for the Covid-19 test. But, he didn’t contact us and left the PHC vacant without a notice.”

“We are working to prove safety kits to all medical staff deployed in the district,” added the CMO.
