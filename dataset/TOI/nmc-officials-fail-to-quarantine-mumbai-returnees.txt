NMC officials fail to quarantine Mumbai returnees

Nagpur: On one hand, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe is mass quarantining people from containment zones but on the other, his health officials are not even testing people who have returned from other cities. This despite the returnees willingly informing the NMC about their journey.

Manish Kubde, a resident of Dighori, had gone to Mumbai to pick up his stranded sister. He had obtained a travel pass following the stipulated procedure. He returned to the city on Monday morning.

On returning home, Kubde immediately rang up NMC’s helpline and informed the staffer about his journey. “The staffer told me that NMC was overburdened and hence, could not send staffers to my home. They asked me to go to KDK College Hospital. When I went there with my sister, the hospital authorities told me that their quota for the day was full and I should come on Tuesday morning. When I went there on Tuesday morning, the authorities asked me to come in the afternoon,” he said.

“Frustrated over the dilly-dallying, I again rang up NMC healthline and police. NMC told me that they would send somebody soon. The police department sent two cops, who just noted the details of my journey. Till Tuesday night, nobody from NMC had turned up,” said Kubde.

When TOI contacted NMC health officer Dr Vijay Joshi, he said that if Kubde had been tested in Mumbai, there was no need for him to get tested here again. “We test returnees as neighbours lodge complain with us in such cases,” added Joshi.

Kubde, however, said that he had not been tested at Mumbai. “They only checked my temperature and let me go. The government does not seem to be serious about lockdown,” he added.

Kubde further said that although he crossed several districts before reaching Mumbai and also on his way back, nobody stopped him at district boundaries. The state government has banned inter-district travel without a valid pass.
