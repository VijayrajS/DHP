Ahmedabad: Police create sanitization van for personnel on lockdown duty
2020-04-13
AHMEDABAD: With a constable of Kalupur police station testing positive for Covid-19, the city police have come up with an innovative idea to quickly and thoroughly sanitize their personnel. Special police commissioner, crime branch, Ajay Tomar said that they have made a sanitization van in which a policeman has to sit for just half a minute and his whole body, including garments, will get sanitized.

Tomar said they acted on representations from policemen and officers working in Covid-19 affected or cluster-quarantine areas to sanitize their entire bodies, uniform, shoes and belts. “They had said that if they go home without sanitization, they may take the vicious virus home and put their family in risk,” Tomar said.

He added that they contacted Dr Vineet Mishra of IKDRC and with his help they prepared a mix of methyl alcohol and two binding agents.

 “This mix is filled in the tank on the top of the van. A policeman just has to sit in the van for half a minute and the fumes sanitize his whole body,” Tomar said.

He said two more such vans are being built. “This van will be deployed in vulnerable areas to sanitize personnel and keep them safe.”

Police sources said the current sanitization van moves around in quarantined and vulnerable areas. “This will make our force and their families safe. It needed to be done as the police is fighting a big war against the virus and we need our personnel to be fit,” Tomar said.
