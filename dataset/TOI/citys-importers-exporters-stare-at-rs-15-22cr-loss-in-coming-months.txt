Coronavirus scare in Kochi: Importers and exporters stare at Rs 15-22 crore loss in coming months
2020-03-13
KOCHI: As Covid-19 is disrupting the routine life of Malayalis and driving down the footfalls in local shops, away from the public eye, there is a serious crisis going to hit Kochi’s economy as the import-export business through Cochin Port has been severely affected due to the ongoing global pandemic. 


The import of commodities and goods from across the world through the port during January 2019 was 9,963 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units, that is, the unit of the capacity of a container ship), but came down to 8,684 TEUs in January 2020. Further, it came down to below 7,000 TEUs during February 2020. 

The current decline in imports through the Cochin Port and the expected fall in exports during the coming months will result in a loss of business of $2-3 million (Rs 15-22 crore) to exporters and importers (exim community) of Kochi, says the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI). 

“Exports haven’t been affected so far but it will be affected during the next month or so. The Kuwait port is already closed and Bahrain will be closed soon. As most of our exports are to the Middle East, it is going to affect us,” said V Venugopal, president, CCCI. 

Venugopal said the decline in imports is troubling as it is going to affect exports also. “Imports and exports are inter-linked. Unless containers from outside reach Kochi, we won’t be able to export from here. For example, there might be some thousand empty containers sitting in Dubai, which you couldn’t bring over here to export our products, because it will be an additional cost and such actions wouldn’t sustain in a competitive market,” he said. 

In fact, ports have started facing container shortages and freight rates have been going up. The surplus containers for the trade comes from China.

“The major area to be affected in the current crisis is China and two thirds of our imports through Cochin Port are from that country. We know that Chinese imports are not going to come during the next month also. So, you may have goods to export and there might be demand also, but you will not be able to send them unless there is supply of containers,” Venugopal said. 

As much as 20,000 TEUs arrive a week to India from China and that has come down to almost 6,000 TEUs. 

During January 2019 Kochi received 2,806 TEUs, equivalent of 2,806 twenty-foot containers from China, which came down to 2,474 TEUs this January, a decline of 332 TEUs. It is the same case with other major import sources also. 

Similarly, South Korea had sent 378 TEUs in Jan 2019, which declined by 163 TEUs. Striking was the decline in imports from the UAE – the imports came down from 1,323 TEUs in January 2019 to 1,006 TEUs in January 2020, a decline of 317 TEUs. 

The impact of Covid-19 on the industries and businesses in India is yet to unfold fully, said Antony Thomas Kottaram, director, Kottaram Trading Company, Kochi. “We will not be spared from the global economic slowdown which is expected to hit us in near future,” he said.
