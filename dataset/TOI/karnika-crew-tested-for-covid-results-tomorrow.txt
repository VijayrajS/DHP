Panaji: After spending over 40 days on board Karnika while in Indian waters, members of the ship’s crew were tested for Covid-19 on Saturday. The results are expected by Monday.

On Monday, 93 crew members wrote to chief minister Pramod Sawant asking him to let them be placed under home quarantine on arrival in Goa. They said they couldn’t afford the paid quarantine charges of Rs 3,000 a day. They also stated that they have been under quarantine for more than 40 days.

“Our cruise ship has not had a single suspected case of Covid-19 on board till date, let alone a positive case, since the outbreak last year,” they wrote. 

“Moreover, no crew member (approximately 650 during operational voyages) on board the ship has shown any symptoms of the novel coronavirus from the time of its outbreak till date. A certificate fom our on-board doctor specially mentioning us 93 Goans was also enclosed in our earlier letter to you.” 

On Tuesday, Jalesh Cruises, owner and operator of Karnika, stated that the seaport public health office in Mumbai gave the crew their medical clearance. On March 31, crew members domiciled in Mumbai were permitted to disembark.

Ports secretary P S Reddy said that although the government wrote to the company, it was yet to receive any confirmation from the company about its plans to disembark crew.
