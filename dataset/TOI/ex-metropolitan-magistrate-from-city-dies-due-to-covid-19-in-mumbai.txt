Nagpur: A former metropolitan magistrate, a native of Gopal Nagar in the city, died due to Covid-19 at a private hospital in Mumbai on Thursday.

The deceased risked his own life while attempting to help his 82-year-old client, a coronavirus positive patient, get the right treatment at a hospital in Mumbai.

According to lawyer Siddharth Tayade from Akola, who knew the deceased personally, it was a classic case of saving a life at the cost of risking one’e own. 

“His client was deserted by his family. After getting help from him, the patient had recovered. However, the former magistrate contracted the virus and was admitted to a private hospital in Mumbai on May 25. After battling the disease for 11 days, he succumbed on June 4. He was cremated at Vile Parle in Mumbai in the presence of his family members and a few colleagues,” said Tayade. 

After completing his schooling and law degree from the city, he was inducted as Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC). Later, he was elevated as metropolitan magistrate in Mumbai. 

After taking voluntary retirement, the 65-year-old restarted practicing at the Bombay High Court. He had expertise in criminal, civil and service matters.

The former metropolitan magistrate was popular among his friends and colleagues. “He always helped people who were in dire need,” said Tayade. 

He is survived by wife, daughter, younger brothers, sister and a large number of relatives, friends and judicial colleagues.
