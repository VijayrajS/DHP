Russian, British tourists improvise amid lockdown
2020-03-25
PANAJI: Several Russian tourists are stranded in Goa, including entire families on vacation. Trade body Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) estimates the number of British travellers stuck in Goa due to the lockdown at over 200, besides around 40 Portuguese nationals.


Roman Naumov, attached to the Russian Information Centre, on Tuesday contacted the Mapusa district hospital wanting to know if the hospital conducts Covid-19 tests. He was asked to contact Dr S M Bandekar, dean Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim.

Naumov said some Russian tourists are facing difficulties as the lodges or hotels they stay at have started demanding doctor’s certificates or test reports that confirm that he or she is negative for Covid-19. 

“Goa is very hospitable, but few (tourists) do face problems,” he said. Several of them, including families, he said, have been unable to leave India due to the lockdown. Russian tourists mostly stay in Arambol, Morjim, Siolim and Ashvem.

Naumov said some of them are more than happy to stay put here, rather than travel at the risk of getting the infection. “Goa is quite safe, as no Covid-19 case has been detected here,” he said.

TTAG president Savio Messias said they mostly stay in lodges and guesthouses or rented houses. “These are mostly long-stay tourists. They shop locally,” he said.

A resident of Arambol said it was no surprise that in the last decade many grocery stores have cropped up in coastal villages of North Goa. “They are all stocked for the benefit of tourists. Look at Siolim— it has so many commercial stores, including fruit vendors catering to Russian tourists,” he said.
