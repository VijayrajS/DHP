Bihar: Speaker for lockdown till month-end
2020-05-14
PATNA: Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Wednesday strongly pitched for extension of lockdown and asked for its extension till May end, as the return of the migrant workers had led to an increase in the number of corona positive cases.

Choudhary added that the return of the migrants from other states has aggravated the situation in the state and there is an increased pressure on the quarantine centres. Lockdown extension will give some time to efficiently handle the situation arising after the arrival of migrant workers. “The arrival of migrants had reduced the problems of the states sending them, but it has increased the problems of receiving state like Bihar manifold,” Choudhary added.

The return of workers would continue for another 10 days, and accordingly, the people of Bihar and the state government will have to remain prepared to face the challenges.

Even as some relaxations have been made to facilitate agriculture, construction activity and agro-based industries, it is necessary that restrictions on free movement of people should continue.
