JAIPUR: The urban development and housing (UDH) department plans to make majority of its operations online in post-Covid world.

In a review meeting, chaired by the UDH principal secretary, discussions were made to provide several approvals online, including building plan, name transfer, lease money transfer in all the urban local bodies (ULBs).

A senior official said, “While, the online system has started at few local bodies and development authority, the department of Information Technology and communication will launch online system in the state.”

After the department had terminated the contract of the firm which was appointed to provide online infrastructure in ULBs of the state, plans are afoot to develop the system on its own. An official said, to provide relief to thousands of residents under the ambitious Smart Raj project, the firm was appointed to develop online infrastructure in 187 ULBs in a phase-wise manner. However, despite giving several extensions, the firm failed to complete the assigned work.

An official source said, “Out of 187 ULBs, the firm had not started work in 56. Moreover, the work in 131 remaining ULBs was not completed.”

Now, the department will plan to take up a project which can provide a relief to the people by issuing online system for birth, death, marriage registration, building permission, online cash module, trade licencing management, tender and work management etc.

The project will also aim to push the ease of doing business in the state.

“After the Covid, social distancing will be necessary and once system is developed the residents will not have to undergo through the tormenting bureaucratic processes for acquiring several licences and approvals from different departments.”
