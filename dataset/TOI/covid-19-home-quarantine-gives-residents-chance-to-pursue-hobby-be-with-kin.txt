Dehradun: With several government and private employees being given ‘work from home’ facility and colleges and schools being shut in view of the coronavirus pandemic, people are getting to spend time with their loved ones, complete backlog works, and even pursue their long-forgotten hobbies. 

“I love baking and this self-quarantine time has given me the opportunity to cook. I baked bread at home and it was better than what I buy from the market. I also love to write, so, I am trying to pen something interesting. Also, I am making sure to sanitise every corner of my house,” said Colonel P Goyal, a resident of Raipur Road.

In a similar vein, Rajesh Nautiyal, another residentwho lives in Sai Lok locality, said, “I hardly get to spend time with my family due to work-related commitments. But this crisis has given me an opportunity to be with my loved ones. Work-related meetings are being carried out via video conferencing and we are saving on commute time.” 

Ishwar Chand Chawla, who is also the president of a residents’ welfare association, told TOI, “There is always a lot of society-related work. This quarantine situation has finally given us some time to ensure that our society Ashirwad Enclave is clean and safe.”

Several residents, especially the elderly, are also spreading awareness regarding the benefits of social distancing which has been prescribed as a way to combat Covid-19.
