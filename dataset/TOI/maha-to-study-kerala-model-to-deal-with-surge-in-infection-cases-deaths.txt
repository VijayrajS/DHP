Covid-19: Maharashtra health experts to study Kerala model, conduct death audit
2020-04-11
PUNE: Reeling from one of the highest mortality rates in the country, the state government has decided to study Kerala’s model in dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak and its success in flattening the pandemic graph.


While Maharashtra has a mortality rate of nearly 7%, Kerala, which reported the country’s first Covid-19 case in January, has the lowest mortality rate of 0.6%.

 

Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state on pandemic control, said he was speaking to a team of experts in Pune and Mumbai and a death audit would be conducted. The Kerala government’s proactive measures in controlling the mortality rate would also be analysed.

“Depending on the death audit report, there may be a need to change the treatment protocol. We will share the same with the Indian Council of Medical Research and All India Institute of Medical Sciences and will also be speaking to the Kerala government to know how they tackle severe cases,” he told TOI.

Speaking to TOI, Kerala’s principal secretary, health, Rajan Khobragade, said coronavirus is only the latest among the public health challenges the state has battled in the past few years. Besides two devastating floods that caused a health crisis, the state has also faced outbreaks of KFD, bird flu and Nipah. “We are fighting all these with public participation and involvement. Highest transparency is what we are ensuring in all our interventions,” he said.
