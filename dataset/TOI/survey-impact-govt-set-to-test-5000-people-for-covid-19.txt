PANAJI: The state government has said that of the 30,000 people who were identified with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) during the three-day house-to-house community survey, nearly 5,000 will be tested for Covid-19.

“The tests will be undertaken in a phased manner as per testing protocol,” health secretary Nila Mohanan told the state executive committee.

After the completion of the survey, a committee headed by Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, head of preventive and social medicine at GMC, submitted a report to the state government. 

Last week, CM Pramod Sawant said that the 30,000 would be screened on the basis of their and their family’s travel history, and suspects would be tested for Covid-19. Goa’s last Covid-19 positive case was detected on April 3. It currently has none.

In total, Goa has had seven positive cases, all of whom have recovered as of Tuesday. 

The survey, conducted by nearly 7,000 government employees, covered almost 5 lakh houses in the state, and was done on a polling booth basis. Residents were asked six questions prepared by the health department. Sawant had said that based on the survey, the government would “be able to declare Goa a safe zone vis-a-vis Covid-19”.
