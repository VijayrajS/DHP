Gumla: The Simdega administration on Wednesday collected blood and swab samples of 12 persons from Thetaitangar after a 17-year-old boy from the village tested positive for Covid-19 a day earlier.

“After we received instructions from deputy commissioner Mirtyunjay Kumar Barnawal, the village and its adjoining area were sanitized and then sealed,” Thetaitangar BDO Manoj Kumar said.

District officials said the teenager returned to Simdega on March 31 after staying briefly at a mosque in Balsokra village under Chanho block of Ranchi district. Kumar said the teenager returned with three more persons, while another group of two people returned separately. 

“Among the five, only one tested positive. The others have been quarantined. So far, 32 persons have been tested,” Simdega civil surgeon P K Sinha said. A door-to-door survey is being carried out in the containment zone, added Sinha.

“The corona-positive teenager had visited Balsokra to attend a religious congregation,” said a senior police officer in Lohardaga. One of the persons he met has been traced to Kuru in Lohardaga, the officer added. 

“The movement of public in the containment zone has been curbed, while a control room has been set up at Thetaitangar police station to assist the residents in procuring essentials,” Simdega SP Sanjiv Kumar said.
