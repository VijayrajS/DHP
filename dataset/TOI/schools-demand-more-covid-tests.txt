Schools demand more Covid-19 tests in Delhi
2020-06-07
NEW DELHI: Heads of government schools have been writing to the education department and district magistrates asking them for testing their teaching staff, requesting closure of the meal distribution centres and complaining about the lack of sanitisation in government schools. 

The head of school of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector 11, wrote to the education department recently, informing them of a ministerial staff deployed at a hunger relief centre testing positive for Covid-19. Eight other teachers and staff had come in contact with the said person. 

“It is quite possible that some other teachers have also caught the viral infection. I request you to please look into the matter and place an order for the school staff to go on self-quarantine. I also request you to please close the hunger relief centre in view of the increasing cases of Covid-19 among staff members,” the letter stated.

A similar letter was written by the head of school at Shalimar Village to the DM (North West) highlighting that though the school has been functioning as a dry ration distribution centre for over two months, not a single test for novel coronavirus had been done so far. “Through various letters, I have made a request to arrange for Covid testing for all employees engaged in distribution of food for the past two months, along with sanitising the premises. But sorry to say not a single test or sanitisation has been arranged by any authorities till date,” the letter claimed.

A senior education official said they would look into the concerns raised by the principals.
