HYDERABAD: The state health department on Thursday said it will continue to monitor 536 people as part of their Coronavirus containment plan. Most of these people have a travel history traced to countries affected by the virus, of whom at least half are software professionals who have returned from assignments. All of them are being monitored in home isolation. It was announced that any person coming from any foreign country and showing symptoms of viral infection will be treated as a Coronavirus suspect.


“Altogether 146 of suspected cases have now completed the quarantine period. They can be safely assumed to be free of the virus. The remaining will continue to be in isolation, till they complete the 28-day period calculated from the date of return to India. As per the containment plan by Centre, teams have been set up at district, village, mandal and ward-level in urban areas,” said Dr G Srinivas Rao, Telangana director of public health.

“Each health worker in the surveillance team monitors three suspected patients every day. Their role is to ensure that the suspected remain in quarantine for the 28-day period,” Srinivas said. According to the containment plan, surveillance on the three kilometre radius around the patient’s house is already under way in Mahendra Hills.

“Any person having symptoms will be identified and put in isolation. As per protocol, active door-to-door surveillance will increase to 100 houses and further in case of local transmission being confirmed,” said the public health director. Due to opposition from neighbours after four family members of the lone Covid 19 positive patient, returned to Mahendra Hills, the state health department stationed a four-member team in front of the house to ensure that family members remain in quarantine for the prescribed period of fourteen days.
