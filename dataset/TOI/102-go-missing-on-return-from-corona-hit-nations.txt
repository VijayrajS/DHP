As many as 55 samples were tested, of which 47 came out negative while one turned out to be positive. The test results of the remaining seven are pending.

KS Jawahar Reddy, special chief secretary (health), told TOI that over 100 people who returned to the state from coronavirus-affected countries are yet to be traced. 

“We are making extra efforts with support of other departments to trace them. The untraced cases are due to either not having phone numbers or residential address. Medical and health officials are also collecting data from airport authorities, ports and a few others departments to trace the 102 ‘missing’ persons,” he added. 

Village volunteers have launched a door-to-door survey to identify those who arrived in the state after February 10 from others countries.
