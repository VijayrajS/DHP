MYSURU: Indian Council of Medical Research – recognized viral lab in Mysuru has come in handy for not just authorities in Mysuru but to those in five districts of south Karnataka during the pandemic as the lab has alleviated the burden on state’s lab. 


It takes six hours to test a sample and give results. Scores of samples are tested each day in three shifts making it one of the busiest covid Lab in Karnataka. 

The lab has conducted nearly 13,000 tests so far, second highest in the state after the lab in Bengaluru which as conducted 20,303 tests as on May 17. 

It has tested samples of patients suspected to have caught the virus in Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Mandya, Kodagu and even in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in the last two months. As many as 1,552 samples from Chamarajanga and 1,432 from Kodagu, both green districts, have been tested in Mysuru. 

On an average, the lab is conducting over 500 tests per day with support from Defence Food Research Laboratory’s mobile unit. Even the Central Food Technological Research Institute has supported the lab with equipment. 

This was the first ICMR-recognised lab in south Karnataka and has three trained staff who are working round the clock since the pandemic, says Dr CP Nanjaraj, dean and director of Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute. 

“The lab was opened in February 2017 as viral test laboratory. But after the outbreak, it was upgraded to a Covid lab. Initially we conducted close to 100 tests every day but gradually increased its capacity with support of central agencies. Today, the lab has a capacity to do anywhere between 500 and 600 tests a day,” he adds.
