Aurangabad: City-based Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has started testing swap samples of coronavirus suspect patients at its Viral Research and Diagnostics Laboratory (VRDL).

On Sunday, the first day of the lab’s operations, four samples were tested and the result of all the samples came out to be negative. With this development, the administration will no longer have to send the swab samples to Pune’s National Institute of Virology.

Of the 4 samples tested on Sunday, two were sent by the district civil hospital while the remaining two are undergoing treatment at the GMCH. The GMCH was supposed to get the VRDL last year after getting the approval of the state cabinet. However, there was a delay in getting the necessary machine and equipment.

The hospital received the machine to the run the VRDL on Saturday along with the kits to carry out Covid-19 tests.

According to medical superintendent Suresh Harbade, the kit needs a minimum of 50 samples for one round of analysis otherwise the kit gets wasted. “On the first day, the test was carried out with only 4 swabs as the NIV accreditation was awaited. It takes 8 hours to complete the analysis,” he said.

“Samples from four districts under deputy director of health services Aurangabad division i.e. Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani and Jalna will be tested at this facility,” he added.

Currently, there are 666 patients that are being followed up by the district health authorities. 12 people have been placed at Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) quarantine facility at Kalagram Exhibition Centre in Chikalthana MIDC.

“None of the 126 patients tested so far from the district have tested positive. One person who had earlier tested positive has recovered from Covid-19,” district civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni said.
