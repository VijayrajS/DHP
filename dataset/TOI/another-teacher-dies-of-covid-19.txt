AHMEDABAD: Another teacher of working for the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) school board has succumbed to the novel coronavirus. Vishwanath Shripati, a senior teacher of Thakkarbapanagar Hindi School No.2, died at GCS hospital on Naroda Road on Friday after being admitted for around three days. 

Shripati, 55, a resident of the Bapunagar area of city, was deployed in survey work and in food distribution by the government for around two months. 

“Shripati fell ill on the night of May 12 and was admitted to GCS Hospital where he died of Covid-19 on Friday,” said Ilyas Qureshi, member of the AMC school board. 

This is the second death of a teacher in a fortnight. 

Qureshi said that earlier on April 30, principal of Shahpur Urdu school number-5 Mohammed Yasin Shaikh died of the novel coronavirus infection at Civil hospital in the Asarwa area of city. 

Qureshi alleged that neither the state education department nor the AMC school board have been providing enough masks, gloves and sanitizers to teachers deployed in survey and distribution work. Due to this, 12 teachers have been infected by the virus and one of them is still on the ventilator.

Qureshi earlier raised this issue with education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, seeking proper safety materials for teacher but the representation went unheard, he said.

Lagdhir Desai, administrative officer of the AMC school board, claimed that teachers are given proper safety materials like masks, gloves and sanitizers and they were also instructed to maintain social distancing. 

“We have told teachers that they can buy safety materials and put their expenditure in the school budget which will be passed by us. The government has also given them proper stocks of masks and sanitizers,” said Desai.
