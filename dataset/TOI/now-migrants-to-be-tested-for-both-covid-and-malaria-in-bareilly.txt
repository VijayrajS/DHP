Bareilly: After two migrant workers were recently diagnosed with malaria in Bareilly, the health department has now decided to test migrants with fever for both Covid-19 and malaria. Bareilly has been reporting an outbreak of malaria for the past two years as 37,482 cases in 2018 and 46,717 cases in 2019 were reported in the district.

According to sources, a man, who returned to Ramnagar from Maharashtra, and another person, who migrated from Delhi to Bhamora’s Sirohi village, were recently tested positive for malaria. Both Ramnagar and Bhamora have been identified as highly sensitive blocks for malaria in Bareilly district. After the duo complained of fever, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers examined them with rapid diagnostic kits. They both tested positive for malaria.

Bareilly divisional surveillance officer Dr Akhileshwar Singh told TOI, “The migrants with fever are currently being screened for Covid-19 but such migrants will now also be tested for malaria. Many people from other states have returned to villages. To contain the spread of malaria in the district, our policy is immediate detection and prompt treatment. Migrants with fever will be tested for both Covid-19 and malaria.”

In 2017, only 274 malaria cases were detected in Bareilly and the number of total cases spiralled to 37,482 in 2018. After a large number of people had mysteriously died due to Covid-19, teams of the Centre and state government had found presence of malaria in the region. Of the total 37,482 cases reported in 2018, 17,425 cases were of plasmodium falciparum (PF), a “killer” strain of malaria, while the remaining cases were of plasmodium vivax (PV), a common variant. 

Uttar Pradesh recorded 86,486 malaria cases in 2018 and of these, the highest number of cases was reported in Bareilly district with 37,482. Similarly, a total of 92,732 cases of malaria were reported in UP in 2019 and of these, Bareilly district recorded the maximum cases with 46,717, including 12,141 PF cases.

Director (health), Bareilly division, Dr Rakesh Dubey said, “I have directed health staff to focus on both malaria and Covid-19 in Bareilly.”
