450 two-wheelers parked in Trichy bus stand since lockdown
2020-05-22
Trichy: Owners of around 450 two-wheelers parked for the past two months at Trichy corporation’s parking lot in Central bus stand will end up paying hefty parking fees. These people had got stranded outside Trichy due to the suspension of public transport when the lockdown was declared. Since public transport is unlikely to resume before May 31, these vehicle owners are in a fix. Sprawling over 25,000 square feet, the corporation’s parking lot in central bus stand can accommodate 1,600 two-wheelers at a time. The three-storey building was of great use for people visiting other districts and towns to park their vehicles and board buses or trains from Trichy railway junction nearby. “At least 450 two-wheelers have been parked in our facility for more than 55 days. As we collect Rs 10 per day as fee, the owners will have to pay Rs 550 per vehicle to retrieve their two-wheelers,” N Rangarajan, manager of the corporation’s parking lot in Central bus stand, said. So far, only a few people had managed to avail e-pass and return to the city in their own vehicles and taken back their two-wheelers. With no other vehicles using the facility, those running the parking lot said their revenue has plunged. “Once public transport resumes, we expect the people to take back their vehicles,” he added.
