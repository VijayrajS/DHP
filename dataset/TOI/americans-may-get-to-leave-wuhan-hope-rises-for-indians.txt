BEIJING/NEW DELHI: India on Sunday opened a third hotline for its 250-odd students and other citizens caught in the coronavirus-induced lockdown in Wuhan even as China offered to evacuate Americans stranded there, raising hopes of similar arrangements being made for Indians.


Although there is no official confirmation yet, the government is believed to have requested the Chinese authorities to enable the evacuation of Indian students in Wuhan, most of them studying medicine.

About 700 Indian students are estimated to be studying in universities in Wuhan and its nearby areas. The majority of these students are said to have left Wuhan and other areas of Hubei province during the Chinese New Year holidays a few weeks ago. The rest stayed back, little knowing that Wuhan and 12 other cities would be sealed off to stop the coronavirus outbreak from spreading.

“As of now, we understand that no Indian citizen has been affected by the outbreak and food and water supplies are available to them,” India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, said. In the past 24 hours, China has reported 15 more coronavirus deaths and confirmed 680 new cases. The number of people infected by the virus till Sunday evening stood at 1975.
