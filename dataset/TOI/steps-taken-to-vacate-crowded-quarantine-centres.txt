Steps taken to vacate crowded quarantine centres
2020-05-19
Kolhapur: As many as 6,000 quarantined travellers, who have spent more than a week in the Covid-19 facilities, are yet to get their swab reports. On an average 2,000 samples are added daily to get their testing done.

So far swab reports of 11,000 people have been collected and sent for testing. One such traveller, who is currently quarantined in Shivaji University since May 12, is still awaiting for his swab report. "There were just 30 travellers in the facility when I was taken here. Now more than 500 people are here. None of us who were bought here have received the test reports without which we are not allowed to go back to our home," said the man, who also alleged that people who came late have been turned back. 

To ease the pressure on the over occupied quarantine centres, the district authorities have decided to take an undertaking from the travellers to stay at the village-level quarantine centres for some days or get quarantined at home. If the travellers jump the quarantine they have to face police complaint from village administrations. 

On Friday, district collector Daulat Desai wrote to state police to restrict the entry of travellers from Pune and Mumbai, which are declared as hotspots. 

Satej Patil, district guardian minister, said, "I myself have spoken to police officials asking them not to allow people to travel. The number is expected to come down. I have however asked the village level and ward level committees to be vigilant and isolate people arriving from red zone areas. We have contained the spread of the covid only because we are quarantining travellers."
