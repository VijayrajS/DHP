2020-04-28
Nashik: The call from Nandurbar district collector Rajendra Bharud, requesting people to join the anti-Covid force (ACF) has evoked good response with around 3,000 people, including teachers and NCC cadets, submitting their applications.“People from all walks of life are coming forward to contribute for the social help at a time when the administration needs it the most to fight the spread of Covid-19 amid the lockdown,” Bharud said.The collector thanked all the people for showing their readiness in helping the society in the time of crisis. "There were two reasons for making the appeal. First, actual shortage of staff and second is automatic transfer of responsibility to fight against Covid-19 from the government to common man and individual as well," another senior district administration official said. "When the volunteers registered for the cause, they actually were aware and ready to contribute to help the government. This further meant that all these people would start following the best prevention practices," he added.The official also pointed out that there are 1,600 police personnel in the district of which 300 were either on leave, unwell, or have illnesses owing to which they cannot be on the field.The district — with a population of around 20 lakh — also has large number of roads connected to neighbouring districts and states. "Practically it would not be easy for the police to remain present at every point and check infiltration. Due to this we recently started Village Defence Force (VDF) that comprises locals," the official said.The VDFs are being used only to man the borders, whereas the ACF will be used for things like providing help and guarding containment zones, spreading the information about Covid-19, setting up of skits that would take the message of cleanliness to the people, among others.The volunteers will be provided specific instructions and duty assignment by the local Block Development Officers and police.
