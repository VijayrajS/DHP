Bareilly: A 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old youth were tested positive for Covid-19 in Bareilly on Thursday. Both the persons returned to Bareilly from Mumbai by a truck on May 9.

District surveillance officer Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “After they reached Bareilly on May 9, the duo went to primary health centre in Ramnagar. They were referred to 300-bed government hospital where they were quarantined. Though their first report was tested negative for Covid-19, officials at Indian Veterinary Research Institute asked us to send their samples again after four days. They were not discharged from hospital and have been quarantined since their arrival to Bareilly. Their second report - which arrived on Thursday - found them positive for Covid-19. They will now be shifted to Covid-19 level one hospital.”

According to officials, the 32-year-old man is a native of Sirauli under Aonla sub-division of Bareilly while the 23-year-old youth is a resident of Meerganj town of the district. “We are tracing those who came in contact with them and their samples will be collected for testing,” Gautam said.

With this, the total number of Covid-19 cases reached 12 in Bareilly. These include 10 discharged patients. Notably, Bareilly was left with no active case on Wednesday, but then these two new cases surfaced a day later.
