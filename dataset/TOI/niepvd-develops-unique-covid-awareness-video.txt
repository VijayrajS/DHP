2020-05-03
Dehradun: In a first of its kind, Dehradun-based National Institute for Empowerment of People with Visual Disabilities (NIEPVD) has developed an innovative method to create awareness about Covid-19 among people with disabilities. The method developed by NIEPVD uses Odissi classical dance moves combined with Indian sign languages. These awareness videos are aimed at the disabled, especially those with hearing impairment. Nachiketa Rout, director of NIEPVD, said, “Covid-19 awareness materials are available in various formats across platforms. We wanted to make it inclusive for the Indian audience. We made it keeping in mind that it should be depictive, classical and cover people with disabilities as well. The story was formulated by an Odissi dancer and a sign-language interpreter.”
