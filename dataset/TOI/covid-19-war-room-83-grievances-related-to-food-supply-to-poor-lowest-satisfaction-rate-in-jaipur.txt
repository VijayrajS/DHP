2020-06-07
JAIPUR: A whopping 2.57 lakh Covid-related grievances have been registered on Rajasthan Sampark portal, at a rate of 3,400 complaints per day, from March 24 to June 5. Of these, 2.14 lakh grievances (83.2%) were related to ‘supply of food to the needy’. Highest number of grievances was registered in Jaipur, at 1.52 lakh, with lowest satisfaction rate of 41.49% only.


Of the total, 98% (2.53 lakh) cases have been disposed of and 4,139 are still pending. After Jaipur, Kota registered second-lowest satisfaction rate of just 60.8% followed by Tonk at 71.34%.





Of the 1.52 lakh grievances (59%) registered in Jaipur, 1.49 lakh cases (98.4%) have been disposed of. Grievances pending with the district are 364, pending for verification are 1,818 and not pending with district are 178.

Of the total grievances registered under the category ‘supplying food to the needy’ (2.14 lakh), 2.11 lakh cases (98.5) have been disposed of so far. In all, 12,788 grievances were registered with regard to shortage of food supplies and 12,556 cases have been disposed of.

Bhilwara is at distant second in registration of grievances at 14,312 and of these, 14,193 cases (99.12%) have been disposed. “The satisfaction rate in Jaipur is low because of large number of grievances related to supply of food/ration kits. In numerous cases, the administration found these were fake complaints, where the families already had ration in their house. In some cases, the families were demanding ration kits repeatedly despite being given to them. In other cases, they were demanding more than the amount allotted to them by the government. So, all these cases fell under the category of ‘not satisfied’,” said G K Sharma, additional director and officer-in-charge Rajasthan Sampark.

“There are 400 seats in the war room under Sampark portal and these are located at the Secretariat, Kisan Bhawan and a few other locations,” he added.
