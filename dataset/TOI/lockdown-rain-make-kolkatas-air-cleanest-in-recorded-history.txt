Lockdown, rain make Kolkata’s air cleanest in recorded history
2020-04-29
KOLKATA: Long-term lockdown and a downpour pushed all pollutants — PM2.5, PM10, SO2 NO2, CO, benzene and ammonia — below the stringent WHO standard, making city’s air the cleanest in the entire country. It was also the cleanest in Kolkata’s recorded history. Experts said such air quality will help people suffering from heart, lung and kidney ailments in battling the Covid-19 far more effectively. 


“Lockdown has transformed the air and water quality significantly. Hundreds of emission-controlling measures worth hundreds of crores could not have brought the pollution level down so effectively,” said Subhas Datta, city’s foremost environment crusader.

“Air pollution contributes to co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and make people vulnerable to Covid-19. The clean air, on the other hand, enables one to fight the pandemic effectively,” said Arun Sharma, professor-director (community medicine), University College of Medical Sciences, University of Delhi.

Moreover, a polluted area will have more dust particles that can act as a carrier for the virus. “The cleaning up of air significantly coincides with introduction of BS-VI emission standard. The superior emission technology will reduce the pollution. But at the same time, we have to phase out old polluting vehicles more effectively,” said Prabir Bose, a leading automobile expert. 

While the lockdown brought down the overall pollution level drastically, Tuesday’s downpour did the rest, cleaning up the air to such an extent that the presence of pollutants in the air was negligible. The lockdown evidently has had an even bigger impact on NO2 levels. “It is now our collective responsibility to maintain the air quality. If we can dot that, we can get rid many of diseases. Otherwise, we would invite more trouble,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, environment activist and automobile emission consultant. Ghosh added that people must understand that polluted air can make a pandemic more potent.
