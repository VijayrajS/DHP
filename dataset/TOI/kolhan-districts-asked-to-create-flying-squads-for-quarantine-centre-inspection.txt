JAMSHEDPUR: Kolhan divisional commissioner Virendra Bhushan on Friday said he asked deputy commissioners of East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts to prepare flying squads for surprise inspection of the quarantine centres under their respective jurisdictions. 

“I have written letters to all the deputy commissioners in this regard so that quarantine centres are regulated in a better way,” Bhushan said. The squads will monitor availability of food, water and electricity at these centres,” he added. 

Incidentally, migrants at a centre in Macha under Patamda block refused to take food on Thursday night and demanded that they be released. Patamda block officials released 10 migrants on Friday and assured to release the rest, if their Covid-19 test reports turned are negative. Around 8,000 migrants have returned to Kolhan since May 1. 

Meanwhile, East Singhbhum administration announced that the Integrated Data Capturing and Reporting System (IDCRS) will be launched from May 31. 

The objective of IDCRS is to store data of migrants in a digital format to help track them.

DC Ravi Shankar Shukla asked the district education superintendent, Vineet Kumar, to deploy schoolteachers at checkpoints for collection and entry of migrants’ data.
