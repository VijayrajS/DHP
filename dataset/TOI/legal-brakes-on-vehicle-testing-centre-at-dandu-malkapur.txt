Legal brakes on vehicle testing centre at Dandu Malkapur
2020-01-20
Hyderabad: The Advanced Vehicle Inspection and Fitness Centre, being constructed at Dandu Malkapur between Hyderabad and Yadadri-Bhongir, is stuck in a legal limbo. After hitting several roadblocks in the past nine years, the high court has ordered that work be stalled until further orders, as some people are claiming that the land belongs to a mining company.

“Earlier, no contractor was willing to come forward and take up works, as part of the land on which the testing centre was being constructed was under conflict. The transport department’s plans to inaugurate the centre in May last year also failed, even though tenders to finish work were called twice. And now, there is a stay order from the high court after some people claimed that the land belonged to a mining company,” said M Dayanand, general secretary, Telangana State Auto and Motor Welfare Association.

The one-of-its-kind facility can test over 300 vehicles daily — trucks, RTC buses, auto-rickshaws, school and college buses, cabs and goods carries — and enable them obtain computerised fitness certificates. It is being constructed by the transport department to eliminate human interference and curb corruption and other illegal practices during vehicle fitness checks.

Regional Transport Authority (RTA) officials said that they were just one step away from starting operations at the Advanced Vehicle Inspection and Fitness Centre. “Almost all the work required to commence the centre is complete. Allegations stating that the land belongs to a mining company are not true. We will inaugurate the centre once the stay order is lifted,” said C Ramesh, joint transport commissioner, RTA.
