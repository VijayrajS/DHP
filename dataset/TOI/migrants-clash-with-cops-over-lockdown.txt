2020-03-30
Surat: A group of more than 1,000 migrants clashed with the police in Vadod area of Pandesara in the city late on Sunday night. The group of labourers was demanding permission to go to their native places while the police teams were enforcing lockdown and asked these people to stay put in their homes. In Pandesara majority of the labourers are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and were alleging that they are not getting regular food supply and not being allowed to go to their native places either.

During the clash, the crowd of angry migrants also pelted stones and damaged a few police vehicles. To control the riotous crowd, police lobbed teargas shells and also fired in the air. Police force comprising more than 250 policemen, state reserve police (SRP) battalion personnel and cops from special operation group, prevention of crime branch and detection of crime branch rushed to the spot to control the situation.

"The residents were demanding permission to let them go while police were requesting them to stay at their homes. The situation turned tense and the crowd attacked police. The unruly situation was immediately brought under control by the police using maximum force to ensure peace in the area," said city police commissioner, R B Brahmbhatt.

Police teams started patrolling in the area and have also started investigating to find out if the labourers were instigated by some community leaders. 

Senior police officials have expressed concerns in the past couple of days about the rising demand of migrant labourers to be allowed to go back to their native places. 

Apart from ensuring lockdown in the city areas police are facing the biggest challenge in controlling the movement of these migrant labourers, who are trying various options to reach home across the borders.
