Don’t relax lockdown, says Kanna
2020-04-13
Guntur: BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana has urged chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to continue the lockdown in the state without making changes to the existing rules. He said relaxation on the pretext of green zones would make it difficult to contain the spread of the disease.

Lakshminarayana, in a letter to the chief minister on Sunday, said that it was foolishness to think about reviving the economic activity at this juncture. “It is unfortunate that chief minister Jagan is thinking about relaxing the lockdown by categorising the state into red-zone, orange zone and green zone even as the number of positive cases are going up. Any decision to relax the lockdown will make the entire state vulnerable,” said Lakshminarayana.

He said even the World Health Organisation has praised the decision of Centre to impose country-wide lockdown to tackle the pandemic. tnn
