HYDERABAD: The 24-year-old software employee, who tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19), is likely to be discharged from Gandhi Hospital within a week. He was admitted to the hospital nine days ago with fever, cough, and cold. 


According to containment plan shared by the ministry of health and family welfare, "Persons testing positive for Covid-19 will remain hospitalised till two of their samples are tested negative." However, hospital sources said that the patient has shown significant recovery and the first sample tested at the ICMR lab on Monday has come negative.

"The patient's condition is better than earlier and he is eating home cooked food now. He will be tested as soon as all his symptoms subside," said a highly-placed source.

The Centre's plan states, "Dedicated intensive care beds need to be earmarked. Some among them may progress to multi-organ failure and hence critical care facility, dialysis facility, and salvage therapy, Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenator (ECMO) facility for managing respiratory/renal complications/multi-organ failure shall be required. If such facilities are not available in the containment zone, nearest tertiary care facility in government/private sector needs to be identified."

The government also estimated that about 15% of the patients are likely to develop pneumonia, 5% of whom will require ventilator management.
