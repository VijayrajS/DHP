Increase testing where cases have been found, urge RWAs

Hyderabad: With a high number of positive cases being reported from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, residents living in containment clusters are urging authorities to conduct tests for people living in the vicinity of the house or apartment where a flat/ building has been contained. 

“A family, which includes a five-month-old baby, in our housing society was tested positive. Authorities had not tested the parents for two days even after their five-month-old tested positive. The parents then got themselves checked. Testing people in containment clusters is the need of the hour,” said Praveen Rao, joint secretary of a residential society in Gachibowli. 

Lashing out at the officials, another resident of the society, said: “After the baby was tested positive, it was admitted in a private hospital and the parents were sent back. As the parents are the primary contacts, they should have tested immediately by the hospital management or by the government. The government did not bother to test them despite society members informing Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).” 

Some residents also requested that staffers working in supermarkets and grocery stores in their locality should also be tested. A request was raised by a resident of Sri Ram Nagar Colony (Kondapur), where a software engineer was tested positive. “ I request the government to at least test the people who are above 60 years,” said a senior citizen from the area. According to officials, they are following government orders. 

An official on Covid-19 duty said, “We are conducting fever survey around the contained flat/house. About 500 metres area around the house contained is marked as buffer zone. As per government orders, asymptomatic people are not being tested for Covid-19.”
