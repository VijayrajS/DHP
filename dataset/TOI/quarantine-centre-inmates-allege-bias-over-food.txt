Quarantine centre inmates allege bias over food

BHOPAL: Labourers housed in two quarantine centres in MP’s Sheopur have alleged discrimination in food, claiming they are being served ‘sookhi roti’ while restaurant fare is being served in the quarantine centres housing family members of some traders.

Around 10 localities of Badoda tehsil of Sheopur, bordering Rajasthan, were declared containment zones after a Covid-19 patient was detected in the small town. A government school and hostel and a marriage garden were converted into quarantine centres and 66 people moved there.

Thirty-nine labourers and their families are housed in the school and hostel, say sources in the administration. Gopal Sharma and Dipu Sharma, who are quarantined in the hostel, allege that they are being served “dry chapattis, rolled in a piece of paper, and dal”. Besides, they say, they don’t even have fans in this scorching weather.

Those quarantined in the marriage garden are getting packed hotel food and sweets, they allege. “Just because we are poor, the administration is discriminating with us,” they alleged. A local activist, C P Sharma, has filed a complaint with the local administration. 

Officials deny the allegations. The district administration’s spokesperson, J P Rathore, said there is no discrimination in food and other facilities among people quarantined in the three centres.

Last week, a whistleblower was allegedly attacked by panchayat employees in the same district after he complained about the “plight of four men at a quarantine centre” on social media.
