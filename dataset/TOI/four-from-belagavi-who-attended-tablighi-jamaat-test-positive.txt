Belagavi: Four people from Belagavi tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday.

According to the state bulletin, a 36-year-old woman, 40-year-old man, 67-year-old woman and 41-year-old woman, who hail from Raibagh taluk of Belagavi district, tested positive for Covid-19.

They had visited the Tablighi Jamaat congregation from March 13 to March 18. With this the total number of Covid-19 cases in the district stands at 7. The earlier three Covid-19 cases were also linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event.

The district administration has quarantined all the patients. The district administration has also begun contact tracing to isolate primary and secondary contacts.

Earlier in the day, a video clip claiming that two Covid-19 patients were loitering around corridors of the quarantine facility, showcasing that proper treatment was not given to the patients, surfaced on social media. This led many to question how the authorities were dealing with the crisis.

However, the deputy commissioner disputed the claims in a video briefing. He said, “Some audio and video clips are going viral on social media. I would like to inform that these materials are misleading in nature. Some people from outside are circulating this video, and we have already filed a case in the relevant police station. Action will be taken against the people who are circulating the video.” He said that all the Covid-19 patients are being treated as per protocol, and that there is no scope for any discrepancies.
