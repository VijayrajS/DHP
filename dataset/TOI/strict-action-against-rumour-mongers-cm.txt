KOLKATA: CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday warned legal action against those spreading rumours and fake news over Covid-19. The CM has asked Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma to lodge FIRs and take strong action against rumour-mongers and the fake news machinery.

By evening, the cyber cell of Kolkata Police launched a crackdown on all those spreading fake news in the city. Cops summoned around 12 people to Lalbazar and warned them of severe legal action if they continued their actions. Another 24 were called up and asked to remove the fake content from their social media handles/accounts.

Banerjee said the government had enforced the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, that provides sweeping powers to the authorities to take measures beyond the usual provisions of law. Sharma tweeted: “Do not forward corona-related messages without verifying. We are monitoring such posts on social media. Legal action will be taken against those who spread false news.”

At Salt Lake’s AJ block, locals vented their anger and almost ended up assaulting a 47-year-old resident of the block who had returned from London recently. A section of locals claimed the man had not isolated himself. Police then sent him for tests at Beliaghata ID hospital. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation officials said the man had returned on March 12. He was seen in the locality as usual.

At Bijoygarh near Jadavpur, rumours flew thick and fast about an Israeli — with a ‘history of illness’ — being harassed by locals. The fear increased in Digha after some French and German tourists were spotted. With both countries being severely affected, locals demanded they be immediately repatriated.
