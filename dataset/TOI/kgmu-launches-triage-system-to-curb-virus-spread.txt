KGMU launches triage system to curb coronavirus spread
2020-04-14
LUCKNOW: Patients visiting the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) with flu or Covid-19 symptoms will not have to run around for help while putting themselves or others at risk of infection.


KGMU has set up triage system to direct suspected patients from emergency casualty unit to neurology department where triage facility has been arranged.

The patients are tested at neurology department and sent to infectious diseases ward if their swab sample is found positive for Covid-19. If a patient is tested negative, he is sent to the department concerned for treatment.

The triage system, set up under head of pediatrics department Prof Shally Awasthi and Prof Kausar Usman of medicine department, entails sorting of patients based on requirement of immediate medical treatment.

Prof Usman said the facility was based on the ground floor of neurology department opposite the infectious disease ward where Covid patients were being isolated.

“When patients come to emergency, they are sent to triage if they have symptoms similar to Covid-19 and require admission. Symptomatic treatment is started and their samples are sent to microbiology department for testing,” he said.

“A patient is kept in triage for 24-36 hours till the report is received. If it is negative, they are sent to the department concerned for treatment, while positive patients are sent to Covid-19 ward. This eliminates the risk of infection to patients who might directly go to Covid-19 ward if the triage is not there,” he added.

The 12-bed facility has eight beds for adults and four for children. The facility also has two ventilators each for children and adults. Currently, 11 patients have been admitted to the triage. Till now, only one patient has been tested positive.
