MOSCOW: A vast and contentious network of facial recognition cameras keeping watch over Moscow is now playing a key role in the battle against the spread of the coronavirus. 


Since last month, thousands of Muscovites have been confined for 14 days of compulsory quarantine. Police have logged their details and warned them that sneaking out into the city could lead to a five-year jail term or deportation for foreigners. "We are checking that this regulation is being observed, including through the use of automated facial recognition systems," mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in his blog in February. 

Moscow already has 1,70,000 cameras over the past decade. Around 1,00,000 have now been linked to artificial intelligence systems. The remaining cameras are due to be connected soon. Police said last week that the cameras that helped them identify almost 200 people who broke quarantine rules.
