2020-04-16
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Police have registered a case against 16 foreign tourists, hailing from various countries, including Russia, UK, Canada and France, who ventured out to the beach in Kovalam to take bath on Tuesday, and against owners and staff of five hotels in the vicinity for breaching the lockdown restrictions.


However, owners of some of these hotels expressed concerns against the harsh measures being initiated against tourists and hotels, ‘which will be detrimental to revival of tourism sector in the state after the pandemic’. 

They also said that several tourists named in the list had not violated any lockdown rules and that hotels were even spending from their own pockets to accommodate them during the lockdown period.

According to police, the foreign tourists were seen taking bath as a group in Kovalam around 7am and were spotted by the lifeguards. 

“We have also initiated steps to collect CCTV camera footages, including from those installed in hotels, as part of the probe,” said Kovalam CI Anilkumar. 

The case has been registered invoking various provisions under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases ordinance.

Meanwhile, a top tourism official said it was up to the police to take any legal action required for violating lockdown rules. 

“Prima facie, there was an offence committed by the tourists, which we had to report to the police after being alerted by our tourism information officer stationed at Kovalam,” the official said.
