After the woman was identified positive, the new patients’ admission and diagnosis at the private hospital has been kept on hold. The swab sample testing of all the people will be done after five days later this week.

According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guideline on postnatal management, it is unknown whether newborns with Covid-19 are at increased risk for severe complications. “Transmission after birth via infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. Facilities should consider temporarily separating the mother who has confirmed Covid-19 from her baby until the mother’s transmission-based precautions are discontinued.”
