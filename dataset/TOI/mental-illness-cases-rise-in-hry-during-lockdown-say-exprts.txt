Rohtak/Jind: When the two-month long Covid-19 lockdown period was “unlocked”, doctors from Postgraduate Institute of Medical Science (PGIMS) in Rohtak said they started witnessing a spike in the number of mental health patients coming for treatment.

There has been no exception in the age group category — from children to adults, all are approaching with symptoms of anxiety and depression for treatment. 

Talking to TOI, Dr Rajiv Gupta, director of Institute of Mental Health in PGIMS said the uncertainty that people were experiencing ever since lockdown was put in place had left a huge impact on the mental health.

In numbers, he said, this translated to more than 150 patients on a daily basis who come for treatment at the institute. “In pre-Covid-19 period, the number of patients in emergency services was between 10 and 15,” he added.

According to him, “This is a matter of concern, as we are yet to start our regular OPDs due to Covid-19 crisis, but patients are rushing to get emergency treatment.”

Dr Gupta also said he often gets calls from patients, who tell him that they have developed corona phobia and want to come out of it.

One the reasons, he said, is information overflux in the media. “This has created fear psychosis, which seems to be one of the many reasons behind the rise in anxiety level in people,” added Dr Gupta. 

This situation is similar in Jind as well as many have approached the health department with mental health issues like suicidal thoughts, depression and insomnia that they faced during the Covid-19 lockdown.

According to Dr Sankalp, a psychiatrist in the Jind civil hospital, while in April, 143 cases were reported, in May, it increased sharply to 299.
