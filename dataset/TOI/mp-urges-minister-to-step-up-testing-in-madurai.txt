Madurai: Madurai MP, Su Venkatesan has written to the state minister for disaster management, R B Udayakumar urging him to take steps Covid-19 testing and screening in Madurai district.

In a statement on Thursday, he said that Madurai is lagging in Covid-19 prevention activities. According to statistics released by the state government two days ago, Madurai was in the 30th place among the districts in Covid-19 screening. “This is a matter of grave concern. The testing capacity was only half of that of Kanyakumari, which had a lesser population than Madurai,” he said.

As per the GO issued on May 31, the Tamil Nadu government has said that all people coming from Chennai, should be screened, even if they do not show symptoms. 

A media report said that 20,000 people have come from Chennai to Madurai in the last 10 days. The district administration has details of those people who came with proper e-passes, but they have not been screened properly.

Twenty-seven people who had come from Dubai on June 4, had been allowed to go to their houses, after a five-day quarantine in the government facility and no screening was done on the fifth day. 

“A pandemic is not the time to use connections to escape from quarantine and the district administration and government should step up the testing and screening,” Venkatesan said.
