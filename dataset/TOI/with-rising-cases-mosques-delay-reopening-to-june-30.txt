PANAJI: Mosques in the state will open from June 30, instead of June 8 due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Goa since June 1.

The association of Muslim jamats issued an advisory on Saturday asking mosques across the state to delay the reopening till month-end.

Masjid committee members and heads of jamats of masjids across the state have been directed to follow the advisory which is “issued keeping in mind the rapid spread of Covid-19 positive cases in the state and halt it from becoming a community transmission”.

Committee members of mosques across the state have been requested to adhere to guidelines issued by the association in a previous advisory to offer the regular five times namaz from home, including the jumma (Friday) namaz.

“The guidelines shall be followed till the end of June 30,” the advisory stated.

The advisory also requested members of the community to pray for the safety of frontline health workers, paramedical staff and the police who are working during the pandemic.

The MHA advisory was issued after the government’s decision to unlock the country after an almost two-month lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. It had advised all attendees to download the Aarogya Setu app and follow strict social distancing norms and other preventive measures.
