Thrissur: The last rites of Dinny Chacko from Chalakkudy who died of Covid-19 on Tuesday, are getting delayed following objections from the local church. Chacko returned from Maldives by ship on May 16, and was under treatment at the Thrissur medical college hospital (TMCH), where he breathed his last 

According to the Chalakkudy tahsildar E N Raju, relatives of Chacko approached St Sebastian Church, Thachudaparambu, his parish church, requesting permission to bury his body.

The church was currently using burial vaults and health authorities said they cannot be used for burying Covid-19 patients, the tahsildar said. Chacko’s relatives and health and revenue officials requested the church authorities to allocate land in the cemetery for deep burying as per Covid-19 protocol.

The church authorities denied citing floods in 2018 and 2019 inundating the area. Covid patients’ bodies have to be buried in 10-12ft pits and here a 5-6ft pit would be full of water, Raju said.

Subsequently, a proposal to cremate the body at Chalakkudy municipal crematorium and bring the ashes to the church for last rites was put forward, municipal councillor Shiji Valippan said. However, the relatives turned down the proposal.
