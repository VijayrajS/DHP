2020-06-13
UDAIPUR: As the world battles a pandemic, the humble sewing machine is making a comeback. For years, the sewing machine has been a handy tool for homemakers to fix wear and tear in clothes. However, in times of crisis, the machine is giving hope to many and has emerged as a symbol of self-reliance. In Udaipur, the sewing machine is helping many young girls and women to use their skills, creativity and business sense towards becoming self-reliant and leading a life of dignity. 

Many students who did diploma courses in fashion merchandising and readymade garments or textile designing from the Mohanlal Sukhadia University (MLSU) here, have set up their own start-up ventures and are earning repute as well as good income. “The professional course aims at making the learners self-reliant so that they can start their own outlets of designer clothes that are much in demand these days. They are taught about the fabric dynamics, marketing strategies to sell their products as well as bringing transformation in old clothes. The students are doing fairly well,” says Dolly Gandhi, in-charge of the department of readymade garments at MLSU. “I have always been fond of stitching and my passion led me to take up the course. It has given wings to my dreams of becoming a fashion designer and even work from the convenience of my home to earn a good income. While many lost their jobs during the lockdown, I managed to grab bulk orders for masks and earned monetary rewards as well as mental satisfaction,” says Talab Parveen, an entrepreneur.

 “I have learnt to handle fabrics, identify their quality. I also learned to make other fashion accessories and fabric products like cushion covers etc. I have quite a number of clients who really like my ideas and products and they want me to design their dresses on special occasions,” says Shaheen, a budding fashion designer who runs her boutique.
