SURAT: Family of the 21-year-old Ghod Dod Road woman, who was the first COVID-19 positive case in Gujarat, has breathed a sigh of relief. 

The woman’s samples tested negative in the second report, indicating that she was on the path to recovery.

The health department team collected samples of the woman on Friday and the results come out on Saturday. Now, the third test will be conducted after one day and if the test turns out to be negative, she will be brought out from isolation.

"The family members are relieved as they got the good news. They are not only happy as the woman is out of danger but their home quarantine will also end now," said a senior health official of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC).

"It’s a big relief for the city, health officials, doctors and the hospital staff too who are treating her. We will get her third test on Sunday or Monday after which it will be clear if she is free from the infection," said the official.

The woman had returned from London on March 14 and admitted in New Civil Hospital after developing symptoms of coronavirus on March 16. She was put in isolation and her family members were quarantined. However, none of them tested positive.
