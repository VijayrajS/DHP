Panaji: Goacan has urged director of panchayats Narayan Gad to make use of village development committees, which have been formed in all 190 panchayats, to help create awareness in order to help contain the spread of Covid-19 in villages.

“Every panchayat has set up its village development committee and its members have been given comprehensive training through Goa institute of public administration and rural development (GIPARD) over the last four years,” Goacan coordinator Roland Martins said. tnn
