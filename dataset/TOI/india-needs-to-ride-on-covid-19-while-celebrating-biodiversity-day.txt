‘India needs to ride on Covid-19 while celebrating biodiversity day’
2020-05-21
Nagpur: Even as International Biodiversity Day (IBD) will be celebrated on May 22 online, wildlife and biodiversity experts have appealed for the need to ride on the Covid-19 pandemic situation while celebrating the event.

“While celebrating the event, the governments should think of the emerging threats to our rich biodiversity while lifting the lockdown,” said Kishor Rithe, former member of Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB).

The state forest department has organized the event via webinar to be opened by PCCF SC Gairola. MSBB member-secretary Jeet Singh will speak about the status of biodiversity and people’s biodiversity registers (PBRs).

This year’s theme of IBD is ‘Our solutions are in nature’ and the celebrations are confined to online campaigns only. The protected areas and even biodiversity hotspots play an important role in reducing the risk of disasters, including pandemics.

“Many ayurvedic medicines can even help to fight Covid-19, which shows that solutions for human health are also available in nature. However, the existence of Indian ayurveda will depend upon how our systematic efforts bend the curve of biodiversity loss in India,” says Rithe. 

“As we are trying to recover from the pandemic and entire biodiversity on planet earth is right now healing very fast, we must ensure the activities harming biodiversity should not start again. Covid-19 has clearly shown that hereafter only biodiversity on earth is going to help humankind to survive on this planet,” said Rithe. 

Another expert & former member-secretary of MPSBB Dr Ram Gopal Soni said, “If all SBBs in the country apply access and benefit sharing (ABS) provisions under the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and Rules 2004, they can get more than Rs1,000 crore annually.”

“This money can be utilized to protect biodiversity, rivers, forest wildlife, and medicinal plants,” he added.
