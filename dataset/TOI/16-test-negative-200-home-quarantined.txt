PANAJI: In an update on the Covid-19 health situation, the directorate of health services (DHS) said that on Sunday 16 suspects tested negative for the virus while 66 reports were awaited. Twenty-three samples were sent for testing and 200 home quarantined.


Goa has seven confirmed Covid-19 cases all under treatment at the ESI hospital at Margao. “All patients have responded well to treatment. Only one required ventilator support,” a health official said.

The GMC has 28 suspects under treatment in its isolation ward. It proposes to have two more wards to treat patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and who tested negative for coronavirus, the official said.

There are 45 persons in the quarantine facility. The official said that among those quarantined on Sunday are some co-passengers of the two men who tested positive during the last two days. The DHS had appealed to the two men’s co-passengers to home quarantine themselves.
