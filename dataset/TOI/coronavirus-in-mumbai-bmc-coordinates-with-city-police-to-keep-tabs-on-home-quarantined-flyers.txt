Coronavirus in Mumbai: BMC coordinates with city police to keep tabs on home-quarantined flyers
2020-03-23
MUMBAI: The BMC from Saturday began informing the city police about air passengers who were put in home quarantine, in order to keep tabs on them. The police have been asked not to share this information with these citizens’ housing societies, fearing they might be ostracised. Housing societies are also being informed about their members who have tested positive for coronavirus.

A deputy municipal commissioner said that the civic body does not share information about contagious diseases with the public as it affects their social equations.

An official said, “If a person is infected with the virus, unknowingly he/she must have touched various things while moving around in the society through which the virus can spread. One should keep this in mind and remain at home till the end of the month for their safety.”

On Saturday, a list of such home-quarantined people prepared by the BMC was shared with local police stations. One such list was circulated among locals in a western suburb ward, which civic officials refused to comment on. They said that the list was not meant for the public.

The BMC has created a database of home-quarantined flyers that passed through the airport and decided to use software to interact with them on a daily basis. The civic body will ask them about any change in their health condition to decide on whether they need to be admitted to a hospital. The police are also in the process of tracking home-quarantined passengers through GPS.
