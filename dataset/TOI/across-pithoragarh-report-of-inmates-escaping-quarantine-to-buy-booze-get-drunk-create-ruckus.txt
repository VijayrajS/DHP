Pithoragarh: District authorities are investigating an allegation that residents who worked in different parts of the country and have recently returned to Pithoragarh, are using government schools and other government buildings where they have been institutionally quarantined, as “recreation centres”. They are consuming liquor there, and in some cases, indulging in drunken brawls at the centres, creating problems for other inmates .

On Wednesday night, some people were reported to have created a ruckus after consuming liquor at Tourist Rest House (TRH) Munsyari, which currently houses 44 people in institutional quarantine.

Earlier the same day, two inebriated inmates tried to escape from the quarantine centre by jumping from the first floor of the TRH, said Arif Khan, SHO of Munsyari police station. One of them fractured a leg and was sent to Pithoragarh for treatment, he added. An FIR was lodged against both for violating quarantine protocol, and investigation is on to find how they have been acquiring the liquor, Khan said. The baggage of the inmates wasn’t frisked at the time they were quarantined at the TRH, so it’s possible they had carried the liquor with them.”

On Thursday, nodal officer of Gangolihat Government Inter College, had also lodged a complaint at Gangolihat police station against 11 quarantined people.
