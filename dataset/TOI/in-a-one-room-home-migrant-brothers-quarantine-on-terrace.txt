GORAKHPUR: When Achchelal (30) and his brother Shri Ram (32) returned from Delhi and were asked to remain in home quarantine for 14 days, they did not know how this would be possible in a single-room home of seven-member family. Hence, the brothers are forced to stay at the terrace of their house under a tarpauline for the quarantine period, while their parents, children and wives occupy the only room the house has.

The brothers worked at a utensil factory in Delhi and returned home on May 9 after covering an 800-km journey partly on foot and partly through lifts on trucks. They were sent to home quarantine after thermal screening by local administration.

Their family has installed a pedestal fan on the terrace for the two brothers but the fan does not do much to keep the scorching May heat at bay. However, the brothers don’t complain and are looking forward to the end of quarantine. “We can’t put our family at risk. It is just a matter of 14 days, and this is nothing compared to the struggle we faced in Delhi after the lockdown,” said Achchelal.

DM Vijyendra Pandian said, “Those who don’t have enough rooms for home quarantine, may contact the administration. We will make arrangements for them.”
