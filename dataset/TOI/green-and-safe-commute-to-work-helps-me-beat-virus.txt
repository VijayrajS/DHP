Green and safe commute to work helps me beat virus
2020-06-10
I used to travel by bus. Now I am cycling to my workplace and I am feeling myself blessed, seeing the number of commuters stranded on roads while going to office and returning home. I love cycling. But I could not cycle to my office, thanks to restriction on bicycling on several roads of the city. I had to pay fines couple of times. But now, I think the government is also encouraging people to use cycles. I hope that the state government will ear-mark a bicycle lane for the safety of cyclists.

Not I am travelling with an enviable ease and comfort, I am feeling healthier. Since I cycle 10km in one way, I have managed to shed extra weight. I used to take sleeping pill sometimes. Now I am having sound sleep throughout the night. If people do cycling, they can stay physically fit.
