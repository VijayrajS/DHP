Board games become popular in the city during lockdown
2020-05-20
The lockdown has lead to a record rise in the sale of board games, so much so that they’re out of stock at several stores. Big Bazaar, Snapdeal and Paytm Mall recorded the highest-ever sales of board games once the government allowed sale of non-essential items in some markets. According to The Economic Times, Big Bazaar sold out its stock of board games after selling over 20,000 units of ludo and another 3,000 units of carrom boards.

BOARD GAMES KEEP FAMILIES ENTERTAINED, HELP KILL TIME
Right now, people are turning to board games to spend time with their family. Stand-up comedian Amit Tandon tells us, “We are at home, and to kill time, my wife, two teenage kids and I are playing board games.” 
For homemaker Seema Jain, it’s a throwback to her childhood days. She says, “Playing together at home is quite addictive – it feels like we are back to the summer vacations of our childhood. My 19-year-old son told me he spent two days watching videos to understand the key strategies of these games. In fact, since I always win, he was complaining that I didn’t share my game-winning strategies with him! Whatever board games we had were birthday gifts, but now, I’ve bought some more.”



‘DIDN'T WANT MY KIDS PLAYING GAMES ON MOBILE’
“I didn’t approve of my kids playing games on the mobile, so I pulled out an old multi-board game which had been lying in my house and encouraged them to play with that. So now the whole family sits together and plays these board games,” shares Vibhuti Srivastava,a homemaker in Aliganj.

HUGE DEMAND FOR BOARD GAMES 
Rakesh Goel, owner of a general merchant store in Aliganj says, “The demand for board games has increased in these past two months. People have also asked me to do a home-delivery of these games.”
