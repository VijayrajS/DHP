Health dept, AIIMS to begin rapid antibody-based blood tests for COVID-19

Bhopal: Taking heed of the ICMR advisory, the health department and AIIMS-Bhopal are to soon begin rapid antibody-based blood tests for COVID-19. The strategy of the testing would focus on areas reporting a high number of COVID-19 cases. 

Currently, asymptomatic people are not tested unless they have come in contact with a corona-positive patient. Cases of influenza-like illness are monitored in the health facilities. Any surge in cases is brought to the notice of the surveillance officer or CMHO for additional investigation. In such cases, at the facility level, symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals are to be tested using rapid antibody tests, said an official.

If the antibody test is negative and the patient — depending on his/her condition — is ‘likely to be non-COVID-19’ but with influenza-like illness, he/she is to be quarantined and observed for 10 days. If the antibody test is positive, there is possibility of recent infection and he/she has to be quarantined for another 10 days, going by the ICMR protocol.

Antibody test can also be useful for those on the field and working on the frontline. Experts, however, warn that even though reliable, rapid tests are mostly indicative of the virus. But it would not mean that rapid antibody-based blood test for COVID-19 will pick up every case of the virus. A person at the very start of their COVID-19 infection or with relatively low levels of the virus may show up as negative.
