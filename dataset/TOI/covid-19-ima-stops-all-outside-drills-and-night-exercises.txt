DEHRADUN: To fight the Covid-19 virus threat, the Indian Military Academy (IMA) has stopped all outside drills and night exercises of Gentlemen Cadets (GCs) who are in the midst of training modules at the academy.


So far, no case of suspected Covid-19 has been reported at the IMA where over 400 cadets, including from friendly foreign countries, are undergoing training in different courses. IMA sources said that the decision to rejig the training pattern was taken in wake of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country as a precautionary measure. 

Speaking to TOI, IMA spokesperson Lt Col Amit Dagar said, “We are following the instructions passed by the Centre and all gatherings and events have accordingly been stopped within the IMA premises. The GCs will not be taken out for exercises till further orders.”The GCs are usually taken outdoors for specialised training drills such as mountain climbing, long distance run, infantry mock battles and night patrolling drill in hills. “All the outdoor drills and exercise of GCs have been stopped till further notice. The main idea is to have minimum contact with others,” said the spokesperson.

Also, GCs are being taught in small groups to minimise chances of spreading of infection. IMA sources said that all GCs have been given a special awareness lecture on Covid-19 and their health is being monitored by a team of doctors.
