Surat: In a bid to curb the spread of deadly Covid-19 virus, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has decided to impose a fine upto Rs 25,000 and initiate legal action against those who violate the home quarantine protocol.

On Friday, four people were shifted to the government quarantine facility after they disobeyed the home quarantine orders, Surat collector Dhaval Patel said. As many as 527 people have been ordered home quarantine in the city. 

The city recorded its first positive case of coronavirus on Thursday.

SMC has also issued a notice stating that the people who have returned from foreign tours are required to inform on the toll free number 18001238000 and fill up the self declaration form available on the municipal corporationâ€™s website. 

The scare of coronavirus was visible with thin presence of people on the roads in the otherwise glitzy city. The authorities began strictly implementing the prohibitory orders banning assembly of four or more people in public places.

SMC closed down more than 1,800 establishments across the city including shopping malls, cinema halls, party plots, hotels, gardens, restaurant, dance classes, tuition classes etc. operating in all the seven municipal zones on Friday.

Meanwhile, the roads leading to Dumas, a popular hangout place for the Surtis, were deserted with entry of visitors banned at Dumas as well as Suvali beaches on Friday. But large number of people thronged the vegetable markets and grocery stores to purchase essential commodities on Friday.
