PUDUCHERRY: An 83-year-old man who tested positive for Covid-19 and had multiple health complications died in Puducherry on Thursday. He is the first Puducherry resident to die in the Union territory after testing positive for Covid-19.


The man from Muthialpet was undergoing treatment at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute (IGMC).

Director of health and family welfare service S Mohankumar said the man was admitted to the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital with high blood pressure, cardiac complications and clots in the brain on June 9. He was shifted to IGMC after testing positive for Covid-19. The man did not respond to treatment.

Mohankumar said all the 47 healthcare workers in the general hospital and the medical college, who had treated the patient, have tested negative.

On Thursday, 12 people - 10 from Puducherry and two from Mahe - tested positive for Covid-19 taking the total number of cases reported in the Union territory to 157.

At present, there are 88 active cases. Forty-two patients are undergoing treatment at Jipmer, 40 at IGMC and four in Mahe Government General Hospital.

Health minister Malladi Krishna Rao said the government would take a call on imposing stringent lockdown measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 after reviewing measures taken by neighbouring Tamil Nadu.
