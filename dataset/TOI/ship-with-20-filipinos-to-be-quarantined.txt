MUMBAI: A Philippines-registered container ship, M V Collao, with 20 crew on board, all Filipino nationals, will be quarantined in Dahanu when it arrives early on Saturday for suspected Covid-19.


Palghar district collector Dr Kailash Shinde confirmed the carrier, which left Singapore a few days ago, is expected to reach Dahanu port on Saturday. “A medical team will be sent on board the ship to check the crew. They will be quarantined for around a fortnight.” The last port of call of the ship, carrying coal for Adani Dahanu Thermal Power Station, was Qingdao, China, in mid-January. 

Meanwhile, 12 persons from the district, who returned from abroad, were tested. Eight were told to stay at home and two discharged. tnn
