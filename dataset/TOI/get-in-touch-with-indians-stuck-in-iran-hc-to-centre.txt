2020-03-13
NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Thursday ordered the central government to ensure that the Indian embassy in Iran gets in touch with stranded Indian students, in the wake of coronavirus outbreak. It said instead of “merely issuing advisories”, the government must “do a little more” to evacuate over 3,000 Indian nationals, including pilgrims, fishermen and students, stranded in Iran.

On its part, Centre said that mass evacuation was not possible as Iran had banned all commercial flights from February 26. Secondly, the Centre said, those stranded had to be tested for the fast spreading virus before they could be brought back to the country.

The government admitted there was no local support on the ground from Iranian authorities and it took several rounds of negotiations before Indian scientists were allowed to set up a lab there to draw samples from Indian citizens.

The Iranian government only recently allowed an Indian Air Force aircraft to evacuate 58 nationals, including 25 women and two children, the central government stated.

Assuring the court that the local embassy was in contact with Indian nationals in Iran and advisories had been issued to them on following the health protocols issued by WHO, the government said that embassy officials were travelling to all the locations where Indians were stranded to assure them of all possible assistance for their safe and early return.

The court, however, remarked that merely issuing advisories was not going to help. “You know where students are. You have to contact them. Not doing so won’t be tolerated. Get in touch with them and give a report by March 17,” it noted.
