Coronavirus epidemic could hurt hotel occupancy in summer

AHMEDABAD: While travel to international destinations is expected to curtailed due to the novel coronavirus epidemic, hoteliers in Ahmedabad are also concerned about a decline in occupancy this summer for the same reason.


Industry estimates suggest that after March, occupancy in city hotels is largely driven by corporate clients, from India and abroad.

“Due to the coronavirus epidemic, it is likely that foreign business travellers will defer trips. Corporate and business travellers drive business in the summer, which is typically the lean season. It could thus affect business,” said Sandeepan Bosh, general manager, Radisson Blu Ahmedabad.

Industry sources said that occupancy levels and average daily tariff at hotels in Ahmedabad declines in the summer, i.e. from mid-March onwards.

Hoteliers are pinning their hopes on domestic travellers. 

“International travel is expected to be affected by the the coronavirus epidemic. This could lead Indians to travel to domestic destinations and people visiting Gujarat will first travel to Ahmedabad. This may be the saving grace for hotel occupancy in the state,” said Narendra Somani, president, Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association (FHRA), Gujarat.
