Covid-19 forces short-term policy to aid tourism
2020-04-29
Mysuru: Tourism minister C T Ravi on Tuesday said his department is planning a short-term policy to provide immediate support to the tourism sector which is hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Ravi said survival and revival are the two major challenges before the ailing industry. “This is an extraordinary situation; so extraordinary measures are required. Our immediate goal is to revive the sector. For that, the Covid-19 tourism policy will be framed,” he told TOI.

Ravi admitted that the Mysuru Dasara celebrations could be scaled down if the lockdown continues beyond May 3. “A final decision on the celebrations will be taken after consultation with all the stakeholders, including the chief minister, Mysuru district minister and district administration,” he said.

Mysuru Dasara is a major tourist attraction in the state with lakhs visiting the city during the festival season spanning two months. The tourism department wanted to start preparing for the festival in March, but the Covid-10 lockdown poured cold water on its plans.

At a video conference on Monday, Ravi said the stakeholders’ requests like tax relief, support for cab drivers, relief from payments including loan instalment are under review. BS Prashanth, honorary president of Mysuru Travels Association, said the government needs to protect the interests of skilled manpower in the sector.
