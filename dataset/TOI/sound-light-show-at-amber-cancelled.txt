2020-03-17
JAIPUR: The light-and-sound show at Amber Fort has been cancelled from Tuesday in the wake of coronavirus. Visitors, however, can still visit the monument.


The foreign tourist footfall to the monument, which remained unaffected till March 14, has now started to decline. On March 14, 826 foreign tourists visited the monument against 1,445 the previous day.

Even though the virus fears spread after an Italian couple tested positive on March 3 and visa suspension was imposed later, that had no immediate impact on visitors to the 16th century monument as footfall ranged between 1,100 and 1,400.

But authorities said the onset of summer and the visa suspension had started impacting the footfall and the foreign tourist numbers could fall further.

As far as domestic tourists was concerned, the numbers had begun declining from 5,749 on March 1 to 3,412 on March 14. 

The number of domestic tourists generally decline in March due to exams. And also the summer season has its own impact on the numbers.

With the light-and-sound show being cancelled, the number of visitors are expected to fall further.
