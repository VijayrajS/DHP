2020-02-07
AHMEDABAD: Police in the city on Wednesday afternoon booked eight hawkers, who earlier did business near Law Garden, at what will soon become a designated food vending area called ‘Happy Street’, for protesting against the AMC for displacing them. 

Navrangpura police officials said the hawkers had been booked for organizing a protest without police permission and had been detained under Section 188 of the IPC. A similar incident took place on Thursday, and resulted in a fracas between an encroachment removal team of AMC and police officials, and protesting hawkers near Vastrapur lake.

V A Parmar, sub-inspector of Law Garden chowky in the FIR stated that they had been deployed in bandobust to remove encroachments from ‘Happy Street’ when a group of 30-35 hawkers, waving banners against the AMC arrived from Navrangpura and began airing their grievances in public.

They had no permission to organize a protest and were detained, said a police official. “Rakesh, the president of All-India Hawkers Union was detained along with Alpesh, Paresh Dayaram, Bharat Tolaji, Manubhai Bhupatsinh, Premkumar Ramprasad, Dinesh Bhavan and Satish Nekram,” said a police official.

At Vastrapur lake, cops and officials of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) faced stiff opposition from hawkers when they set out to remove encroachments in the area on Thursday morning. Some 50 hawkers, including women, gathered at the spot and resisted the efforts of the cops and AMC officials. 

Some of them allegedly abused the cops and got into scuffles with them.

As police reinforcement were called in, the hawkers dispersed. Police booked 14 people, including the leader of the group, Rakesh Maheriya, and six women.

“Two of our policemen suffered minor injuries. We have booked 14 persons under Sections 186, 323, 332, 143, 147 and 149 of the IPC,” said a police official.
