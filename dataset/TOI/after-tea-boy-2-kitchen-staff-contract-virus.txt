2020-06-14
Panaji: Following the tea boy at the Covid hospital testing positive, two kitchen staff at the ESI hospital have also tested positive. Sources said the tea boy contracted the virus because although he was supposed to collect the tea from the kitchen and place it on tables for patients under a particular system followed at the hospital, he was found entering wards.

The two kitchen staff at the ESI hospital are suspected to have picked up the infection from the tea boy. In the ESI quarters, a family staying opposite the tea boy’s flat has also tested positive. Officials said that his children used to play with the neighbour’s children. While the neighbour’s mother also works at the ESI hospital, she used to stay away from the family at the hotel accommodation provided. Half of the ESI staff got their results on Friday and the other half will receive the results on Sunday. tnn
