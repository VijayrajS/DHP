Muzaffarnagar: After pasting copies of FIRs on their doors, police in UP’s Muzaffarnagar are now publicly shaming those found violating lockdown in the district by announcing their names over loudspeakers.

On Sunday night, scores of policemen using the public address system announced name of a man who has been accused of roaming on streets. “A man, Ravi (name changed) living in your area is flouting lockdown. We have registered a case against him and an FIR copy has been pasted on his house’s wall. He is creating a nuisance which is harmful for the society,” a policeman announced in New-Mandi area.

A police officer said that it is being done to ensure that “the entire neighbourhood gets to know about his irresponsible behaviour.” Interestingly, some locals recorded the public announcement over their phones and put it on social media platforms.

On Sunday, local police “home-delivered” the copies of 63 FIRs at the door steps of 275 people booked for violating lockdown. Upping the ante against the lockdown violators, local police has now decided to not only register but also home-deliver FIRs to offenders based on video footage and CCTV surveillance.

As many as 1,800 people who were caught breaking lockdown here have been booked. 

SSP Muzaffarnagar Abhishek Yadav said, “We want to make people stay at their homes. There is a complete lockdown, but some people are being spotted on streets.”
