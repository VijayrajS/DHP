Shut OPDs worry non-coronavirus patients
2020-03-24
LUCKNOW: Non-coronavirus patients, who visited six hospitals designated for the treatment of Covid-19 cases, had a tough time on Monday when they found the general OPDs closed.


Patients, who came from far off places and returned disappointed, said it was good that the administration was serious in its fight against coronavirus but it should not ignore general patients. They said instead of closing OPDs for general patients, hospital authorities could set up OPDs for Covid-19 patients in separate buildings.

General OPDs have been shut at SGPGI, KGMU, Balrampur Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), SPM Civil Hospital and Lok Bandhu Hospital.

More than 4,000 patients report at KGMU’s general OPDs while SGPGIMS receives at least 2,000 patients on a daily basis. On an average, RMLIMS receives 1,500 patients, Balrampur Hospital gets 2,000 while Civil Hospital and Lok Bandhu Hospital get 1,000 and 500 patients daily. These hospitals have decided to admit only suspected/confirmed Covid-19 cases and offer emergency and super-specialty services.

Shahbaz Alam (32) from Hardoi, who visited SGPGIMS to get his pregnant wife examined by a super specialist, said: “My wife was admitted to KGMU where doctors told us that the unborn baby is suffering from a deformity in heart which could also be dangerous for the mother. They referred her to SGPGIMS but new OPD registrations are not being made here. I don’t know where to go now.” “Doctors in Sitapur referred my father to KGMU as they could not diagnose his problem which is constantly aggravating. I cannot afford a private hospital,” he added.

Sushil Singh, who visited KGMU for follow-up treatment of her sister who had a surgery recently, said: “We wanted to see the doctor as she is still feeling pain. We were not allowed to enter OPD.” Similar situation prevailed at Balrampur, RMLIMS and SPM Civil hospitals.
