Child marriages go on despite lockdown in Andhra Pradesh
2020-05-13
VIJAYAWADA: While the lockdown has ensured a fall in the number of crimes in general, child marriages in Andhra Pradesh seem to be on an upward curve. Many feel that with the police busy and officials tending to various duties, they could get away with child marriages. The woman development and child welfare department (WD&CW) has prevented as many as 165 child marriages in the state between March 25 and May 11.


WD&CW director Kritika Shukla said that of the 165 complains of child marriages, Anantapur district reported the highest number of complaints —46, followed by Srikakulam—34. Krishna district reported 13 cases and Visakhapatnam 9 cases.



Most of these child marriages were stopped upon intervention by authorities. In some cases, once the marriage is stopped, the children are not willing to stay with their parents. In such cases, the children are produced before child welfare committees (CWC). Based on CWC’s orders, the children are taken to Kasturba Balika Vidyalayas or Swadhar homes, the director said.

In Srikakulam recently, a villager alerted officials that an underage girl was being married off secretly. When officials reached the village and enquired, the girl’s parents claimed that their daughter was above marriageable age. But an enquiry by officials revealed that the girl was a minor and the marriage was stopped. 

Sources say that with people restricted to their homes and officials on Covid-19 duty, people may have thought that they could get away with child marriages without getting caught. But Angandwadi workers, Childline, child marriage prevention officers and local police have together managed to prevent such marriages. 

 Anganwadi workers are tracking the cases with the help of Ward Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarshi. Moreover, ICDS supervisors and child marriage prevention officers are monitoring cases and counselling parents.
