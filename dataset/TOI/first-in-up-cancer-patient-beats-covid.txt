Total five patients were discharged on Friday.

“It is UP’s first case of a cancer patient being successfully treated for Covid-19. Recovery of patients with comorbidities is a moral booster,” vice-chancellor Prof MLB Bhatt said.

“Cancer patients have low immunity, hence we took all possible care during treatment,” said KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh. The patient had received radiotherapy in KGMU in 2019 under Dr Singh. “It came as a relief to see patients at an advanced age of cancer and high comorbidities can also beat the virus,” he added.

“The patient had mild cough and gastroenteritis. He had difficulty in eating due to cancer, but we managed everything,” said incharge Covid-19 unit Dr D Himanshu. The patient is a resident of a hotspot area of Sadar. “I wasn’t scared when I was told that I have the virus. I packed my clothes and left for the hospital,” he told TOI over phone. “The staff was good to all of us. I am relieved to be back home,” he added.

“I had no symptoms and my swab sample were taken thrice and every time it came negative, but then I received a call from the officials that I was positive and should be isolated,” he said.

The two heart patients, who recoveredon Friday included a 70-year-old male from Kaiserbagh and a 56-year-old female resident from Sadar area.
