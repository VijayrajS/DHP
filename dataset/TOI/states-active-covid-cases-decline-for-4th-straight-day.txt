2020-05-29
Bhubaneswar: The number of active Covid-19 cases showed a downward trend for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday, with recoveries exceeding fresh positive cases by a significant margin.

While 67 people tested positive for the virus on Thursday, 75 recovered and were discharged from hospital. With this, the number of active cases in the state decreased to 766 from 881 on Monday, 861 on Tuesday and 774 on Wednesday. The number of persons cured stands at 887, while the death toll remains seven.

Stating that Odisha’s efforts to contain Covid had been recognised by all, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday said, “The Covid mortality rate in the state is one of the lowest in the country and the world. Besides, more than 50% of the infected people have recovered and gone home. It is indeed a major achievement for a state like Odisha and its people. Powerful nations of the world and rich states of our country have not been able to achieve this feat in the fight against Covid.”

Although the number of infected people has risen to 1,660, the state’s recovery rate has improved to 53.43% compared to the national average of 42.7%. The figure was 34.36% just a week ago, on May 21. The state’s mortality rate is 0.42%, the lowest among states that have reported more than 1,000 cases. The national average death rate is 2.86%.

“We hope the steady decline in number of active cases continues. Most of the positive people continue to be asymptomatic,” additional chief secretary (health) Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra said.

According to updates on the government’s Covid dashboard, new positive cases were reported from Ganjam (26), Jajpur and Khurda (11 each), Nayagarh (7), Sonepur (4), Balangir, Jagatsinghpur and Sambalpur (2 each) and Keonjhar and Bargarh (one each).
