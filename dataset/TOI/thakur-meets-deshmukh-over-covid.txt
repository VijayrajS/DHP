Amravati: Concerned by the ever growing number of covid-19 positive cases in the city, Maharashtra Minister for Women and Child Development and guardian minister of the district, Adv Yashomati Thakur, called on veteran politician and ex-MLC, Prof B T Deshmukh, and sought his guidance and advice on the possible ways and means to control the spread of coronavirus which had infected 53 persons, including ten deaths.

“I discussed the situation with him (Deshmukh) and issued instructions to the administration to act accordingly,” Thakur told TOI.

“I asked the administration to do micro planning for high risk and low risk areas and intensify the survey and health check up drives,” said Thakur.

She added that remedial measures taken were discussed. “Deshmukh asked me to focus more on the Red Zone by dividing it into high risk and low risk areas and also to intensify health check up drives. He suggested effective implementation of preventive measures for high risk areas through deployment of necessary squads, health check ups, information about suspects and collection of their throat swabs,” said Thakur.
