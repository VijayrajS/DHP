India far away from Covid-19 peak: ICMR
2020-06-03
NEW DELHI: With timely and effective interventions, India has managed to keep the number of coronavirus cases and fatalities low and is far away from the peak of Covid-19 spread, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said, underlining that the country had positioned itself better than other nations. 



“India has been very good at reducing mortality. You will get to see the data in a week,” ICMR scientist Nivedita Gupta said. Asked if India has entered the community transmission phase, Gupta said, “Instead of using the word community transmission, it is important to understand the extent of spread of the disease and where we stand in comparison with other countries.”

She said ICMR is conducting a sero-survey of almost 34,000 people to assess the extent of spread of Covid-19. The results will be out by the end of this week or early next week.
