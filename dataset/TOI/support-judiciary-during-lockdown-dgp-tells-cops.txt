2020-05-01
Visakhapatnam: The office of the director general of police (DGP) has issued a notice on the obstructions faced by the judicial staff from the police while attending to their official duties during the lockdown period. 

The DGP has noted that instances have occured where police have behaved impolitely with the judicial staff, made needless comments causing much embarrassment at higher quarters.

“The district superintendents of police and commissioners of police are requested to get in touch with the district judges and ascertain the nature of court functioning and take measures during the lockdown period to ensure that court staff are not obstructed and inconvenienced in any manner from attending to their duties and court work is not hampered,” stated the notice.

President of Forum of Legal Professionals Kuppili Muralidhar said, “Even since the lockdown, the courts have been functioning with minimal staff and attending to only important cases. For some urgent work like bail applications, the judicial staff may need to go to the court. The police should strictly adhere to the notice and ensure hassle-free movement of staff.”
