Dehradun: Uttarakhand has witnessed a significant slump in the number of road accidents and consequent deaths in April, compared to the same period in 2019, which is being attributed to the lockdown imposed since end-march

According to the data issued by state police department, the hill state recorded just 12 cases of road accidents in April, compared to 107 cases in the same month last year —a drop of over 88%.

The casualties caused by road accidents have also declined by over 94% from April 1 to 30 compared to the same period last year. Just four road related fatalities have been reported in April in the entire state, while as many as 74 people lost their lives in road accidents in April 2019.

In April last year, 86 people had got injured in road accidents, compared to 17 last month, according to the police data.

Elaborating on the data, Ashok Kumar, director general (DG) law and order, said, "The obvious reason behind such a significant drop in number of accidents and fatalities is that people are staying indoors. Lockdown remained in force throughout April and is reflective in the accident figures."

Besides road accidents, crime cases have also witnessed a significant drop in the Himalayan state in April. Overall, police registered 522 cases of crime in April this year, compared to 853 in the same period last year, a drop of about 38%.

Rape cases have seen the biggest dip of 95% as two cases were registered in April this year, compared to 43 cases in April 2019. Other criminal cases have also declined in April compared to the same period last year—loot (70%), vehicle theft (100%), chain snatching (100%), theft (62%) and murder (20%). Kumar added, "As a result of the lockdown, maximum decline has been reported in outdoor crimes such as loot, vehicle theft, chain snatching and theft."
