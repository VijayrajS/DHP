Testing times as MCH facility works non-stop
2020-03-18
Thiruvananthapuram: A small team led by the Government Medical College Hospitalâ€™s department of microbiology has been working round the clock to test the large inflow of samples with primary and secondary contact numbers rising in the district. The facility, which opened on March 11, tested over 100 samples in the first five days. By Sunday, the team had completed testing of 135 samples.

With the administration opening new collection centres in the district, samples from these centres are being added to those from the corona clinic at MCH. Samples from private hospitals in the city are also being tested at the facility. 

The team is now equipped with confirmatory kits to deliver faster results; which means that the samples tested positive at the MCH lab need no longer be sent to the NIV facility in Alappuzha for confirmation. This is proving crucial especially as time is of the essence in preventing spread of the infection. 

The team, comprising research assistants, molecular biology scientists, technicians led by head of microbiology, are not even following specified duty hours simply due to sheer number of samples being handled. 

The technology used for detecting the virus is called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and tests are done using real-time PCR thermal cyclers/thermocyclers. 

On the opening day the team tested three samples, which soon jumped to 20-40 samples a day. 

What was initially a two-member team soon inducted two molecular scientists from the pathology department as sample numbers increased with each passing day. 

The first 10 samples and test results were sent to NIV Pune, which validated the test results and quality-control measures. This was a shot in the arm for the team. 

While a PCR machine can load 20 samples at a time, preparation takes 5 hours with loading taking 1.5 hours. It takes nearly 6.5 hours to get the result. The team then carries out a reconfirmation test which takes same amount of time. 

The team members wear personal protection kits while loading samples. 

All precautions taken by a doctor during treatment or collection of the swab specimen of an infected patient are followed in the lab as well. 

The team, which is already working overtime, knows that they are in for more challenging days ahead as more primary contacts are tracked down and samples are collected from latest cases.
