Six Covid-19 deaths in Vidarbha, all tested positive post-death
2020-04-24
NAGPUR: With two women who died in Amravati on April 20 testing positive for Covid-19 on April 22, death toll due to coronavirus in Vidarbha has gone up to six. These include three from Amravati and one each from Buldhana, Nagpur and Akola. 


There are several things common in these six deaths. None of the deceased had any known travel history. All died as Covid-19 suspects and were tested as confirmed positive case after death. All the diseased had comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, kidney problems or TB. All were above 40 years of age and died before test reports of their swab samples arrived. 

In other words, they died as Covid-19 suspects and not as confirmed patients. None of them was shifted to isolation. This also means that no Covid-19 patient has died till date in the region during treatment in isolation wards. The only exception to this is a 30-year-old youth, who committed suicide in Akola isolation ward after he came to know that he was detected Covid-19 positive. But, he committed suicide and had not died of Covid-19.

Five out of the six deaths are from Amravati division. “Three deaths are in Amravati and one each in Akola and Buldhana. Most of them were earlier treated in private hospitals,” said Dr Riyaz Faruqui, deputy director (health services), Amravati division.

“Our focus is on tracing high risk contacts of the deceased and detect positive patients at the earliest. Moving them to isolation wards will not only help breaking corona’s chain, but also ensure their condition remains stable and chances of recovery are more,” he added. 

Vidarbha has 125 active Covid-19 cases at present. No Covid-19 patient has ever died after being admitted in isolation ward for treatment. According to officials, more than 70% active cases in Vidarbha are asymptomatic and have all chances to recover.
