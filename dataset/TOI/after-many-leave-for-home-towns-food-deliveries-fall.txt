2020-03-18
PUNE: Food delivery partners across the city remained extremely busy till Sunday. On Monday, there was a big drop as Punekars opted for social distancing. On Tuesday, restaurateurs said deliveries fell by nearly 60%. 


Kunal Udane, owner of German Bakery, said, “Last week, food deliveries increased, though walk-ins reduced. However, on Monday, we noticed a significant drop in delivery orders as well.” 

Abhishek Shetty, owner of Kalinga Pure Veg, said, “Home delivery orders have dropped as people are wary.”

Fewer deliveries were visible on Tuesday as restaurants began closing. “Thousands have opted to go back to their home towns. This has hurt our business,” Shetty said.

After colleges shut, students from other cities have gone back home and hostels have emptied out affecting delivery orders, a restaurant employee said.

Spokespersons from online food ordering and delivery platforms, Zomato and Swiggy, said they have undertaken several measures in wake of the spurt in Covid-19 cases.

Both offered contactless delivery, where patrons can pay online, call them and request for the parcel to be dropped at the door.

A Swiggy representative said that masks have been provided to delivery executives and they are trained on respiratory hygiene practices, washing hands and identification of symptoms.

A company spokesperson from Zomato said, “We are using multiple channels of communication to sensitise our employees, users, restaurants as well as delivery partners.” 

Shetty said some restaurants are not able to pay the staff from other states whose families want them back. Many restaurants may close down as they do not have the money to pay for the hiked excise licence charges.
