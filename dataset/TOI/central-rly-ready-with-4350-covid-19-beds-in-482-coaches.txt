Nagpur: With spurt in novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection cases, the Central Railway has geared up by converting 482 coaches into isolation/quarantine wards with nearly 4,350 beds for patients in Maharashtra.

The Indian Railways has already started converting 5,000 coaches to accommodate 3.2 lakh such beds. Central Railway was given a target of 482 coaches. With 8-9 beds in one coach, it is ready with around 4,350 beds.

According to Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer (CPRO), Central Railway, out of the 482 coaches, 50% have been converted into isolation/quarantine wards at two workshops — Matunga and Parel in Mumbai. “Rest of the coaches were converted at other coaching depots like Wadi-Bunder, LTT, Nagpur, Bhusawal and Solapur,” he added.

These coaches have been kept in stand by in five divisions — Nagpur, Mumbai, Bhusawal, Solapur and Pune — and will be made available as demanded by the district administration.

“In Nagpur, 35 coaches are ready at coaching depot. Besides, we have set up 125 beds at various places in Ajni and 25 at Central Railway Hospital. Both the places are near to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital (IGGMCH) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH),” said assistant commercial manager (ACM) SG Rao.

Sutar said, “Ideally, these coaches will be placed preferably where there is watering facility, availability of charging points, easy accessibility to nearest hospital and road connectivity.”

“We have achieved the target in given time. All team members and those who are involved in converting the coaches into isolation/ quarantine wards are real heroes of the battle against Covid-19,” Sutar told TOI.
