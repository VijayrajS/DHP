Vadodara: Seven people from Mumbai were booked at Waghodiya police station on Sunday for allegedly coming to Sangdol village in Waghodiya taluka of Vadodara district during lockdown.

Police said the accused are natives of Sangdol village and are settled in Bhayander of Mumbai. “We had received information from the sarpanch that seven people had arrived in the village on April 9 and so we went to check along with health workers,” said a police official. On being questioned, Babar Harijan, Ajay Harijan, Jitu Harijan, Satish Harijan, Indu Harijan, Sangita Harijan and Aarti Harijan said they had come to Sangdol on March 18.

“Travelling from one place to another place during lockdown is a punishable offence since it violates public notification. They did not have any evidence to support their claim that they had arrived in the village before lockdown came into effect and so we have lodged an offence against all of them,” the police official said. Cops have sought call detail records and mobile phone locations from mobile companies to ascertain their claims.
