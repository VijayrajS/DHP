2020-06-10
UDUPI: Health minister B Sriramulu on Tuesday indicated the state would no longer send returnees to institutional quarantine facilities and that these facilities would be reserved only for the poor and homeless.

Sriramulu said the state “has closed institutional quarantine facilities from Tuesday” and people who come from other states will be directed to remain in home quarantine.

“However, the poor, homeless, and those who stay in colonies will be kept in institutional facilities,” he said. Muzrai minister Kota Srinivas Poojari said food kits will be provided to the poor who are in home quarantine.

Sriramulu said district administrations have been given “complete authority” to seal residences of those in home quarantine.

“Neighbours will be informed. Once the house is sealed, the person will have to remain at home for 14 days,” Sriramulu said. “Cases will be booked against those who violate the rule and they will be shifted to institutional quarantine.” 

The minister clarified that the entire apartment building or complex will not be sealed, but only the flat in which the infected person lives. He said 1,100 people, who were in institutional quarantine in Udupi were sent home on Tuesday.

With cases rising in Udupi – it has 944 positive cases as on Tuesday – Sriramulu said the district hospital will be upgraded with 250 beds soon. Six specialized staffs have been provided to Koosamma Shambhu Shetty Haji Abdulla Government Mother and Child Hospital at Udupi, he added.
