CHENNAI: Faced with questions from opposition members in the state assembly on measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Greater Chennai Corporation swung into action on Friday.

The civic body improvised and used its mosquito-spraying devices and water wash vehicles to spray disinfectants at the secretariat in Fort St George, which also houses the state assembly.

A disinfectant was mixed with water in a 1:19 ratio and sprayed across the campus, on railings and stairs, a senior official said.

Sources said corporation commissioner G Prakash has initiated discussions to rent agricultural machines which spray pesticides and drones which would be able to spray disinfectants in case of any emergency where the health staff may not be able to reach.

Besides deploying vehicles, the corporation is gearing up to have ‘visible preventive measures’ so that people scared of the epidemic feel reassured, an official said. “These will soon be put into use at all major locations where there is dense movement of public,” the official said.

The pulse fog machine, in which the insecticide is mixed with diesel, is usually used to prevent mosquito breeding. Engineers found that it could be used with water and was pressed into service.

Sprayers are used for the same purpose and can disperse particulate matter of up to 20 microns. “This is usually helpful because the disinfectant droplets need to spread properly and act on spit or phlegm droplets which spread the virus,” a senior official said.

The mobile water wash is used to clean garbage vehicles of the civic body. It sprays tiny droplets of water with great force, something the corporation is using to spray disinfectant.
