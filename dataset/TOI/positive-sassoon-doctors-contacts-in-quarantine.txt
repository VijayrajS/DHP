Positive Sassoon doctor’s contacts in quarantine
2020-04-19
Pune: About 10 professional contacts and family members of the coronavirus positive chest physician from the Sassoon General Hospital have been quarantined since the case came to the fore on Wednesday.

Sassoon hospital dean Murlidhar Tambe said, “The high risk contacts of the physician (52) have been identified. All those with symptoms have been told to get tested immediately. High-risk contacts not displaying any symptoms have been told to isolate themselves.”

He said the high-risk asymptomatic contacts will be tested after a few days. 

President of the Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, Avinash Bhondwe told TOI that 212 doctors from across the state were either infected and admitted or in quarantine. “Some of the infected doctors have a private practice, while most others were treating Covid-19 patients. Nurses are also contracting the infection. If things continue this way, it will be a major blow for us,” he said. 

Bhondwe said there were four reasons why doctors were catching the virus. “There is an unavailability of standardized personal protective equipment for doctors. So, in desperation, doctors are using sub-standard PPE. Then till recently, there was no proper separation between Covid and non-Covid hospitals which led to greater cross-infection. Lastly, infection control at hospitals treating Covid-19 patients is not up to the mark,” he said.
