2020-02-18
Aurangabad: In the wake of the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVD-19) in China and a few suspected as well as confirmed cases in India, the Centre has requested all institutions of higher learning to sensitize students about preventive interventions to keep the virus at bay. 

“Such informed youth can be agents of change for the family, community and beyond,” stated the letter from the ministry of health addressed to the education department.

The Central authorities have also issued a special pamphlet carrying preventive measures.

Emphasizing upon the preventive measures, the Centre has recommended frequent hand washing, using handkerchief, tissue paper or sleeve of the shirt covering the upper arm while coughing or sneezing, staying away from college when sick and avoiding public gatherings in order to prevent/ reduce transmission of communicable diseases, including flu. 

“You are requested to take up with the state education departments, universities and other autonomous teaching institutions under your ministry to sensitize their students these simple public health measures that will go a long way in preventing spread of novel coronavirus,” stated the letter written by Preeti Sudan, secretary of the Union health ministry directed to the ministry of human resource development (MHRD). 

Acting on the directives from the MHRD, the state directorate of technical education (DTE) has asked all recognized institutions to spread necessary awareness to curb the transmission of communicable diseases. “The central authorities have provided informatory pamphlets in English and Hindi. These self-explanatory documents can be posted on notice boards and other prominent places on the campus,” said officials from the DTE. 

Ulhas Shiurkar, principal of Deogiri Institute of Engineering and Management, said that the outbreak of coronavirus should be used as an opportunity to spread awareness on prevention of communicable diseases. “We have closely witnessed the outbreak of swine flu (H1N1) in the recent past. Now, our neighbor is battling with coronavirus. Students must know basics to prevent communicable diseases and colleges should take holistic measures to spread knowledge about the same,” said Shiurkar.

The ministry of health has put out a helpline number +91-11-23978046 for any information related to coronavirus. The designated email id for seeking further information is isncov2019@gmail.com.
