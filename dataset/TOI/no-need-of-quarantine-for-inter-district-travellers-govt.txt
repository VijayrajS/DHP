Inter-district travellers don’t require quarantine: Rajasthan government
2020-05-16
JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday directed that there is no need for 14 days’ quarantine for those who travel from one district to another.

He said only those who have symptoms like cold and cough should be sent to quarantine centres. He also directed that those entrepreneurs and workers from other states who are travelling daily to industrial areas like Bhiwadi, Neemrana need not to be quarantined. The chief minister gave this direction at a review meeting held on Friday.

The chief minister said now people are wearing masks as part of their daily routine. This is a good sign as awareness about corona has increased. He said this would help the government slowly embark on more relaxation by saving people from the virus. He also directed the officials to adopt best practices at the quarantine centres.

State-level quarantine committee chairperson and ACS PWD Veenu Gupta informed that in most of the quarantine centres in Nagaur home-made food is made available to inmates. In Baran district, about 2,000 migrants have been shifted to home quarantine from institutional quarantine. She said the administration is seeking the help of organisations and individuals to engage people in quarantine to constructive and creative activities.

ACS industry Subodh Agarwal said the state government had given its consent to all the states on the return of Rajasthani migrants from other states by train. He said there is no pending NOC on part of the state government. He said there is sufficient number of trains now available. The West Bengal government had also agreed for transportation of migrants from the state and towards the state.
