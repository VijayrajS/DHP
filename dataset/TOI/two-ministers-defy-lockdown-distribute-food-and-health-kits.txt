BALLARI: Two senior ministers in Karnataka are in the eye of a storm after they allegedly violated lockdown measures imposed by their own government and distributed free food, groceries, vegetables and protective kits to poor people, here on Saturday.

Health minister B Sriramulu, who is part of the task force to fight Covid-19 in Karnataka, and forest minister Anand Singh, who is also the district incharge minister for Ballari, have since then faced flak from various quarters including from their own party leaders for allegedly letting hundreds of people throng to collect free food packets from them in Ballari and Hospet, which together has recorded 13 positive cases so far.

Many who rushed to grab food packets did not bother to protect themselves with even a mask. Visuals showed people coming in hordes and jostling to collect the packets.

The videos, which have gone viral, also showed Sriramulu standing with his team by the roadside at Rupangudi Road in Ballari and spreading out tables to distribute food kits to people. Those in the queue included elderly, women and children.

“Whoever has done it, he has committed a blunder whether it is Sriramulu in Ballari or Anand Singh in Hospet. All these elected representatives want to show that they are serving people in their constituency. It is nothing but a political stunt,” said a senior BJP leader, slamming the duo.

However, Sriramulu and Singh blamed the people, who came in large numbers to collect the food packets. “We had asked them to come wearing masks and also advised them to maintain distance. But they did not heed to our plea,” they claimed.

Nearly one lakh food and health kits were given to people.
