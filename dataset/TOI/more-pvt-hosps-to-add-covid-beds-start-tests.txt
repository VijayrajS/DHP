Increase Covid beds, tests: WB government to private hospitals
2020-05-08
KOLKATA: Private hospitals in Kolkata were asked by the health department on Thursday to enhance the number of Covid beds and increase the capacity of their existing units. In a meeting held at Swasthya Bhavan, they have also been asked to start testing Covid samples to resume normal services and operate at full strength. 

The meeting was chaired by health secretary Vivek Kumar in the presence of health services director Ajay Chakraborty and was attended by at least 16 private hospital representatives. Health officials also stressed on the need to resume normal operations, which, they pointed out, will happen only if they scaled up their testing facilities. It was also hinted that hospitals could soon be allowed to conduct tests on outpatients.

Prodded by the health department, at least two hospitals have decided to extend their Covid units and three have declared that they will introduce RT-PCR testing facilities at their labs. Among those who have decided to extend their Covid units are RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and Medica Superspecialty Hospital. While the former will add 15 more beds to its five-bed Covid unit, Medica will scale up to 47 beds from 28. AMRI increased its Covid unit capacity to 51 from 39 last week.

“At RTIICS, we are scaling up our services to normal levels and are in the process of setting up our own RT-PCR lab,” said zonal director R Venkatesh. Medica, too, will introduce a testing facility.

The emphasis at the meeting was on resumption of normal services at private hospitals, according to a private hospital representative who attended the meeting. “We were also asked to scale up testing facilities for Covid. Our inputs were also taken regarding challenges faced by us and we were assured that they will be addressed. Overall, it was a productive meeting,” he said.

Woodlands Hospital, too, is ready to start Covid tests and is prepared with its laboratory. “We have applied for NABL and are waiting for kits so that we can start RT-PCR Covid-19 testing,” said CEO Rupali Basu.

The health officials also reiterated the need to resume both elective and emergency surgeries and asked private hospital representatives to ensure that each dialysis patient is tested for Covid. They were also advised to resume emergency procedures like transplantations. “Every hospital should ensure that their diagnostic services were run normally. No patient should be refused and we should be humane in our approach,” said a hospital representative. At least two private hospitals, however, pointed out that they wouldn’t be able to start Covid units due to their location and space constraints. While one has just begun constructing a new wing, the other pointed out that they were surrounded by schools and had no extra space for a Covid unit.

Fortis Hospital is gearing up to extend its 20-bed Covid unit to around 30 beds. “We are in the process of expanding the unit which should be completed in about a week. Also, we have drawn up a blueprint for testing outpatients which will be a big step ahead. It will free up a lot of beds that are now being occupied by suspects who can’t be tested without admission,” said Fortis pulmonologist Raja Dhar.
