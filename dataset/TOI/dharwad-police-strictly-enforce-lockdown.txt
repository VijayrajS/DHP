Dharwad: Following the central government declaring Dharwad district a Covid-19 hotspot, the police stepped up measures to implement the lockdown stringently on Thursday.

The central government, on Wednesday night, included Dharwad district in the list of Covid-19 hotspots, and asked the state government to strictly enforce the lockdown.

The decision to declare Dharwad district a hotspot came after six people in the district tested positive for Covid-19. A 33-year-old man, who was identified as P-21, from Hosayallapur in Dharwad, who tested positive for Covid-19, and was quarantined, has since recovered, and was discharged. However, another person in Mullan Oni in Hubballi, and four of his primary contacts, who tested positive, subsequently, have been quarantined.

Senior police officers and the deputy commissioner had a video conference, on Wednesday evening, with home minister Basavaraj Bommai, and it was decided during the course of the conference, that the implementation of the lockdown in the district should be stringent.

Accordingly, the police swung into action and chased away people who were loitering about the streets, and those who were moving around on their two-wheelers. On Thursday morning, police seized several two-wheelers, and made some people who had ventured out, do sit-ups.

The police stopped those moving around in cars and checked their documents, and warned the occupants not to travel unnecessarily.

The entry of vehicles was barred on the main roads and interior roads, and those violating the lockdown were caned.

The police, headed by commissioner R Dileep, are warning the people through the public address system, to stay indoors. “However, some youths were found wandering around unnecessarily, and we had to to send them back home,”said a police officer.

“The instructions are clear: Stay home until further orders, or come out and face police action,” he added.
