NEW DELHI: With many health professionals in the national capital testing positive for novel coronavirus, Delhi government on Friday asked the medical directors of its hospitals to seek written explanation from such health workers how they got infected.

In an order, which was later put in abeyance following public outrage, the state health secretary said the health workers should explain how they got infected despite wearing the required protective gear, maintaining safe distance and following precautions prescribed for healthcare workers.

The May 1 order said it is reported that many doctors, nurses, paramedics and other staff in non-Covid hospitals are either getting infected or reported as a contact of infected persons.

“Medical directors are indiscriminately sending them in quarantine either in hotels or their homes for 14 days. This practice is causing an unnecessary shortage of doctors and staff in hospitals,” it stated.

The order directed the medical director of hospitals to constitute a team of doctors to ascertain whether a person declared a contact comes under the central government’s parameters to be declared as the contact of a positive patient.

However, later in the evening, another order was issued by the health secretary stating that the previous order regarding shortage of staff in non-Covid-19 hospitals due to infections of doctors and staff was being kept in abeyance till further orders.

More than 200 health professionals from non-Covid facilities across the national capital have tested positive for novel coronavirus.
