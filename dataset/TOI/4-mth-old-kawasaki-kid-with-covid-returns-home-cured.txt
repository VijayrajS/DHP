Kolkata: Thirteen days after a four-month-old child from Tarakeshwar, who had been suffering from the rare Kawasaki disease, had tested positive for Covid-19 along with his mother, the two returned home from the Medical College Hospital on Sunday night amid cheers from the medical staffers.

Doctors at the hospital said they had conducted retests on the woman and her child who had a major complication, though the revised Covid treatment protocol does not make it a necessity. “Both of them tested negative and we are happy that they could return home. We have advised home quarantine for the woman and her child,” said a doctor, who had treated the two. A family friend of the woman told TOI that she had returned to the house of the child’s maternal uncle in Dum Dum. 

“The woman’s husband and other family members are still in quarantine in Tarakeshwar,” she said. The child’s mother said she was impressed with the facility at the hospital.
