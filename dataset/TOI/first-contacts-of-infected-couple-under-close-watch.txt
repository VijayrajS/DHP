The first contacts of the infected Pune couple are being monitored closely, Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said on Wednesday. 

At a press meet attended by Mhaisekar, district collector Naval Kishore Ram, commissioner of police K Venkateshan and among others, the authorities urged citizens to stay calm and not fall for rumours.
