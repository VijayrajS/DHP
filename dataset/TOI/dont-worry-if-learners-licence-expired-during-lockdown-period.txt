Mohali: Don’t worry if learner’s licence expired during lockdown period

MOHALI: The applicants due for appearance for driving test for the issuance of permanent driving licence after their learner’s licence expired during the lockdown period need not panic. 


The applicants were feeling anxious as the online appointment portal of the Punjab government had been refusing to accept their applications. Many have been approaching the Mohali regional transport officer (RTO) with complaints of the web portal, which only replies, “Your licence is expired,” and does not give a date for appearance for driving test.

However, Mohali RTO Sukhvinder Kumar said, “We are working on it and all such applicants will be accommodated soon. Only 50% of the applicants are being given appointments to avoid any rush at the test counters. The state government has ordered to maintain social distancing and those not getting appointments must not panic.” 

Sources in the transport office said instructions have been issued to the state traffic police not to challan those with learner’s driving licence that expired during the lockdown period. They have been told to treat it as a valid licence, but challan for any violation committed, said an officer.

The automated driving test centre came up in Mohali in April 2016 at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore. It is spread over 3.5 acres at Papri village in Sector 82. The facility hosts driving tests for two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers. 

A driving licence is issued immediately after passing the test at the tracks equipped with signage and lights. A doctor is also available for conducting a medical fitness test of the applicant. 

The centre is equipped with CCTV cameras and the process of issuance of licence is computerised.
