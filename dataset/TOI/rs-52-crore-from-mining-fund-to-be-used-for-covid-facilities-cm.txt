Rs 52 crore from mining fund to be used for Covid facilities: CM Pramod Sawant
2020-03-31
PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday that the decision to transfer food security allowance under the midday meal scheme to the child’s parents has been kept on hold. 


The Union government allowed the state to utilise Rs 52 crore from the district mineral fund — collected from mining companies to be spent on the welfare of mining dependent people — to set up facilities in view of Covid-19, the CM said.

Sawant also said that the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has not been withdrawn from the streets of Goa, and that they would continue to bring “discipline”. Speaking to reporters, Sawant said that he has spoken to the director of education and issued a direction to keep on hold the transfer of food security allowance. Sawant said that the amount to be transferred to the parent’s account is Rs 200, and the government has to spend Rs 400 to transfer it.

Last week, with schools closed due to the lockdown and students unable to receive their midday meals, the state government had decided to transfer the food security allowance into their parents’ bank accounts.

Schools have been closed in the state with effect from March 16, and students have been unable to receive their midday meals. In a letter dated March 20, the ministry of human resource development advised states to provide either midday meal or food security allowance if the midday meal itself can’t be provided for any reason.

Sawant also urged flour mills to operate so that people can consume whole wheat flour. He also said the government is taking all steps to maintain the food chain in the state. He said that 268 tonne of vegetables was brought to Goa by the horticulture corporation, and supplied to 1,200 outlets across the state.
