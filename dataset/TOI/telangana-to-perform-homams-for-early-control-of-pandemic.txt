2020-03-22
HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has sought cooperation of devotees to check spread of coronavirus and appealed to them to stay away from congregations for the ensuing Ugadi and Sitarama Kalyanotsavam at Bhadrachalam. Also, the endowments department will conduct Sudarshana and Mrityunjaya homams at major temples, praying for early control of the coronavirus pandemic. 


To prevent spread of coronavirus, the state government has decided that Ugadi and Sri Rama Navami festivities would be held by the government, but devotees would not be allowed. Endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy said the devotees could watch the celestial wedding 'Sitarama Kalyanotsavam' live on their television sets. Also, the Ugadi Panchanga Sravanam would be held at the endowments office on March 25, which would be telecast live. 

"Like every year, Sitarama kalyanotsavam will be performed at Sitaramachandra Swamy Temple at Bhadrachalam. It would be telecast live. The celestial wedding will be held inside the temple premises," Indrakaran Reddy said and added the state government would offer 'pattu vasthralu' (sil robes) and 'talambralu' (pearls, rice with turmeric paster) to the presiding deity as per tradition.
