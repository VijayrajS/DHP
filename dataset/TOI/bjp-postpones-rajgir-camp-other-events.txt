2020-03-15
PATNA: The BJP has postponed all its state and district level programmes in view of coronavirus threat. The booth and block level events of the party, however, will continue.


BJP’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said in a bid to avoid mass gatherings, the party has postponed its three-day training camp at Rajgir in Nalanda district which was to be held from March 20. The event was to be attended by party’s national president J P Nadda.

The party has also postponed various workshops it had planned to organise at district level. “The party workers should avoid being in a crowd of more than 50 people,” Jaiswal said.

Meanwhile, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Saturday welcomed the social distancing measures initiated by the state government to prevent spread of Covid-19. He, however, said screening centres should be set up at entry and exit points of airports and railway stations.
