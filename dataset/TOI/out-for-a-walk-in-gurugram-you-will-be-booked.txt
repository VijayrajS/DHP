Lockdown: Out for a walk in Gurugram? You will be booked
2020-04-10
GURUGRAM: To enforce social distancing and prohibit residents from coming out, police on Thursday said FIRs will be filed against morning walkers and park-goers for violating lockdown guidelines in the city. Two residents can't go out together even if they are going to purchase essential items, officers said. 


The move comes after many resident welfare associations (RWAs) and residents of DLF areas raised the issue with Gurugram police and district administration officials during a meeting on Thursday. They said many residents continue to go out for morning walks and needlessly loiter around in parks and streets.

R S Rathee, the MCG councillor of Ward No. 34 - under which most DLF areas fall - said police have warned that anyone found unnecessarily moving on roads outside their houses will be booked. 

No crowds will be allowed at markets and outlets selling essentials. DLF-1 SHO Vishnu Prasad directed security guards to not allow any non-essential movement in licenced colonies.

DCP (east) Chander Mohan told TOI that all parks are closed. "Strict action, including registration of FIRs, will be be taken against those found violating the guidelines or moving around on parks and streets, " he said. 

Asked about the order, Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, "Lockdown rules certainly need to be adhered to. Violations won't be condoned."

Most residents welcomed the move. 

Other residents, meanwhile, sought clarity on whether residents can move within the premises of their residential society. "There is no clarity on restriction on movement of residents within societies and complexes. There should be clear guidelines to avoid confusion," said Rajesh Ranjan, a resident of Sushant Lok.
