Coronavirus: Parliamentary panel of transport, tourism hold meet
2020-03-19
NEW DELHI: A special parliamentary standing committee meeting of “transport, tourism and culture” was called on Wednesday, to assess the impact of Corona virus.


The hotel sector has already reported 80-90% cancellations and the railways has reported cancellations of 63%.

While the panel slammed the railway ministry for its “unpreparedness” to tackle Covid-19, it praised Air India for its evacuation of Indians from abroad in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The crucial meeting of the parliamentary panel was held two weeks after Trinamool Congress member Derek O’ Brien wrote to the chairman of the panel demanding an emergency meeting on the issue.

The meeting which was attended by 20 MPs slammed the chairman, railway board V K Yadav for being “unprepared” and said he made a “shoddy presentation,” some members who attended the meeting said. “While the aviation and tourism officials came with presentations with slides, chairman, railway board did not. He just read out from some papers he was carrying. 

Yadav informed the Committee that about 63% of tickets had been cancelled this month due to coronavirus.

The tourism ministry official who attended the meeting said the tourism industry was hit hard by the spread of the disease and that business worth Rs 5 lakh crore was affected. He said the impact was significant on 95% of small and medium scale industries which have cash reserve only for 20-25 days after which they have to be shut down.
