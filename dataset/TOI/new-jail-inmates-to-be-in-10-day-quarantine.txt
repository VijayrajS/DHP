New jail inmates to be in 10-day quarantine
2020-03-19
Lucknow: A day after convicts in Kanpur jail protested, saying outsiders should not be allowed to enter the prison cells in the wake of coronavirus outbreak, DG prisons decided to keep new inmates isolated for 10 days before admitting them inside.

A team of doctors has also been asked to check each prisoner. 

DG prisons Anand Kumar said that a special task force has been created in all 71 operational jails and a daily report is being monitored at the headquarters.

Isolation centres and quarantine cells have been made functional to prevent the spread of the pandemic. Every new inmate with symptoms will be quarantined for 10 days. Older inmates of jails with any symptoms of Covid-19 will be sent to isolation cells in the jail hospital. Further tests and reference to CMOs for confirmatory tests will follow on the advice of the jail doctor. 

“We have quarantine barracks where new entrants would be kept after proper medical inspection. We may shift inmates from jails with full capacity,” said Kumar.

Jail superintendents have been asked to purchase thermal scanners and start using them for those entering the prisons. “The jail manual has a detailed provision on dealing with prisoners during outbreak of an epidemic, such as restraining the number of visitors. However, it will still be the discretion of the superintendent,” added the DG.
