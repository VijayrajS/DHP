Lockdown blues again after 42 wards sealed
2020-06-11
Vijayawada: A week after stringent restrictions were eased, the city once again went into a lockdown with 42 wards declared containment zones on Tuesday night. Major commercial neighbourhoods including One Town and Governorpet were deserted on Wednesday with officials ensuring containment orders were implemented. Authorities of the roads and buildings department erected barricades on arterial roads after boundaries of the new zones were demarcated.

Normalcy had been returning to the city after the state government lifted most restrictions as part of ‘Unlock 1.0’ a week ago. Following the new guidelines issued by the Krishna district collector, about two-thirds of the city now falls under a containment zone. 

Meanwhile, officials with the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) along with city police carried out surprise inspections at One Town and urged shopkeepers to not open their establishments until further orders. Daily wage earners and employees at wholesale markets in the area, however, worried about the loss of livelihood that the reimposition of the lockdown would bring, “Shops reopened a week ago and we have strictly followed physical distancing. Shops closed all of a sudden with containment orders issued by the collector and we again lost our livelihood. State government should help daily labourers if it continues the lockdown,” said K Narayana Gupta, who works at a wholesale stationery shop in Pulipativari Street in One Town.

Commercial establishments at Gandhi Nagar and Satyanarayana Puram remained open despite being declared containment zones.

Construction activities, which had resumed, were stalled in containment zones. Public transport took a hit as well, with cabs withdrawing their services and autorickshaws disappearing off the roads.
