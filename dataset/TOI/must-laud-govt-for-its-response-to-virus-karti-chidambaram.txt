Must laud govt for its response to virus: Karti Chidambaram
2020-03-18
NEW DELHI: Congress MP Karti Chidambaram complimented the Union government for its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, and said one should not “play politics” over the issue.

His comments in Lok Sabha during zero hour came against the backdrop of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi repeatedly attacking the government over its handling of the outbreak and accusing it of not taking adequate measures.

Chidambaram, the son of former finance minister P Chidambaram, said the government should be complimented for its efforts. He then spoke about complaints that people in quarantined had been kept in “substandard” facilities under “unhygienic” conditions. Many of these people, most of whom were quarantined following their return from abroad, had the wherewithal for self-isolation and should be allowed to do so, he said.

On Saturday, Congress veteran Anand Sharma had expressed satisfaction with steps taken by the government to combat coronavirus. He told TOI, “I am fully satisfied with the steps taken by the government and with our preparedness to check coronavirus.” He added that the country was following the WHO protocol, which was the requirement for dealing with the crisis.
