2020-05-20
Nagpur: Unlike some containment zones, Nagpur Municipal Corporation's ante-natal checkup (ANC) camp for pregnant women organized at urban primary health centre in Babulkheda in Rameshwari got good response on Tuesday.

Over 100 women visited the camp while 46 swab samples were collected for Covid testing, zonal medical officials said. On Wednesday, the camp is likely to be held at Manewada.

The camp was mainly intended to benefit women from Parvati Nagar area, others from as far as Manish Nagar too came, officials said. This led to huge rush at Manavata High School where the camp was put up. 

The pregnant women were mobilized with the help of door to door survey carried out by Asha workers, officials said. Earlier, ANCs were held at Mahdibagh, Pachpaoli, Mominpura, KT Nagar, Sudam Nagari in Pandhrabodi.

The city has recorded eight pregnant women who tested positive for coronavirus. Five pregnant women alone were found positive from ANC at Mominpura on May 14. Two of them were into their ninth month and delivered healthy babies at IGGMCH and GMCH. Later, two more women delivered babies at these hospitals. Total four pregnant women tested during ANCs have tested positive and given birth to negative babies. 

Officials said pregnant women nearing their term must compulsorily get themselves checked up at ANC and give their samples. “As there is risk to doctors and medical staff from them, these women must ensure they got themselves tested for Covid. The result will help in ensuring the hospital staff doesn’t get infected in case they are carriers,” they said.

Earlier, the rush had panicked residents of Babulkheda where the camp was held. People complained the crowding of women raised concern of spread of coronavirus.

A doctor at the camp said, “Initially there was rush for swab testing but we controlled the crowd and made them stand with physical distancing. People were getting impatient because of the rush and the rising temperature.”
