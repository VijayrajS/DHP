Secunderabad: With three Covid-19 positive cases, Lalbazar has turned into the latest Covid-19 hotspot in Secunderabad Cantonment. The cantonment also recorded its first coronavirus related death when a 70-year-old died in Bolarum on Sunday night. 

With Lalbazar, the number of hotspots in cantonments have risen to six. Patients from Secunderabad areas such as Bolarum, Picket, Bowenpally, Mahendra Hills and Kharkhana are undergoing treatment. Some recovered and subsequently discharged.

As several army residential quarters and defence assets are adjacent to Lalbazar, officials are concerned about the situation. 

The district medical and health staff conducted door-to-door survey at Lalbazar, which is one of the largest commercial area in the cantonment. 

“We have advised the residents to wear masks, maintain social distance and follow preventive measures,” said in-charge medical officer, Dr Punna Sushma. 

The deceased, a 70-year-old cancer patient was undergoing treatment at MNJ Institute of Oncology & Regional Cancer Centre, Red Hills, for the past one month. Tests revealed that he had contracted coronavirus as well. 

“Daughter of the deceased is a resident of Om Sai Colony at Bolarum and used to visit the patient regularly. After we came to know that her father was infected, she was tested and quarantined. A door-to-door survey was also conducted at Om Sai Colony but no Covid-19 cases were identified,” said a medical officer. 

The three infected persons in Lalbazar are from Airlines Colony, Srinagar Colony and Lalamiya Basthi. According to officials a new Covid-19 case has also been identified at Picket.
