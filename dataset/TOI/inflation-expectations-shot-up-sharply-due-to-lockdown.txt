AHMEDABAD: Findings of the Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) by professor Abhiman Das of IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) mentioned that the inflation expectations have rose sharply over February 2020 projections. Compared to 3.85% reported in February, for March the figure was 4.57%. “It is the highest ever print recorded since the inception of this survey in May 2017,” mentioned the report while talking about the one year ahead projections made by MSMEs that were part of the exercise.

“The effect of the lockdown extension against the backdrop of Covid-19 spread is seen in the results of this round. The economy has come to a standstill, and inflation expectations are rising fast,” mentioned the report. The cost perceptions data shows signs of cost pressure, mentioned the survey. “Around two-fifth of the firms perceive that the cost increase is over 6% and over one-fourth of the firms perceive it would increase 10%.”

Due to lockdown, 93% of firms in the sample said that sales were much less than normal – the figure which was already under distress at 85% in February. Over 93% of the firms expect much less than normal or somewhat less than normal profit margins for the month to come.
