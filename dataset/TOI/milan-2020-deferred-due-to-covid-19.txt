Visakhapatnam: The Indian navy has postponed the multilateral naval exercise, Milan 2020, to be held off the Visakhapatnam coast from March 18 in view of the Coronavirus outbreak.

The decision to postpone the 10-day event comes a day after authorities confirmed a Covid 19 positive case in Hyderabad and identified and quarantined 17 others from AP, who travelled with the infected techie from Bengaluru to Hyderabad in a bus. The navy took stock of the situation and in consideration of the safety of participants and travel restrictions, the congregation of navies from 30 countries was postponed, an official said.

Apart from the US, the UK and Australia, navies from Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, Philipines and Sri Lanka among others were supposed to join the event attended by 4,000 personnel.

While the biennial event is conducted under the aegis of the Andaman and Nicobar Command since 1995, Milan 2020 was slated to be held in the Indian mainland at Visakhapatnam for the first time, and all foreign countries had confirmed their participation. “In deference to this interest, the Indian Navy, thanks the numerous navies for having accepted their invitation to participate in Milan 2020 and looks forward toward scheduling Milan at a later convenient date,” the navy said in a statement.

Milan provides an opportunity for participating navies to come together to nurture stronger ties, besides fostering cooperation through naval exercises and professional interactions.
