MEERUT: Scores of policemen posted at Meerut’s two police stations were on the edge on Tuesday after it was found that one of the five men, arrested for allegedly attacking government officials, had tested positive for Covid-19. Soon, a hunt for all the close contacts was launched and five policemen were put under quarantine. 

The detainee was kept in the lockups of two police stations-- Sadar and Delhi Gate. Both the buildings were sanitised.

On Sunday, three Covid-19 patients and nine others were booked for allegedly attacking a team of policemen and district administration officials in city’s Delhi Gate area when they went to take away the infected men and to seal the lane they were living in.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Meerut Ajay Sahni told TOI, “We had arrested eight persons, including three Covid-19 positive patients. The positive ones were isolated. While five were put in the lockups. Now, out of those five, one has tested positive. He had been put into lockups of two police stations. Both have been sanitized and five policemen including two sub-inspectors and two constables have been sent to isolation centres for 14 days.”

During a drive, police had found 10 Jamaat members, all residents of Malegaon in Maharashtra, staying in the mosque in Jali Koti area. Of them, three had tested positive on Friday evening.

A police team accompanied by city magistrate rushed to the spot to sanitize and seal the lane in Jali Kothi area, where the mosque is situated. They also wanted to take away the positive patients.

However, a scuffle broke out. Later, police claimed that stones were also hurled on them. “City magistrate Sushant Jain and two policemen sustained injuries in the attack by locals who were against the sealing,” a police officer said.

Soon after the attack, 12 people were booked and eight of them arrested for the attack.
