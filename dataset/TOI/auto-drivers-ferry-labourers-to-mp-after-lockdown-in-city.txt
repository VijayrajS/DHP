Auto drivers ferry labourers to MP after lockdown in city
2020-03-22
Nagpur: Even as most auto drivers in the city are worried about incurring losses due to the lockdown, Asad (name changed) is going the extra mile to double his daily income. On Saturday, he was among the few autorickshaw drivers who earned a Rs3600 through a 130km single trip to Seoni in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh which has sealed its border for public and private buses from Maharashtra due to coronavirus outbreak. 

Even Chhattisgarh has closed its border for public and private buses from Maharashtra, creating problems for labourers who come from these states to find work in Nagpur. Some of the auto drivers who were stationed near Madhya Pradesh Parivahan Bus Stand saw an opportunity in this. 

Some of the auto drivers at the stand told TOI that since morning five-six auto drivers have boarded passengers, mostly labourers who want to go to their hometowns in Seoni and Chhindwara following the lockdown. 

“We are charging Rs600 per person for a trip to Seoni and Chhindwara. In a single trip, we take around six persons. There are no passengers during the return trip,” an auto driver said. 

A one-way trip to Seoni or Chhindwara by bus costs around Rs200 to Rs250. But now passengers have no option but to agree with the fare charged by the auto drivers. 

According to deputy RTO Atul Adey, auto drivers are not allowed to leave the district limit. “If any autorickshaw is found overloaded and out of the district limits, action will be taken. The transport commissioner has also issued an order prohibiting shared auto rickshaws from plying due to coronavirus outbreak,” he said.
