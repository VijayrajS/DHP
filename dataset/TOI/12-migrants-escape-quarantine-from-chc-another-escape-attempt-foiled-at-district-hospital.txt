Pilibhit: As many as 12 migrants from Uttarakhand and other districts of UP, who had reached the community health center (CHC) at Barkhera for medical screening on Wednesday morning, fled from the hospital campus in the absence of any police surveillance. The migrants, from Palia Mafi village under Barkhera police station, had returned home from their places of work elsewhere. But when villagers of Palia Mafi did not allow them to enter without undergoing medical screening, they went to the CHC.

A number of other people quarantined in the old district hospital campus in Pilibhit city also attempted to escape by climbing down from an attic window using a rope made of bedsheets, but their attempt was foiled by health staff.

According to Dr S K Singh, the medical officer in-charge at Barkhera CHC, the migrants had been asked to wait till an ambulance arrived from the district headquarters to take them to their quarantine facility. “But when the ambulance got delayed, the migrants decided to sneak out. We have conveyed this information to Barkhera police station, requesting them to trace the migrants, said Dr Singh. He added that this could happen because of lack of police surveillance at the CHC.

Regarding the escape attempt by quarantined people in Pilibhit, additional chief medical officer Dr C M Chaturvedi said as many as 50 people, who are quarantined at the old district hospital campus, had attempted to flee on Tuesday night, but were thwarted by vigilant health staff.

“We have now locked the quarantine centre from outside, and the police have deployed two constables each for 12-hourly shifts there, to prevent any untoward situations. Prior to this, police used to take a brief round of the campus,” Chaturvedi said.
