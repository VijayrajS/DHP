Meerut: Kartikeya Rana, son of former Uttar Pradesh minister Rajendra Rana of Samajwadi Party, was booked under relevant sections, after he allegedly misbehaved with staff of the police station in their locality. According to sources, Kartikeya and his friends were in a park outside his home, when a police patrol caught them and asked them to get inside. 

This irked Rana and his group, who got into a verbal altercation with a constable. As the altercation intensified, reinforcements from the local police station were called in and the matter was settled for the time being after senior officials intervened. 

Later, an FIR against Kartikeya was registered at Sadar Bazar police station, based on the complaint of a constable. “He started misbehaving and attacked cops, who were trying to enforce lockdown. He has been arrested,” said Saharanpur SSP Dinesh Kumar P. 

Kartikeya, though, had a completely different version of the event. “A man was on his way to fetch milk, when patrolling cops on a motorcycle began assaulting him. I was standing at my balcony and decided to intervene. The cops began misbehaving with me. Finally, they accepted their mistake, apologised and left,” Kartikeya said.
