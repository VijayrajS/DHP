Nagpur: Two groups of State Reserve Police Force — Gr-13 and Gr-5 or IRB-2 — were again deployed in Covid-19 hotspots of city. It comes as the citizens in containment areas were not co-operating and were not following social distancing and other norms.

City police chief BK Upadhyay claimed SRPF deployment was to keep check on citizens. “The SRPF was deployed around 20 days back but had been withdrawn. Now we have called it back. It is a reinforcement for us, as we were facing manpower crunch. Most of their deployment is in containment areas to ensure norms are followed and disease does not spread to other areas,” he said.

He also said SRPF deployment was not limited to Nagpur. “It is taking place across the state including in cities like Pune and Mumbai. SRPF will give local police a bit of relaxation,” he added.

The Gr-13 has been deployed in Zone 3 of police department. This includes areas under Tehsil, Lakadganj, Shanti Nagar and Ganeshpeth police stations. The bulk of deployment is under Tehsil police, which has areas like Mominpura.

While Tehsil received six sections, Lakadganj, Shanti Nagar and Ganeshpeth stations received two sections each. The Gr-15 or IRB-2, has been deployed in Zone 4, Zone 2, Zone 5 and its two sections have been kept as reserves.

While Zone 4 received one section, Zone 2 and Zone 5 received one platoon each.

TOI had earlier reported several instances in which citizens from containment area were roaming or hiding in other areas exposing others to the outbreak. Earlier, 10 people from Satranjipura, a Covid-19 hotspot, were found hiding in a godown at Kalamna. While two children of a couple which was relative of Satranjipura deceased, were also hiding in Bhaldarpura area.

Zone 1 with areas like Hingna, Sonegaon, MIDC, Bajaj Nagar, Wadi and Pratap Nagar will not have any SRPF deployment.
