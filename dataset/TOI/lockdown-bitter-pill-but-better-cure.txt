Lockdown: Bitter pill but better cure

K Sri Sai, an electric engineer from Prakasam district, AP, who is currently in Hyderabad narrates his experience during lockdown


It is a strange experience for some of us students and jobholders from India, who were in Wuhan when the lockdown was first announced there. We have been experiencing lockdowns and a strict quarantine for 15 days in Gurugram (in February) when we returned from China. In a way, we have lived in isolation in the past two months and it is likely to continue for another 21 days. This is the time to maintain restraint and keep clam. 

If China has controlled the virus, it is because of the public and government cooperation. People were not disturbed even though they were given the option of coming out of the house once in a week and one person in a family was allowed. The apartment main doors would be closed. We were confined to our rooms with no outside connection. Doctors used to monitor temperature twice in a week. 

The isolation, in fact, brought many of us together. We were working from our rooms but built close bonding with many people. My roommate got into a depression, worried over the developments. All of us got together and consoled him. Now, we have become good friends. 

The isolation definitely is a bitter pill but offers better cure. After attending to our office duty, we would chalk out a plan. We dowloaded many e-books and tried to gain knowledge on coronavirus.
