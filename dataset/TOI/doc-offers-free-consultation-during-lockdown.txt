MADURAI: A doctor at Karaikudi in Sivaganga district has been providing free service to people in his town since the beginning of the lockdown.


Dr A R Boopathy Raja, general physician, said that he has been practicing in his home town for the past five years. Having completed his MBBS in Chennai, he had worked at a private hospital there for a few years before serving people in Karaikudi. People from the neighbouring villages also come to him for various ailments as he is charging only Rs 50 as his consultation fee.

“I too closed my clinic when the lockdown started. But people started calling me as they want to open the clinic and I started consultation on April 1,” he said. He had always waived his consultation fee for very old patients and also gave them medicines free of cost.

Now, he has decided to offer his service for fee for all patients. But, patients have to pay for the medicines.

The staff at the clinic ensure that all the patients maintain social distancing and they clean their hands with sanitizer on entry. Masks are a must while coming for consultation. “If patients come with complaints of fever or cough they are referred to the government hospital,” he said.

Many of his patients are octogenarians such as Palaniappan M of Karaikudi, who had become anxious as he was not able to get his BP checked regularly.
