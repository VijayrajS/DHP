2020-05-04
MADURAI: In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the training period of the newly-recruited police personnel have been reduced to 15 days from the usual six months. They will undergo training at three centres in Madurai after which they will be deployed for Covid-19 duty.


As many as 528 special battalion police, armed reserve police and grade two women police personnel from Madurai and other districts will undergo training at three centres in Madurai.

Police sources said that they were recruited earlier this year through written examination and physical fitness test. They were recently called for training, which will start on Tuesday. Meanwhile, they have been asked to appear for a medical screening and test for Covid-19, before the commencement of training.

They have started queueing up at the training centres from early on Sunday morning. They were screened for Covid-19 and their belongings were disinfected. Those who have symptoms of Covid-19 will be asked to stay at home till their tests results are out. On completion of training, they are likely to be deployed for Covid-19 prevention works.
