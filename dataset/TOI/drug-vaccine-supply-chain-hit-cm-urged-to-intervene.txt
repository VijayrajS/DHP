Drug, Vaccine Supply Chain Hit, CM Urged To Intervene
2020-03-31
Hyderabad: The Telangana Chemists and Druggists’ Association (TCDA) has appealed to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to intervene and take measures to ensure that the medicine and vaccine supply in the state is not affected further. Hyderabad is known as the pharma capital of India with several pharmaceutical firms having their hubs here.

Association president Ch Janardhan Rao said they were facing severe transportation problems for outstation despatches. “Regular local couriers, transport operators and their branches operating in all parts of Telangana have been closed due to which supply chain has been hit badly,” he said.

Transporters like Decent Lorry Service, Navata Transport, BMPS Transport, SRMT Transport, VRL Transport, Kranti Roadways, ANL Parcel Service, which ferry medicines and vaccines have ceased their operations ever since the pandemic broke out. Couriers like Professional, DTDC, BlueDart and Safe Express are also not operating.“When we contacted them, the transport operators said that drivers and hamalis are not coming to office due to lockdown and coronavirus fear. Even though passes are provided to the staffers, it is difficult for them to reach offices,” Janardhan said. 

Janardhan said transporters should be assured about safety of their staff and passes have to be issued for easy movement of vehicles. “Cabs should be permitted to pick up and drop the staffers and each vehicle should be allowed to carry four persons,” he said. “The government should also insist on courier companies airlift the goods from other states, if needed,” the association said.

Janardhan said with manufacturing units closed, agents were not getting the stocks and urged the CM to take the necessary steps to open the manufacturing units immediately for uninterrupted supply of medicines and vaccines.
