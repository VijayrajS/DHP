KOLHAPUR: The primary education department of the Kolhapur zilla parishad has resorted to online admission process for over 1,900 schools across the district amid the ongoing lockdown, said district primary education officer Asha Ubale.

She said that a few private schools, too, have started with the online admission process. According to Ubale, more guidelines about the commencement of the academic year are awaited from the higher authorities.

She said that the results of Class I to Class IX will be sent by respective schools on WhatsApp.

Secondary education officer Kiran Lohar said that they too have asked the schools to send confirmation of results to parents via online mode so that the unnecessary visit to schools can be avoided.

He said that they are awaiting any kind of confirmation on the commencement of academic year so far. “Generally, schools in Kolhapur district start from June 15.However, it seems highly unlikely this year. We are, therefore, awaiting instructions from the state government on the same,” he said.

He said that the admission process for high schools can be resumed once there are clear instructions on the beginning of the academic activities. The class XI admission process, too, will be decided once the details regarding the Class X results is made clear.

Ramesh More, a member of Kolhapur city and district citizens’ action committee, said that they are keeping an eye on the online admission process and are also keeping a close eye on various demands of schools, including payment of complete fees.
