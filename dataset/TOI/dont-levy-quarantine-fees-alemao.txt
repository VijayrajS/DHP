2020-04-23
COLVA: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao said that he will not allow seafarers to be charged for quarantine facilities once they are brought back to Goa.

“How can the seamen be charged? If the government wants to seek fees from the shipping companies, then that is a different issue as the companies can pay,” he said.

When asked whether the state government can demand the charges from the companies, Alemao said, “The government can make a request.”

Alemao also praised the Prime Minister, home minister, chief minister and NRI office for their efforts to bring home the seafarers.
