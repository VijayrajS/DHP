2020-06-06
Ahmedabad: With rising numbers of Covid 19 cases, Gujarat police has come up with a standard operating procedure (SOP) on how to deal with cases and police station work. 

A senior Gujarat police official said it deals with not only how to make arrests when the person could be a Covid carrier, but also about who to deal with complainants who come to the police stations.

 The SOP will also educate cops on how to deal with crime scenes in times of Covid 19. It will educate cops on dealing with visitors who come to police stations for passports and other police-related work.

 A senior officer said it will cover arresting an accused, interrogation, recording of statements, producing an accused in court and admitting him to the hospital if he is found to be infected.
