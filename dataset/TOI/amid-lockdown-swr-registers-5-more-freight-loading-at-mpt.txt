Margao: Amidst the Covid-19 lockdown when the industry is witnessing a downturn, the South Western Railway (SWR), which was permitted to carry on freight operations, registered a 5% increase in freight loading at the Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) as compared to last year’s figures. 

The Hubballi Division of SWR altogether loaded 2.77 million tonnes (MT) of freight during May 2020. Data revealed by SWR said that the loading included 0.72 MT (178 rakes) of iron Ore, 0.986 MT (247 rakes) of coal, 0.066 MT (23 rakes) of fertilisers, 0.018 MT of sugar and 0.976 MT of other commodities including steel.

As per the data revealed by SWR, 247 rakes of coal weighing nearly 1 million tonnes were loaded at the Mormugao port which is 5.1% higher than corresponding loading done during the same period last year. Loading from MPT of 247 rakes also makes the quantum higher than the previous highest loading of 243 rakes done in a month at the port during the year 2019-20. 

“Loading of 247 rakes from the port was achieved, ensuring the highest steel unloading at Mormugao port of 82 rakes,” a spokesperson of SWR said. 

“Loading of steel from JSW (Torangallu) to Mormugao Port is also at an all-time high of 90 rakes against the previous high of 68 rakes. Rail coefficient of steel dispatches from JSWT siding is 83% against an average rail coefficient of 63%-64% last year," SWR said in a press statement.

“Railway officers and staff, despite restriction due to Covid-19, have taken all efforts to achieve loading by maintaining social distancing and precautions at loading and unloading points,” the spokesperson added.
