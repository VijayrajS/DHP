Thiruvananthapuram: No fishermen from the state trapped in Iran are known to have been affected by Covid-19, fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma told the assembly on Tuesday.

Replying to a submission by Kovalam MLA M Vincent, the minister said that the government is doing everything possible to bring the fishermen back. She said that the Indian embassy in Iran has been contacted by the Noraka to provide assistance to the fishermen.

She also said that the chief minister has written to external affairs minister S Jayashankar and Norka has contacted the embassies in other countries like China, Japan and Saudi Arabia for aiding the Keralites trapped in those countries. “We are taking all possible steps but we can take such steps only in accordance with the law of those countries,” she said.

Earlier, Vincent said that the videos that have come from the camps in Iran where the fishermen have been trapped shows that the sponsors are threatening them by cutting their food and water supply.

As many as 60 fishermen are trapped in Iran and they are unable to leave their rooms in the fear of being affected by Covid-19. Vincent alleged that no one from the Indian embassy or Norka have contacted them so far.
