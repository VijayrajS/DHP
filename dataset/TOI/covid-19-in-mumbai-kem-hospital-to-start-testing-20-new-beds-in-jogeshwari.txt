MUMBAI: To ease the load on the Kasturba Hospital laboratory—the sole facility testing coronavirus samples in the city—the KEM Hospital laboratory will start testing samples from Wednesday. Officials said the centre will be able to handle up to 150 tests every day.


Besides testing, the BMC has added more beds to isolate travellers. A 20-bed isolation centre was started at Bal Thackeray Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari on Tuesday. Civic officials said the centre will treat and even collect samples of coronavirus patients. The samples collected would be sent to Kasturba for testing. The Kasturba lab, where all suspected patients are being admitted, has been carrying out over 100 tests daily. On Tuesday, it processed 131 samples.

State officials said there are also plans to start treatment/quarantine centres at Cooper in Juhu and Shatabdi Hospital, Kandivli.
