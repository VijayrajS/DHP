2020-03-20
PANAJI: Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the coronavirus threat seriously, Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai said, “Recognising the gravity of the marauding pandemic Covid-19, the PM has sought the support of the citizens to tackle the crisis on a war footing by calling for social distancing and ‘janata curfew’ which he said cannot be ignored by any government in the fight against the virus.”


“I am glad that the PM’s appeal is in tune with my demanded for postponement of zilla panchayat polls on Wednesday,” Sardesai said.

“Those pushing for zilla elections inspite of @PMOIndia announcement and endangering public health will be criminally liable!,” the former deputy chief minister said in a tweet. The former deputy CM further said that the Goa government must not test its political health at the cost of public health.
