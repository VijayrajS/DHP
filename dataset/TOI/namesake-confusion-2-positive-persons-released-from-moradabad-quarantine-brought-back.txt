Namesake confusion: 2 positive persons released from Moradabad quarantine, brought back
2020-04-25
Bareilly: In a scary move that could have potentially led to more people coming in contact with Covid-19 positive cases, the health department in Moradabad on Thursday evening mistakenly discharged two Covid-19 patients from a quarantine centre as their names were similar to two other persons, who tested negative, in the same ward. On Friday, after realising their mistake, a medical team brought the two individuals back to the quarantine centre. 

On Thursday evening, as soon as the test report arrived, doctors discharged the two men after confusion due to similar names. 

Meanwhile, district magistrate RK Singh said that no action was initiated against the doctors as it was a “human error that was timely rectified.” 

With one more fresh case having tested positive, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Moradabad has now reached 96.

The DM said, “Covid warriors are braving the odds tirelessly. Soon after the novel coronavirus patients were discharged by mistake, a team reached their houses and brought them back to the quarantine centre.”

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr MC Garg said, “Two persons at the quarantine centre have similar names as that of two others. Two of them were found positive while the other two were found negative for Covid-19. By mistake, the two positive cases were discharged."

The CMO said, “It was indeed a mistake, and an enquiry headed by the additional director of health has been set up. Appropriate action would be taken after the enquiry report comes.”

The CMO said that on Friday they received a report of 90 cases, out of which only one was found positive.
