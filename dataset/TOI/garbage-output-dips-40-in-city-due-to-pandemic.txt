Garbage output dips 40% in city due to pandemic
2020-04-29
Jaipur: Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has said there has been a 40% decline in trash generation in the city since lockdown.

Before the city was shut, JMC was collecting around 1,450 tons of garbage every day which has now come down to 950 tons. According to the civic authorities, the reason for this decline is the closure of all public places, eateries, parks and tourist attractions. 

Executive engineer (projects) at JMC Banne Singh said, “There has been a sharp decline as people are not coming out of their houses. Roads are empty and there are no street vendors especially in the Walled City area. We are working every day but garbage generation is low.”

When everything was normal, 580 hoopers in the city usually did 2,400 rounds every day. This has now gone down to 1,800 rounds as trash generation is low.

Rajesh Chaudhary, manager of BVG company responsible for garbage collection in the city, said with low garbage, the number of rounds have been reduced. “Earlier one hooper was used for three colonies, but now it is covering four. In hotspot areas like Ramganj, only sanitation workers go inside and dump garbage outside at fixed points from where we pick up,” he said. 

The pandemic has also led to an increase in biomedical waste. PPE kits, masks and gloves consist of major portion of the biomedical waste in the city. There is a plant on Agra Road where such waste is dumped. A firm has been given the contract for the disposal of waste generated from hospitals and quarantines centres in Jaipur. The JMC is paying Rs 2,000 per quarantine centres as it is a highly toxic waste that cannot be disposed of on landfill sites.
