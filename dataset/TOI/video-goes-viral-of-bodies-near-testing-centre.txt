THANE: A video of two bodies of suspected Covid-19 patients kept near a testing centre at civic-run Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital has gone viral. The video shows the bodies just metres away from people waiting to be tested. 

BJP MLA Nitesh Rane tweeted about it and said, “Such instances have happened earlier at hospitals in Mumbai, like Sion and KEM, and now in Thane. This shows basic administrative failure and is a danger to the lives of people.”

Hospital authorities said the bodies were to be taken away. “The bodies were sanitized, covered and kept aside inside the hospital as we were waiting for a hearse, which did not take long,” said dean Dr Pratibha Sawant. TMC chief Vijay Singhal said the issue was resolved but there will be an inquiry.
