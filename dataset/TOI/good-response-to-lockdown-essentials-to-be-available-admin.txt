Good response to lockdown, essentials to be available: Nashik Administration
2020-03-26
NASHIK: Strict implementation of the lockdown was seen in most parts of Nashik on Wednesday and the city wore a deserted look despite the festive occasion of Gudi Padwa.


Most of the roads were clear and only the vehicles transporting essentials were seen moving around on Wednesday. It was in stark contrast of the scenes from Tuesday.

“As against huge rush to the market places on Sunday night and Monday morning, Wednesday was quite peaceful and the streets were deserted. The only ones to move around were those ferrying essential services with valid proofs,” a senior police officer said.

Since Tuesday morning the streets and chowks in the city have been barricaded, disallowing movement of vehicles. Moreover police officials manning a few chowks are discouraging movement of people.

“The borders of the district have been sealed. All junctions have been barricaded. The message to the citizens is very clear. The media reports about people being punished for loitering have also worked to reduce the people on the road. The intention is to keep everyone safe,” the officer said.

Nashikites told TOI that they were relieved after the government assured supply of essentials would not be hampered.

“There was some confusion as to whether we would get our essentials. Now that government has made it clear that there is enough stock and that shops will remain open, we will step out as per requirement,” Keshav Shinde, a Nashik Road resident, said.

District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal also took to Twitter, urging people to remain indoors. “Let’s make things better for people, who are working day and night for the safety of citizens. Stay indoors and stay safe,” Bhujbal said, appealing people to maintain social distance even at home.

District collector Suraj Mandhare allayed public fear about delivery of essential goods ordered by them. “There have been some issues about delivery of goods – food parcels, vegetables, grocery and other essential items. Efforts are being taken for streamlining the same. In a day or two that also will fall in place,” he said.
