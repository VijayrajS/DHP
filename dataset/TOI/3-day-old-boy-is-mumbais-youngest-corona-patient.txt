Coronavirus in Mumbai: 3-day-old boy is city's youngest patient

MUMBAI: A three-day-old boy is Mumbai's youngest Covid-19 patient, and his father alleged that the child and his 26-year-old mother were kept in a room freshly vacated by a coronavirus-positive patient at a Chembur nursing home. The nursing home's receptionist too tested positive for the virus. 

The child's father told TOI that his wife delivered via C-section around 11.30am on March 26. "My wife and son were taken to a private room around 12.30pm, but a nurse came around 2pm and told us to change our room," said the father, who is in quarantine at Kasturba Hospital. 

 The family was moved to another room but not given an explanation. "Just 24 hours later, a doctor telephoned me to say that the room we were moved from had a coronavirus case, and no doctor or nurse would come to our room for checks," said the father, who was charged Rs 65,000 by the nursing home. 

He said if the family had been alerted, they would have insisted on change of clothes or sanitised themselves. While the father insisted that his wife had no symptoms of the virus before coming to the hospital, a civic doctor said, "We don't know if its vertical transmission, it's a medico-legal case. There are chances the baby contaminated the virus from birth."
