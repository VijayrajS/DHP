HARIDWAR: An 18-year-girl, who was a patient of epilepsy but was lately suffering from fever and cough, passed away on Sunday night.


The girl had no travel history. However, as a precautionary measure, eight members of her family were quarantined at home and their samples sent to the lab for Covid-19 testing. Also, a notice is being issued to a private hospital where the deceased girl was allegedly refused to be admitted due to her flu-like symptoms. Haridwar CMO Dr Saroj Naithani told TOI on Monday, “The girl was a patient of epilepsy and suffered from mental disorder. She had complained of fever and cough a week ago. She was taken to a district hospital. Later, she was taken to a private hospital in Kankhal where the hospital authorities reportedly refused to admit her. This is a serious matter and a probe will be conducted. A notice will be issued to the hospital. Those present at her cremation will also be quarantined.”
