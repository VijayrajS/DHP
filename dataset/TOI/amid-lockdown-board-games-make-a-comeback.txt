HYDERABAD: In a heartening trend, amid the 21-day lockdown, many families in the city are seen bonding over board games these days — from scrabble and Ludo to chess, monopoly and carrom. There’s also housie and puzzles that have become a regular affair in many households. 


“Since everybody is at home nowadays, we have a lot of time to spend with our parents. So, we decided to play ludo. It’s a lot of fun,” said Nikhil Reddy, 25, an architect in Somajiguda. At a distance in Sainikpuri, it’s carrom that seems to be the favourite. Many have even been reaching out to neighbours to borrow the game. “Because all sports shops are closed, I borrowed a carrom board from my neighbours to play with my grandchildren. It gives us an opportunity to bond over and keeps the children engaged,” said Kavali Annapurna, a resident of Sainikpuri. Another game that’s become a common evening feature in many homes is housie. Rajshri Srivastava, a resident of Banjara Hills, Road Number 10, says she looks forward to it every day as it brings the entire family together. “It has become a great source of entertainment for our kids and their grandparents. We thoroughly enjoy playing it,” she said.

The jigsaw puzzle is another hit. “We have made it a point to finish a 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzle in a duration of two days. It is fun. Everybody gets to participate and we have a good time with snacks and drinks,” Meghana Joshi, an IT consultant based in Jubilee Hills said.

Apart from getting together with families, many are also using the online version of these games to bond with friends. “There are many online versions of ludo available these days. So, I pinged my school friends to play with me and with real time chat facilities, it was like a mini reunion for all of us,” said Preetesh Sharma, a developer based in Gachibowli.
