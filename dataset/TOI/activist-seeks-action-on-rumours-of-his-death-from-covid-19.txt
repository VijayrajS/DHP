MADURAI: Seventy-one-year-old activist A Sankaralingam, 71, of Kovilpatti town in Tuticorin district has lodged a complaint with the police on Friday seeking action against miscreants who spread rumours on social media stating that he had died of Covid-19.


“Last night (Thursday), a few friends called me to check if I am alright and told me that a message was going around on social media stating that I died of coronavirus. I was shocked to see the message forwarded by them. My friends shared a number from which the message was shared on WhatsApp. I have shared the message and number to the police. It was agonising for me and my family,” he said.

The activist who is the founder of Fifth Pillar, an organisation that has been fighting encroachments and other issues in Kovilpatti for more than a decade, suspected that it could be the work of some miscreant affected by his activism. 

The Kovilpatti East police is conducting inquiries.
