Waste generated from quarantine centres discarded in open, locals fear Covid-19 outbreak

DEHRADUN: The nearly 8km stretch of Petroleum University road from Nanda Ki Chowki to Bidholi is lined with hostels, which once housed students and now serve as quarantine centres for returnees, many of whom have tested positive for Covid-19. Waste generated from these quarantine centres ends up at Paundha village on the outskirts of Dehradun. On Sunday, a video of stray animals scavenging through the waste lying in the open in Paundha village went viral. Local residents say it is a disaster in the making, as their livestock could consume it and strays may scatter it, triggering an outbreak. 

According to locals, 22 people from Rudraprayag, who were quarantined in one of the hostels, had tested positive for coronavirus, as had several other people staying in the adjoining isolation centres. 

Fearing their livestock might be infected by Covid-19, villagers have burnt the waste. “We were shocked to see monkeys, dogs, cows and buffaloes feeding on the waste generated from the quarantine centres,” said Himanshu Kumar, a native of Paundha.

Advisory from the ministry of environment stipulates that wildlife has to be kept safe from coronavirus, which is why reserves and national parks have remained closed since March. Upset with the development, forest officials told TOI that the negligence could attract action under the Indian Forest Act, 1926 and Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, as monkeys could also be seen scavenging through the garbage.

Sudhir Panchwan, the village pradhan, said, “They have been dumping waste for a long time in our village. We deployed some people to catch them in the act on Saturday. When we did spot some men discarding garbage from the quarantine centres, they fled the spot, leaving their car behind.”

The district administration, however, was in denial. 

Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Shrivastava said, “We have issued a show cause notice to the contractor for not bringing the issue to the notice of the zila panchayat authorities, so it could have been resolved. We have asked the parties to resolve the issue among themselves, as the waste generated by the quarantine centre doesn’t qualify as biomedical waste as per guidelines of the government and Paundha village is the spot demarcated for its disposal.”

The DM’s claim that the waste generated by the quarantine centre doesn’t qualify as biomedical waste was contradicted by SP Subudhi, member secretary, Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board.

“Under Section V of the Environment Protection Act, we have issued clear instructions to the directors of health and urban development departments, as well as all district magistrates and chief medical officers, to ensure that waste generated due to the Covid-19 pandemic is disposed of as per CPCB guidelines,” Subudhi said.

According to him, biomedical waste is supposed to be either buried or incarcerated or left at the nearest hospital. Premnagar government hospital, which is barely 3 km away from Petroleum University road, is the closest to the quarantine centres.
