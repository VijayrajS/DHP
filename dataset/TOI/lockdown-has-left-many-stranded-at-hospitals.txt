Hyderabad: Lockdown has left many stranded at hospitals
2020-03-29
HYDERABAD: The nationwide lockdown has left many patients from other states, who were discharged from hospitals, stranded there in absence of transport facilities.


The lockdown has had a huge impact on many, particularly the poor, as they have scarce resources to find accommodation in the city. Attendants of most patients are staying in the hospital or sheds nearby.


 

According to social activist Kiran, who works for the cause of migrants, many people from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and districts across Telangana come to Hyderabad for treatment. “I saw a woman from Odisha near Secunderabad Railway Station, whose bag and money were stolen and she had no food. She was left stranded at the station with her family and was waiting for support. She had gone to Mumbai for treatment before coming to Hyderabad,” he said.

Members of women and transgender joint action committee have written to the government requesting an advisory to the hospitals to arrange an ambulance or private transport to help such patients.
