Covid-19 cases in Raj Bhavan, will cabinet expansion go online?
2020-05-29
BHOPAL: With six staff and residents of Raj Bhavan testing positive for Covid-19 and a part of it turned into containment zone, where will the expected cabinet expansion take place? And will it be delayed because of this?

Over 100 officials and employees working in Governor House are being tested for Coronavirus and the staff quarters is out of bounds, said an official. The swearing-in of ministers, if the cabinet is expanded in the next few days, can still take place on the lawns or in the auditorium, where the first five ministers were sworn in on April 21.

But this expansion is going to a big one â€“ at least 25 ministers are expected to be sworn in. If the auditorium falls short, the event can move to Minto Hall, the assembly or even online, said an official.

Raj Bhavan officials said they can very well organize the ceremony on campus but there has been no official communication from the government yet.
