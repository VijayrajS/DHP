2020-05-26
MADHEPURA/PATNA: Nine migrant workers, who had returned to their native villages under Kumarkhand block in Madhepura district last week, have been booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for shifting to a different quarantine centre without obtaining permission from the authorities concerned.

SHO of Srinagar police station Ravish Ranjan said an FIR was lodged against the nine migrant workers hailing from different villages under Ramnagar Mahesh panchayat on the statement of Kumarkhand circle officer Jai Prakash Rai.

Legal action against the migrant workers was initiated after a video went viral on social media on May 20 in which migrant workers were seen blaming the local administrative officers for their plight at a quarantine centre set up on the campus of a government high school.

The migrant workers claimed in the viral video, the authenticity of which TOI has not verified, that they were staying in 14-day quarantine without any assistance either from the local mukhiya or the district administration.

The migrants were supposed to stay in a quarantine centre located at the government middle school and not in the high school, where they were found.

“At present, these migrants are staying in a quarantine centre at the block headquarters,” the SHO added.
