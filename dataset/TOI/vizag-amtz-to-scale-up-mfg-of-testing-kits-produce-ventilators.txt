2020-04-09
VISAKHAPATNAM: Think3D, a medical equipment manufacturing facility under the aegis of the Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ) in Visakhapatnam, will start mass production of Covid-19 testing kits including face shields, ventilator splitters, and other machined components. The facility was virtually launched by chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy from his camp office in Vijayawada on Wednesday.


Industries minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said the facility, as of now, manufactures 2,000 testing kits per day. “Once it gets the laser welding equipment, the production will be scaled up to 25,000 units per day. Starting from April 15, for the first time in India, AMTZ will produce ventilators also. It will start with 3,000 ventilators a month which will soon be scaled up to 5,000 units per month,” he said.

The minister further said that about 20 tests can be done with each kit. “The cost of each kit would be Rs 1,200. By May, around 7.5 lakh kits would be manufactured and delivered to other states as well. The central government has already placed orders for 3,500 ventilators and assembling of the units will start from April 15. The state government is planning to scale up the supply of kits so that 4,000 tests can be conducted a day. DNA, RNA, PCR tests can also be done through these kits and the results can be known in 55 minutes,” he added.

Special chief secretary Rajath Bhargava said ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has given its approval for kits to be manufactured at AMTZ. “The drug controller general of India has granted exemption from manufacturing approvals for ventilators in view of the crisis. As a token of support, the commerce and industries department is donating 1,000 Covid-19 kits and 10,000 litres of hand sanitizers to the government,” he said.
