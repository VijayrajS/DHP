2020-06-10
HYDERABAD: With Covid-19 cases seeing an unprecedented rise in Greater Hyderabad areas and districts, especially after the return of people from foreign countries, the state government has now decided to expand the Covid-19 treatment base. District-level offices will now head Covid-19 wards and Nizamabad Government General Hospital is all set to become the first government Covid-19 treatment centre in Telangana outside Hyderabad.

Nizamabad was one of the hotspot districts along with Suryapet and Rangareddy which had recorded more than 60 Covid cases. Following the relaxation in lockdown guidelines, there has been a spurt in positive cases among migrant workers in the district which shares a border with the worst-hit Maharashtra. Officials told TOI that GGH being a big facility could serve patients from Kamareddy and Jagtial districts.

Till now, those who tested positive for coronavirus were sent to Hyderabad in ambulances. On Tuesday, collector C Narayana Reddy visited the virology lab, which is getting ready. Sources said 300 to 500 tests can be conducted once the lab is fully operational. According to officials, the testing equipment has arrived.

“At present, 200 beds for Covid-19 patients are kept ready,” said the collector. The GGH has five ventilators exclusive for Covid patients. About 30 beds are ready with oxygen support for critical patients. “Soon, the health department will allocate another 15 ventilators to the hospital,” an official said.
