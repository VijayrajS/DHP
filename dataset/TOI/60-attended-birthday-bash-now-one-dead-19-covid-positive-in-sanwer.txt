INDORE: Nineteen people from the same family, who had attended a birthday party in Sanwer, near Indore, have turned out Covid-positive, sparking panic in their locality, where they had come in contact with many people in the days since. 

What's amped up the panic is that a 70-year-old woman of the family died on May 23, seven days after attending the party. Her death sent officials scrambling to trace her contacts, and the discovery of the birthday party. 

The youngest of those infected is an 18-month-old baby, and the oldest a 60-year-old man. "Around 50-60 people had attended the party," said Sanwer block medical officer Dr Hemant Raghuvanshi.

The woman's son had brought her to Sanwer Hospital on May 21 to have her checked for cough, cold and fever, said the BMO. "She was a resident of Dhar Road in Indore and had visited her relative's house in Badodiyakhan village for the party on May 16," said Raghuvanshi.

Doctors immediately identified Covid-19 symptoms and sent her to MY Hospital in Indore, where she died on May 23. Her Covid test came positive the same day.

The administration rushed a health team to Badodiyakhan village, about 40km from Indore.

"Nineteen of her relatives, who had attended the party, gave their samples at MY Hospital on May 23 and their report came positive today," said Raghuvanshi. Most of them are asymptomatic. Seventeen of them have been shifted to MRTB Hospital and two to a Covid care facility at Sewakunj Hospital.

"We roped in half a dozen health department teams and surveyed 500 houses in the area. Thirteen Covid-19 suspects were detected and we took their samples," " said SDM Ravish Shrivastava.

Before this, Sanwer tehsil, just beyond the outskirts of Indore, had reported nine Covid-19 cases, including two deaths.
