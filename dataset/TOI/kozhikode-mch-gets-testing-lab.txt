KOZHIKODE: The government medical college hospital (MCH), on Tuesday, commenced the testing of swabs collected from suspected Covid-19 cases. The laboratory to test these swabs was arranged at the virology research and diagnostic centre’s biosafety level-II (BSL-II) lab, which comes under the department of microbiology. 

According to MCH authorities, the lab commenced its operation by conducting tests on six samples received on March 10 and all the six of them tested negative for Covid-19. 

Kozhikode MCH principal Dr V R Rajendran said, “The lab will carry out tests on all samples received at the lab from north Malabar and other districts in the state. The facility will help to provide the test results within five hours of receiving the samples,” he said. 

Meanwhile, KGMCH superintendent Dr K G Sajeeth Kumar said that the hospital collects swab and blood samples from people belonging to high-risk groups. “Hospital authorities will keep the suspected person belonging to high-risk group under 14 days’ observation even if the test turns negative. In case, if the test results turn positive then the samples will be sent to Pune-based National Institute of Virology for reconfirmation,” he said. 

With the new lab, district health department here need not send the collected samples from suspected patients to NIV lab at Alappuzha Medical College Hospital.
