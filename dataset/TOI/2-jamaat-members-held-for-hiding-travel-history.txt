ROORKEE: Two men were booked by city police on Friday under “attempt to murder” charges for concealing their participation in the Tablighi Jamaat event this year. The men are natives of a village near Laksar town.


The health department has sent the two men to a quarantine facility in Piran Kaliyar for 14 days and has collected their samples for Covid-19 test.

According to Abhinav Sharma, senior sub-inspector of Laksar police, two men, both in their early twenties, had gone to the Markaz event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin on January 13. Later, they moved to Kanpur for 40 days and then came to Uttarakhand. “It is mandatory for people, who have taken part in any Jamaat event this year, to report to us but the two accused didn’t disclose their travel history to police before April 6 despite DGP’s warning,” said Sharma.

The accused have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 188 (disobedience of magistrate order), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), and 270 (spread infectious diseases), and 336 (endangering act to the safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
