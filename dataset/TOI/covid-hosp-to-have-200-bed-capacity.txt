Covid hosp to have 200+ bed capacity
2020-05-21
Margao: Mattresses and pillows were moved to the Covid-19 hospital in Margao on Wednesday as part of efforts to increase the capacity to 200-plus beds from the present 170-bed capacity. “Now the beds only need to be assembled,” an official said.

Health secretary Nila Mohanan said the plan is to increase the bed capacity to 220. At the moment 170 beds are already ready, she said.

Emphasis is also being laid on increasing sufficient number of oxygen beds.

Covid-19 patients who are serious will have to be given oxygen first and only if that option fails, will they be shifted to ventilator support, she said. 

The hospital has a paediatric ward and paediatric ICU besides the adult ICU. At present, symptomatic and asymptomatic patients have been placed in different wards, on different floors. 

The hospital’s capacity was increased from 100 to 170 on Tuesday after the weekend saw a huge spurt in cases from those who entered by road. The Rajdhani trains that came in over the weekend itself brought in 23 positive patients. Contact tracing is still on to test more of those who came into contact with these positive patients.
