2020-06-10
HYDERABAD: A mix-up of bodies of Covid-19 victims caused mild tension at a graveyard in Begumpet on Tuesday. After a victim’s family discovered the goof-up, they protested and got into a verbal duel with civic staff. GHMC staff sent the body back to Gandhi Hospital and promised to complete the final rites on Wednesday morning. 

A 48-year-old Covid-19 patient from Begumpet, undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital, succumbed on Tuesday. As the GHMC staff brought the body for the last rites, the victim’s wife discovered that it was not her husband’s body and raised an alarm. An argument broke out between the family and the four GHMC employees responsible for handling the body.

A GHMC source claimed the family members assaulted one of the staff. GHMC officials, however, denied the incident. “There was an argument, but they did not assault the staff,” a GHMC official said.

As per norms after a relative of the person sees the body through a glass partition and identifies it in the presence of police, the body is sent from hospital. At the graveyard, the body is shown to five family members from a distance. However, the family is not allowed to touch the body.

In the present case, the body was dispatched by Gandhi Hospital staff and police to Begumpet for the last rites. “The body was dispatched only after a relative of the deceased identified it. The relative in the presence of medical staff and police confirmed that the body belongs to his family member. After that it was sent for the last rites,” an official deployed on Covid-19 duty told TOI. “He failed to identify the body of his relative,” the officer added. 

After the confusion was cleared, the civic officials sent back the body to Gandhi Hospital with a promise that the last rites of the 48-year-old would be conducted on Wednesday.
