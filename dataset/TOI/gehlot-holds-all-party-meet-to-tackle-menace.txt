JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday convened an all-party meeting and invited all religious leaders at chief minister’s office to discuss the threat of coronavirus and devise ways and means to tackle it.

Gehlot asked the religious leaders of various communities to spread awareness among devotees visiting holy places and advise them of the precautions to be taken against the virus. The religious leaders also issued an appeal asking devotees to avoid visiting religious places and festivals. 

He said the situation in the state is under control but the next two three weeks are very crucial in containing the disease. 

“Holding all-party meeting at CMO to discuss the threat of coronavirus and to collectively deal with it. Informed the leaders about the steps taken by the state government to deal with the disease so far,” Gehlot tweeted.

“It is our collective responsibility to ensure that people are made aware, prepared and that everybody takes precautions,” he said. The meeting discussed political parties to minimise political meetings, events, programmes in the present situation.

“Our focus should be to ensure that the spread of the virus is contained,” he said.

Members of different political parties were present in the meeting.

At the all religious meeting the chief minister emphasized the need to keep the numbers minimum during festivals and other auspicious days.

It is important that all religious leaders convey the message to communities not to panic or fear but to focus on adopting measures to protect and save themselves, the chief minister said at the meeting.

Four coronavirus cases have been reported in the state so far and three of them have been recovered. The government has taken a slew of preventive, precautionary and remedial measures to contain the spread of the virus and to deal with the situation.
