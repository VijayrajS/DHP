Delhi HC found no ‘fabrication’ of Covid-19 death data
2020-05-25
NEW DELHI: While disposing of a PIL that sought scrapping of the death audit committee (DAC) of the Delhi government on Covid-19 cases and a direction to the government to come out with “actual” figure of cases and death count, Delhi high court has ruled that it seems there is neither any arbitrariness or discrimination, nor any material to show fabrication of data on the part of the authorities.

It said the members of the committee were experts in their subject and that data was being collected from hospitals in a proper format and on the basis of guidelines issued by the Centre. The bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Prateek Jalan observed that the entire case of the petitioner was based on presumptions and surmises on the basis of newspaper reports.

The bench, however, clarified that it would expect the DAC and the government to publish data only after it was properly analysed. It also directed that the data be maintained properly by the committee and government.

The PIL had been filed by All India Lawyers’ Union. It had sought a direction to the Delhi government to publish the data related to confirmed cases of Covid-19 and deaths through a daily bulletin, claiming that there was a huge discrepancy between the actual information provided by the various hospitals and the figures being released by the Delhi government.

In a statement referring to the court order, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha on Sunday said “Delhi High Court had upheld the accuracy and sanctity of the death figures published by the AAP government”. Accusing the BJP of “playing dirty politics”, he said the party must apologise to the people and the Delhi government for indulging in a baseless, motivated and malicious campaign.
