Vadodara: Ajay Rathwa, a student of Class V at Potiya village in Chhota Udepur, spends his day helping his mother or playing around due to lockdown. But as clock strikes 5 every evening, Ajay takes his father’s phone and talks to his school principal for his daily lesson.Even as the state government has mass promoted students up to Class IX and of Class XI, around 40 students of Potiya village’s primary school are enthusiastic to churn their brains in lockdown.School principal Mukesh Upadhyay took up the task of conducting online classes through WhatsApp video calls so that students do not forget their lessons. “A week into the lockdown, I thought of conducting classes and by then the government too appealed to conduct online classes,” said Upadhyay. He added that there was a parents’ group and once it gave its consent for online classes, they were immediately started.“There is an attachment with students as well as their parents because I have been teaching in this village for last 25 years. Before I started the classes, they used to contact me asking me about my well-being and I used to pass on the dos and don’ts about the lockdown,” Upadhyay said. “I have only been revising what the students have learned in past one year and even conducting their oral tests. Some time I ask parents to write a few questions for the students and send me a video of it,” he added. So far, Upadhyay has covered subjects like mathematics, English and Gujarati.“The lockdown will end next month, but there is still time for schools to reopen so until then children will continue learning and remain busy,” Upadhyay told TOI.
