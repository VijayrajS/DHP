HYDERABAD: If police, sanitary workers, farmers and government employees are working to keep essential services running during the lockdown, K Shashidhar Reddy, 49, of Chaitanyapuri in Dilsukhnagar, keeps them going, providing piping hot breakfast every morning. He has been doing this since March 28. Steaming hot idli, vada, upma, pongal, and tomato bath are on the menu and he himself delivers them in neat packs. 


For the last 23 days, he has also been providing breakfast to 100 migrants who live around Dilsukhnagar . An MBA graduate, Shashidhar Reddy got into cable TV business 29 years ago. “I felt I have to do my bit and started providing breakfast to 20 people, but now it is almost 400 people everyday,” he says. “Initially, I thought I could spend up to a certain amount of money, but having seen how much people are satisfied when I take them breakfast, I decided to continue,” he said. Some of his friends liked the idea and contribute provisions. For Shashidhar Reddy, it is a race against time everyday. He does not delay the breakfast as he knows the people he serves regularly would be hungry.
