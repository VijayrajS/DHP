2020-06-07
MOHALI: Under the Unlock 1.0 phase, the Mohali administration has allowed to open places of worship, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services and shopping malls – albeit significant safeguards. There will be no dine-in facilities in restaurants and eateries. Only home deliveries and takeaways will be allowed.





Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, while issuing orders for Unlock 1.0, said community food will not be served at places of worship across the district until further orders. The relaxation under Unlock 1.0 will come into force from Monday. The DC said places of worship will be opened between 5 am and 8 pm. Only 20 devotees will be allowed at a time.

“The temple authorities will have to take care of proper sanitisation of the premises. Each devotee will have to pass through the sanitisation process. The place where devotees would bow to pay their obeisance must also be sanitised every time. No community food or prashad will be served to devotees,” he said.

Restaurants and bars in hotels will remain closed, but food will be served to guests in hotel rooms. 

There will be no dine-in facility at any restaurant or eatery, however, takeaways and home deliveries will be allowed.
