2020-04-11
HYDERABAD: The state cabinet is meeting on Saturday and likely to take a decision on extending the lockdown from April 14 till the month-end. 


The special cabinet meeting will also take stock of the prevailing situation due to the coronavirus pandemic and the spike in positive cases.

Sources in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to announce or at least indicate extending the national-level lockdown during his video-conference with chief ministers on Saturday morning. “If the Centre’s decision is delayed or if it is willing to ease the lockdown, the cabinet will discuss the matter at 3 pm and take a decision,” sources said.

Officials pointed out that states like Odisha have already extended the lockdown till April 30 without waiting for Centre’s decision and the state government may go the Odisha way if there is no clarity from the Centre. On Friday, Punjab extended the lockdown till May 1.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had already announced that his government is in favour of extending the lockdown for at least two weeks. Health minister Eatala Rajender has also expressed similar views on extension and said the state would be free of coronavirus cases by the end of this month. “The government’s view is that lockdown should be lifted only if there are zero cases at least for a week,” a senior official of the government said.

Officials said apart from the lockdown, the cabinet meeting would mainly discuss the financial situation. The CM will seek financial support from the Centre in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. The cabinet is also likely to take a decision on the academic calendar year, examinations for lower classes and SSC exams. Apart from reviewing measures for migrant workers, the government may announce measures for farmers who lost their crops.
