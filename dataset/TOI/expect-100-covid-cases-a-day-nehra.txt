Expect 100 Covid-19 cases a day in Ahmedabad: Vijay Nehra
2020-04-17
AHMEDABAD: The number of new Covid-19 cases reported in the city in the last 24 hours has hit 95 and the city will soon see more than 100 cases being reported every day. Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra said that with their intensive surveillance and aggressive testing strategy, the number of new cases reported in the city every day will cross 100 in the near future.


Nehra also called on citizens to maintain at least a 10-foot distance from others and treat every citizen as a potential Covid-19 case. “We are in a situation where we have to think the next person is Covid-19 positive and can infect you. I appeal to citizens to maintain social distancing and wear masks whenever they go out,” he said.

With the 95 cases reported on Thursday, the city’s tally is now 545 cases. Nehra said people should take the situation very seriously and go out only if absolutely necessary. 

In Behrampura and Danilimda areas which are under curfew, large numbers of women go out to buy milk and vegetables. “I request the citizens not to insist on buying vegetables fresh every day. The situation is grim as the virus is spreading further by the day. Even with no symptoms are being found to be infected,” he said.

 Nehra said that the number of new cases will also rise as the AMC has also increased the number of tests being conducted. In a single day on Wednesday, the AMC collected 1,247 samples, the highest daily number so far. In the last 24 hours, the AMC carried out health check-ups in 1.07 lakh houses and screened 4.59 lakh people. 

The screening was done by 747 AMC teams. With intensive surveillance and aggressive testing the number is going to increase. “Think positive and stay negative,” said Nehra. He explained that one must assume the other person is positive and maintain a distance so that one remains Covid-19 negative.
