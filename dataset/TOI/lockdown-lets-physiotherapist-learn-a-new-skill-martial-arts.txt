Lockdown lets physiotherapist learn a new skill: Martial arts!
2020-04-20
VADODARA: Hectic college schedule did not allow physiotherapy student Krishna Kondhiya to learn martial arts, which she had been longing for years. 


Lockdown has, however, given her the opportunity to learn the self-defence art.

Krishna is being trained by her younger brother Nikunj, who is a student of martial arts for the last three years. 

“It gives a lot of energy, increases confidence and also helps in self-protection so I always wanted to learn it, but due to studies I could never join a formal training course,” said Krishna, who lives in Ellora Park. As lockdown came into effect, Nikunj decided to train her in martial arts as well as other exercises.

“I have learned stick rolling, push-up and even Surya Namaskar,” she added. “I am undergoing formal training for three years now and since everything is under lockdown, I am self-learning through videos on YouTube and helping my sister too,” Nikunj said. 

The brother-sister duo trains themselves every morning in the compound of their house.

“The self-protecting techniques and exercise will also help her in strengthening her physique,” said Nikunj, who is doing a diploma engineering course from a private college in the city.
