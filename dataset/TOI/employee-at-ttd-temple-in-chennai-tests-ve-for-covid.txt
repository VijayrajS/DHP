In a communique sent by T Muralidhar, assistant executive officer at TTD’s Chennai temple to TTD’s deputy executive officer (general) at Tirupati, the official said that a paricharika—an outsourced employee—who was on duty from May4-7, went for a medical check-up after he fell sick on May 18. 

The paricharika tested for Covid-19, the results of which came back positive on May 20.

As the paricharika has a wife and elederly parents living with him, both of whom are bedridden, he is undergoing home quarantine in consultation with the Apollo Hospitals in Chennai.

After the temple officials informed TTD’s Chennai local advisory committee (LAC) president J Sekhar Reddy of the development, arrangements were made to sanitise and disinfect the TTD temple and information centre premises at Chennai. Staff working at the temple and information centre were also instructed to undergo medical checkup for Covid-19 with the help of the Chennai LAC.

President of the Chennai LAC underlined that the paricharika was not on duty when he fell sick or tested positive for Covid-19. 

“As a precautionary measure, all staff working here have been advised to undergo COVID-19 screening immediately,” J Sekhar Reddy said.
