AHMEDABAD: Umang Patel of Gandhinagar was discharged after recovering from Covid-19 from Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad on Monday. After Patel, nine of his extended family members had contacted infection and one of the elderly members had died of the virus.

Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) officials claimed that now the city area does not have any active positive case, and all other cases are in pockets of the districts. As on Tuesday evening, Gandhinagar had recorded a total of 17 positive cases, out of which 11 were discharged and two had succumbed to the infection, leaving four active patients.

“Patel was the first to have been diagnosed and the last to have been discharged. His wife, brother and grandmother responded well to the treatment and were declared free of the infection before him. All are healthy now and are taking proper precautions,” said a GMC official.

State health department officials said that out of 33 districts of Guajrat, 28 have so far recorded at least one case. The figure was 10 at the start of April. “However, 11 districts have less than five cases and three have only one. In such cases, the source of infection is identified quickly so that the further spread can be arrested. Testing in these districts has also been extended so that more cases can be detected early,” said an official.

Experts point out that precautions for when the lockdown ends are necessary in the industrial clusters. “Massive testing will not be possible at such a scale and ways have to be devised at the unit level that persons from other parts of the state or country are screened properly to control the number of cases,” said an official.
