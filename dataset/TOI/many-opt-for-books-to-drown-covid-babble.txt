Visakhapatnam: Many opt for books to drown Covid-19 babble
2020-04-24
VISAKHAPATNAM: The habit of reading a book, which is no more a popular habit among people, especially children, has made a comeback during the lockdown period. 


On World Book Day, a few Vizagites speak about their lost habit of book reading, either due to lack of time or excessive dependence on smartphones.

Heritage narrator and environment enthusiast Jayshree Hatangadi said, “With my network of friends and family members, who are interested in books, we have started a discussion forum. We speak about books we plan to read or share views on books we have already read or reading.”

People are also turning to books to avoid Covid-19 related news and debates being circulated in the social media 24x7.

“I was an avid reader of fiction novels. But once I started working I could hardly manage time and it would take me several months to complete one novel. But now, I am optimising my time reading books that keep me hooked till the end like Robin Cook’s medical mysteries or other detective novels and science fiction. Reading books keeps me occupied rather than participating in depressing debates on social media,” said Bhagyasree Venugopal, who works on projects with the state forest department. 

With no scope to go out and play with friends, even children are finding solace in story books. Advocate Rahimunnisa Begum said, “My 10-year-old daughter Shabana Parveen is spending her time reading books and making crafts and abacus. She’s hooked onto bed time stories for children, Akbar and Birbal and Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.”
