Coronavirus in Chennai: Police clip wings of lockdown violators with drones
2020-05-02
CHENNAI: Three quadcopters covering a 13sqkm area from above for 14 days have given police a peek into the ways people are violating the lockdown in containment zones. 

The Greater Chennai police engaged an aerial photographer and experts to study the pattern of movement from April 13 to 27. The drones captured 500GB high-resolution videos. On analysis, it was found that among Mannady, Pudupet, Chinthadripet and Triplicane â€“ areas with high cases -- people in Mannady came out of their homes the most. 

In Mannady, 284 people stepped out of their homes, particularly between noon and 2pm to buy groceries or interact with neighbours. In Pudupet, 196 people ventured out, 167 people moved around in Chinthadripet and 37 residents violated the lockdown in Triplicane.

But the analysis helped the police department change its patrolling strategies and barricade positions. Police are focusing on the directions residents have mainly taken. 

"The details helped police in diverting their force to areas where maximum violations were observed," said R R Sivaraman, S Team, the firm that volunteered to provide the drone service.

"After a week-long exercise along the main roads, interior streets were in areas such as Pudupet. The movement of people has come down now," said joint commissioner, East zone, R Sudhakar. 

More drones will be operated in these areas to ensure residents remain indoors. Soon a monitoring room will be set up for live mapping instructing the ground force. 

"We felt that containment zones need more focus to contain the spread. Additional studies will help us in finding a pattern of undue movement and prevent it," said Chennai police commissioner A K Vishwanathan.
