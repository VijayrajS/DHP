Rajkot: A woman who was home quarantined after returning from Chicago in the USA was booked on Friday after she went missing from her home in Kings Heights Apartments on Amin Marg Road in Rajkot since Thursday morning. 

Police said the accused, identified as Eva Khanpara (20), had been put under home quarantine since March 17. 

“We spoke to Eva’s father Sanjay Khanpara who said that Eva was with her family members in his village,” said J S Champavat, sub-inspector with Malaviyanagar police station. 

“I forgot to ask the name of the village. However, once we find the location, we will go there and detain Eva and transfer her to the government quarantine,” said Champavat, adding that Eva had been booked for the violation of the government’s Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897.
