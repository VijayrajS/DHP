Coronavirus: Ketevan fest postponed after Goa health mantri intervenes
2020-03-13
PANAJI: A day after TOI reported that health minister Vishwajit Rane asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to cancel the Ketevan Sacred Music Festival in view of the spread of Covid-19, the event has been postponed. The festival team released a statement on Thursday that the event would be rescheduled “after analysing the situation at a future date” and would be celebrated after the crisis passed.


“Since the core spirit of our festival has always been to promote peaceful co-existence, we are keen to follow all the health and travel guidelines stated by the Indian government to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the statement read.

The festival, featuring international artistes flying in from various parts of the world, was scheduled to be held from Friday to Sunday.

This year’s line-up at the Ketevan Sacred Music Festival was set to feature over 70 talented artists from Argentina, Spain, the UK, France, Georgia, Australia, Japan, Russia, Vietnam, Portugal and Switzerland besides India, even as many countries around the globe are in the throes of the Covid-19 scare.

Though Goa has not yet seen a confirmed case of Covid-19, the fear of the virus spreading at mass gatherings has led to the cancellation of major events. Even the upcoming Hero Indian Super League (ISL) final between ATK FC and Chennaiyin FC will be played behind closed doors at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, Fatorda.

While many institutions worldwide cancelled their events in view of the coronavirus scare, the Ketevan organisers were keen to go ahead. This was until TOI reported on March 12 that Rane asked Sawant to direct the organisers to postpone the festival until further notice.

The festival’s team soon released the statement postponing the festival. “We hope and pray that the virus is contained soon so that the world can be at peace.” the statement further read.
