2020-01-19
Chennai: All passengers arriving at airports in the state will be screened for influenza-like symptoms to pick possible cases of new coronavirus identified in China.

Health minister C Vijayabaskar said the state was working to prevent cross-border spread of the new strain and that the department has strengthened health infrastructure and resources to handle emergencies. “We will be doing a routine thermal screening of passengers arriving at our airports. Medical teams are stationed at the airports to help passengers,” he said. Warning signs for the new strain, like other influenza viruses, includes fever, cough and breathing difficulties, while more advanced cases could lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death.

The state has also sent available educational material about the virus to doctors’ bodies to ensure they identify cases early. Tests for the new virus will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) lab, officials said. The new strain of coronavirus belongs to the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). “We are told that as of now it has been detected in Wuhan in central China. We are being cautious, aware and practising usual precautions. There is no panic as of now,” said state health secretary Beela Rajesh.

Meanwhile, director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy said although screening is being done by authorities at airports, better benefits have been seen when people with a respiratory illnesses seek medical attention and share travel history with doctors. “Outbreaks of SARS, H1N1 and other such epidemics have seen better outcomes when people seek treatment,” he said.
