Trichy: The city corporation has assigned an exclusive team of sanitary workers and vehicles to collect and dispose waste from houses having people under home quarantine. The civic body said that the separate waste collection mechanism was initiated on Friday as a precautionary move and to allay fears among neighbours. The urban local body has allotted at least two vehicles in each of the four zones here for the exclusive door-to-door waste collection from around 2,000 quarantined houses in the city as on Friday. Each zone will be allotted up to four sanitary workers.The sanitary workers and vehicles will be disinfected before and after collection of waste. “Though it is not proven that novel coronavirus may spread through waste, we do not want to take any chances. Since nearby residents are apprehensive over common waste collection practice, we initiated the separate waste collection process,” an official with the corporation said. Unlike the routine waste collection, the civic body said that the waste collected from the houses under isolation will be incinerated at the micro compost centres. “People under home-quarantine are extremely cooperative to the exclusive waste collection process,” a sanitary official with Trichy Corporation added.Sanitary workers collecting waste from quarantine homes have been provided with face masks and hand gloves. The workers are periodically disinfected, the official added.
