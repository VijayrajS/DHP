2020-05-05
MYSURU: After a worrisome surge in the number of cases in the district in the last week of March and the early days of April, Mysuru has managed to put a lid on the spread of Covid-19. What is more, the number of active cases in Mysuru has been on a downward slide, and on Monday, two more patients were discharged from the designated Covid-19 hospital in Mysuru, pushing the number down to 11. 


Of the 90 individuals who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Mysuru district, 79 have recovered and been discharged – the second highest in Karnataka. Health department officials in Mysuru said that more patients were slated for discharge on Tuesday, which is likely to bring the number of active cases down to single digit. 

Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar appreciated the efforts taken by the Mysuru district administration for its success in curbing the outbreak. “We must compliment the Mysuru district administration for the manner in which the authorities have handled the crisis. They were worried a few days ago but they are now confident of being classified as a ‘Green Zone’ district,” the minister said. 

The Nanjangud ‘cluster case’ accounted for 74 of the 90 cases in Mysuru district.
