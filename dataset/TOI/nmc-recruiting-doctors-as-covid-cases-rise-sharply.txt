NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started the process to recruit more doctors on a war footing as the number of Covid-19 cases are fast rising in the city. 


Civic officials said that 500 doctors — allopathic, ayurvedic and Unani — are being appointed and that they are already in the process to recruit 200. The remaining will be appointed in phases shortly. The civic body presently has 192 doctors. 

“We have 100 beds, including 50 ICU, in Zakir Hussain Hospital for Covid patients. We are increasing the capacity to 160 beds, which will include 50 ICUs,” said the officials.

The NMC is also creating wards with 300 beds in the new Bytco hospital building. 

The officials said that infrastructure is in place to treat 1,000 patients at a time. “We have reserved around 70 beds in major hospitals and are in talks with three private hospitals where 125 beds may be reserved within two days.”
