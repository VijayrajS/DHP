Ahmedabad: With coronavirus pandemic likely to impact the habits of car buyers in the country, SAIC owned MG Motor India is planning to strengthen its online strategy to minimize human interaction by delivering the vehicle at your doorsteps.

“Post coronavirus there may be profound impact on consumer behaviour. While there would be high concerns for air quality, the online search and online buying will also increase,” said Rajeev Chaba, president and MD of MG Motor India. 

While the company already has a provision for online booking of vehicles, it’s presently working on developing an end-to-end seamless online shopping vertical. “This should be ready in a few weeks,” said Chaba.

From selection of accessories, price quotation, buying insurance, registration and even finance options can be availed online if a customer chooses. The vehicle will be sanitised and delivered by a driver covered with Covid-19 protection kit, he said.

The carmaker has launched a ‘Disinfect and Deliver’ initiative to ensure car deliveries and test drives at customers’ homes under a completely sanitised process. The staff at its dealerships have also been trained to take all the necessary steps to ensure that the service workshops and showrooms are completely sanitised.

To address growing concerns of air quality in the wake of Covid-19 scare, MG Motor has partnered with Singapore-based Medklinn to explore natural sterilisation of cabin air and surfaces in its cars.
