2020-06-11
PATNA: State health department on Wednesday made major changes in sample collection process of Covid-19 suspects as well as discharge policy for corona positive people.

Principal secretary (health) Udai Singh Kumawat late on Wednesday evening, Now symptomatic people will not be brought to quarantine centres for taking their samples. A team will rather collect the samples, according to a letter written by principal secretary (health) Udai Singh Kumawat to all DMs and civil surgeons (CS) on Wednesday.

All symptomatic people will now be home quarantined. In case of a positive report, they will be transferred to isolation centres as per the rule. Also, mild cases of Covid-19 will now be discharged from isolation centres in government hospitals without any test after 10 days of showing the symptoms. However, it has to be seen that people who are to be discharged did not have fever in the last three days. Till now, all the positive cases were discharged only after testing negative for Covid-19.

“In case of any symptom after being discharged, they will inform health officials,” the letter reads.

In case of severe cases, which include HIV patients, transplant recipients and malignancy, patients will be discharged after clinical recovery and with one negative RT-PCR test. ICMR had relaxed discharging criteria for Covid-19 on May 9 and Centre had sent a relaxed discharging parameters to all states.

However, Bihar government had, on May 14, tweaked this norm and decided to undertake at least one RT-PCR test before discharging any Covid-19 positive person. Earlier, all positive people had to undergo two RT-PCR tests and were discharged if two reports came negative.
