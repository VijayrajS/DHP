2020-03-15
With hundreds of events, concerts and matches being cancelled or postponed all around the globe in the wake of Coronavirus pandemic, a popular event in Kanpur to join the list is Techkriti 2020, the technical festival of IIT-Kanpur. Despite the fact that there has been no confirmed case of Coronavirus in Kanpur, the institute administration has decided to postpone the four-day long annual festival, which was slated to start from Thursday, March 19. 
Giving more information on this, a member of the Techkriti organising committee says, “Techkriti is one of the biggest technical festival across India and every year it turns out to be an attraction among the participants for its events, technical competitions, summits, conclaves and music shows. Every year the technical festival of IIT Kanpur attracts a large number of students of other institutes from across India. This time too we were expecting the participation of around two thousand students from different parts of the country. The festival also has artists and participants from foreign countries as well. We havn't yet decided the new dates, once the effect of Coronavirus minimizes, we will figure out new dates and would be announcing them.” 
Like every year this year too Techkriti was a much-awaited event for the participants. “Every year the festival has a number of eminent speakers from different fields. This year too we had speakers like Indian mathematician Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan Dr MS Raghunathan, Indian nuclear physicist Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan Dr Bikash Sinha, Dr John C Mather, American astrophysicist, Dr Rajendra Singh, Indian environmentalist, Pete Michels, American animation director and S Somnath, Director Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. Now, since the festival has been postponed, we have to again work on the availability of the dates of the speakers,” informs, another key member of the Techkriti organising committee.
