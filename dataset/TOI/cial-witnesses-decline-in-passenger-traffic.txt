Coronavirus scare: Kochi airport witnesses decline in passenger traffic
2020-03-12
KOCHI: The Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) is witnessing a huge decline in the number of passengers in the wake of heightened Covid-19 alert. According to sources, the airport, that usually handles around 30,000 passengers daily, now witnesses only 50% passengers, both in international and domestic sectors. While the cancellation of several international flights and stringent visa curbs by India and other countries hit the passenger flow in international sector, domestic sector is affected by cancellation of tickets. The cancellation of tour packages is also a reason behind the reduced footfalls.


“Many flights in international sectors are operating without enough passengers. The situation is more or less same in both arrival and departure sector,” said Cial spokesperson.

“The frequent change in travel rules is confusing passengers and they just don’t want to travel. We have been receiving cancellation calls even though we have given offers like rescheduling trips without penalty,” said Air India Express spokesperson.
