VADODARA: A coronavirus patient in Chhota Udepur district was discharged on Thursday as her consecutive test reports turned out to be negative.


Health officials said that of the 28 samples sent from Chhota Udepur on Wednesday, reports of 27 including the patient Sayma Khalpa (24) turned out to be negative. 

Khalpa was admitted on April 24 along with her husband Aspak Yusuf Khalpa after the couple contracted the virus from their family member Irshad Khalpa. While Sayma has been discharged, Aspak will remain under treatment as he could not give his sample on Wednesday.

With Sayma getting discharged, only two patients now remain under treatment. The other patient has been identified as Uzair Ranger. Ranger, who was admitted before the couple, has tested positive for fourth consecutive time due to which health officials are also worried.

The district had registered 14 cases of coronavirus since April 5 when a 60-year-old man had tested positive.
