Amid lockdown, students ask govt to pay exam fee
2020-05-18
Hyderabad: With Osmania University (OU) announcing the schedule for payment of examination fee for various degree courses, students are demanding that the state should bear the examination fee of all students. They said that it will be difficult for many students to pay the examination fee during lockdown period.

Students, who were asked to submit application forms and fee at their respective colleges, allege that colleges are asking them to clear fee dues in order to accept the examination fee.

“Every year, the state collects at least Rs 500 from each candidate appearing for various entrance exams. The expenditure for a student will not be more than Rs 200. The state should use this excess money and not collect any fee from students,” said P Srihari, general secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.

OU registrar Ch Gopal Reddy, meanwhile, said that they are yet to take any decision on students’ demand concerning exam fee.
