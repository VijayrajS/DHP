UDAIPUR: In a bid to spread awareness about the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, Udaipur cops are using unique corona helmets to dissuade commuters from coming out on the streets during the nationwide lockdown.

The initiative is a joint effort of Udaipur Traffic police and the lady patrol team, which was launched from Delhi Gate on Wednesday evening. The cops are driving through the streets and colonies carrying placards with slogans on coronavirus and telling people the significance of social distancing.

“Lady officers are leading the drive as all the slogans have been penned by DySP Chetna Bhati, while another deputy superintendent of police, traffic, Sudha Palawat is motivating her team of 120 cops to keep moving around the city area during morning and evening hours. Around 20 cops of the lady patrol team will take out a procession wearing these corona helmets in two shifts daily,” Chetna told TOI

“The red colour of the helmets indicates the gravity of the disease. Our cops have used candles and cotton to fabricate the normal helmet and make it look like coronavirus. A rally was taken through Delhi Gate, Chetak Circle, Jagdish Temple, Dhan Mandi and interior streets inside the Walled City area. The public response was overwhelming as people cheered us from their windows and balconies,” Udaipur SP Kailash Chandra Bishnoi told TOI.

“We take all the steps, but people still come out on the streets. Therefore, this corona helmet is one of the steps we are taking to ensure that people are aware,” Bishnoi said.

Meanwhile, in Pratapgarh, cops are resorting to Gandhigiri to keep people indoors. Cops are gifting flowers and garlanding shopkeepers who are adhering to social distancing principles in their outlets while those who found commuting, too, were garlanded and advised not to roam unnecessarily.
