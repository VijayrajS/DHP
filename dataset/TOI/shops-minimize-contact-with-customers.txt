Coronavirus in Pune: Shops minimize contact with customers
2020-03-24
PUNE: Grocery and medical stores in many parts of the city have barricaded their entrances to minimize contact with customers.


Many shops are entertaining only one customer at a time, while the others wait in a queue outside. All of this is an attempt to minimize human contact and contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, shopkeepers said. At some stores, staffers were assigned the duty of ensuring customers stand in queue and reach the counter one after the others. 

“I went out to pick up some items for home on Monday morning and was surprised to see our local store deploy a staffer outside the shop. He was telling customers to wait in line, one metre from each others. He would also send just one customer at any time to the counter,” Deccan resident Siddharth Jain said. 

A store owner from the area said,“Only one customer is allowed to come to the counter to place their order and buy whatever is needed. We are not allowing people to come inside the shop so that we can ensure that we don’t come in contact with anyone and that the virus doesn’t spread.”

Vegetable vendors were also seen taking similar precautions. 

“I went to purchase vegetables on Monday and saw that all grocers and green grocers taking such precautions. The vegetable vendor I went to functions on the premises of a larger grocery store, which is shut,” Sunita Athavale, city-based working professional, said. 

“On Monday, the vendor had closed the gate of the premises and allowed only three people in at a time. While two customers wait, one is allowed to go and pick out whatever s/he needs. They are being extremely careful,” she said. 

She added that similar scenes were to be seen outside several stores and dairy outlets. 

“Allowing one customer at a time while others wait a little far away in a line has become the norm,” she said. 

“The people too are patiently waiting in queues,” she added.
