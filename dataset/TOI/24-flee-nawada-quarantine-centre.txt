24 flee Nawada quarantine centre
2020-05-10
NAWADA: At least 24 migrant workers fled the Adarsh Inter College quarantine centre under the Sirdalla police station area in Nawada district on Friday night after one of its inmates was tested positive for coronavirus. Twenty-two of them were, however, later caught by the police and brought back to the quarantine centre.

The latest Covid-19 positive patient, the fifth in the district, was one of the 42 migrant workers who had arrived from Gujarat on Thursday and quarantined at Adarsh Inter College.

The escape of the migrants sent the administration into a tizzy. Hectic search and subsequent pacification efforts by the civil administration resulted in the return of all but two workers. Sirdalla BDO Akhishwar Singh said efforts were on to trace the two remaing migrants as well. The Covid-19 patient has since been shifted to an isolation ward at A N Medical College, Gaya.
