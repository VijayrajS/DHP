Coronavirus outbreak in Delhi: Manjinder Singh Sirsa urges Arvind Kejriwal to help out daily wagers

NEW DELHI: Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Wednesday appealed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, asking him to deposit some money into the accounts of daily wage labourers who were now unemployed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Sirsa claimed that footfall of these labourers seeking langar at gurdwaras had increased considerably over the past few weeks, putting them and others at the risk of contracting Covid-19.

The Shiromani Akali Dal functionary said most labourers had no money to buy food for their family, leaving them with no option but to approach gurdwaras.

“The number of people coming to gurdwaras has increased manifold. We have absolutely no problem in serving the community and our gates will remain open to as many people as possible. However, the greater challenge is to prevent large gatherings and putting more people at risk,” Sirsa said on Wednesday.

The DSGMC president said the situation could deteriorate if not checked immediately. “I appeal to Delhi government to transfer some money immediately into their accounts so that few people as possible gather at temples and gurdwaras across the city,” he added.

Bangla Sahib, Rakabganj Sahib, Nanak Piao and Sisganj are some of the gurdwaras that have seen high footfall over the past week. Sirsa said all possible measures were in place at these gurdwaras, including regular sanitisation of the premises and langar halls. “Those serving food have been asked to use santisers and wash their hands every minute,” he added.

On Monday, DSGMC banned entry of foreigners into gurdwaras. “Since the langar serves lakhs of people each day, we have not stopped it all together but are taking all precautions,” Sirsa added.

DSGMC has been regularly disinfecting all handrails, lifts and chairs at gurdwaras, in addition to distributing 10,000 free face masks.
