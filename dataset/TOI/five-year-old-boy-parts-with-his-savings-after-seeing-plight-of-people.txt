COIMBATORE: A five-year-old boy from Siddhapudur in the city on Monday donated all his piggy bank savings (Rs 7,000) to the collector’s relief fund as a gesture of fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. 


The boy – S Reno Joshua, had saved the amount from the gifts he had received in the past three years. He handed over the entire amount to district collector K Rajamani on Monday. 

“A couple of days ago, Reno saw the visuals of how guest workers in the city were struggling during the lockdown. He shot a series of questions towards us after seeing visuals. When we explained about the difficulties that they had been undergoing, he said that he wanted to donate his piggy bank savings,” Reno’s father Suresh said. 

“Even though we have been thinking of using the money to admit our three-and-a-half-year-old daughter in school this year, we did not want to set a bad example by stopping him from donating the money,” he said, adding that they have decided to postpone the admission of their daughter by a year. 

“We can understand the difficulties of staying away from home especially when the country is locked down completely,” he added. 

Similarly, RM Mathivanan, 64, an auto driver, donated a sum of Rs 10,000 to the collector’s relief fund on Monday. He is the president of Jaishanthi auto stand at Singanallur and a member of Labour Progressive Federation (LPF). “Even though the amount is big, I donated the money because I wanted to support the government in its fight against Covid-19,” he said.
