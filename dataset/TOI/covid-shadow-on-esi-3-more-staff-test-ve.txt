Hyderabad: Covid-19 shadow on ESI, 3 more staff test positive
2020-06-15
HYDERABAD: Three more healthcare workers have tested positive for coronavirus at ESIC Hospital, Sanathnagar.


Earlier, staff from the nephrology department were put under quarantine after a patient died whose test result later showed the person was Covid-19 positive. “Three employees of the nephrology department have tested positive. So far, seven staff members from the hospital have contracted the infection. Over 100 staff, including technicians, nurses and housekeeping staff, have been put under quarantine,” a healthcare employee revealed. 

Without confirming the number of positive cases among their staff members, a nodal officer from the hospital said over 60 staff members have been put under quarantine. “There are a couple of positive cases among the staff members in the nephrology department. The issue is patients, who visit the hospital without any symptoms of Covid-19, later test positive. These are asymptomatic patients. We are now looking into this issue,” ESIC Medical College and Hospital nodal officer and medical superintendent KK Pal said.

Speaking to TOI, a staff member, who tested positive on Saturday and who had worked in nephrology and neurology department, said in a week at least two patients had tested positive. “I had handled one of the patients for at least a week. Before the surgery, patient’s samples are sent for the test or if they start showing symptoms. By that time, the staff are already exposed to the infection,” the staffer added.

“Every day the hospital logs around 1,500 out-patients. There is hardly any social distancing at OPD. After checking temperature and symptoms of the patients, they are sent to the Covid-19 ward. If the patient is asymptomatic, we are exposed to them with no PPE,” another healthcare worker from the hospital said.
