PATHANAMTHITTA: Three students who came from Kalaburagi on Tuesday have been sent for home isolation since they have not developed any symptoms, said district collector P B Nooh.

“The isolation has been done since the first Covid-19 death in the country was reported from Kalaburagi in Karnataka. They will be shifted to hospital, if needed. A health team is specially monitoring them,” Nooh said.

The 24-year-old who arrived from Italy at Pandalam has been tested negative and is under isolation in the general hospital. 

The district collector said the administration is all set to meet any emergency and is well equipped to quarantine even a 100 hundred people at a time. “Preparations are on for being equipped for a mass evacuation, if needed. There is no need for any emergency at present but the administration is getting prepared to face it if it comes,” he said. The district collector said 2,000 people, who have come from different countries to the district after February 25, have been identified. “This number was 788 on Monday,” he said. 

A doctor from the health service has also been put under isolation. Even though he had no direct contact with any of the positive cases, he was isolated since he had fever, said district medical officer Dr A L Sheeja.tnn
