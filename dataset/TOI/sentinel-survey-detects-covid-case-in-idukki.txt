Kottayam: A sentinel surveillance conducted by the health department in Idukki district on Thursday has detected a Covid-19 case. The virus was detected in a 39-year-old bakery owner residing in Karunapuram panchayath in Nedunkandam block in the district. 

Sentinel surveillance is conducted to detect community transmission of Covid-19. The state had decided to strengthen the sentinel surveillance system, which will help in providing early warning signals and epidemiological information about the next phase of the pandemic in the state. There has been a state-wide direction regarding this in the wake of the inflow of expatriates. 

In sentinel surveillance, the state population is divided into seven groups based on potential risk exposure. The person who had contracted the virus belongs to Group III, which include persons with high social exposure. This group includes food delivery persons, community volunteers for Covid-19 control, policemen, health and media personnel and shop vendors. To detect community spread in such a group, 400 samples are tested in one week. 

In Kottayam, KSRTC will run special services for the staff of the district collectorate, which will start functioning from Friday. The service will begin from Changanassery, Parippu, Mundakkayam, Pala, Chembu and Vaikom. 

A meeting called by food minister Thilothaman decided to strengthen Covid-19 prevention measures from the grassroot level in the district in the wake of expats arriving in good numbers to the state. Meanwhile, the district prison here earned Rs 1 lakh from the sale of face masks and sanitizers made by the inmates.
