AHMEDABAD: A day after India witnessed its first Covid-19 death in Karnataka, the Gujarat high court on Friday swung into action to safeguard court premises against coronavirus spread. The HC directed government authorities to strictly follow the precautionary measures recommended in the advisory issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare to curb spread of the pandemic.

 To formalize the move the HC filed a PIL suo motu and issued directions to the government as well as bar associations and court administrators.

 
 

The bench of Gujarat Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice A J Shastri directed lawyers across the state to “discourage litigants from attending courts”. Those who appear in court as party-in-person may remain absent and the courts will not pass adverse order in their cases, the bench said.

Clarifying that its directions are to “strengthen hands of the governments”, the HC issued notice to the state government, health department and legal department asking them to file affidavits within a week stating what action they took on the HC instructions and what is the situation and how equipped the administration is to deal with the pandemic.
