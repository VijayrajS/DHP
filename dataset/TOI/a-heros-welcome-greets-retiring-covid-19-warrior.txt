2020-05-25
PUNE: It was a rousing welcome for 58-year-old Vijay Kumar Deshpande, an assistant police inspector rank officer posted with the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), as he arrived at the Sai Dwarkamai Society of Kondhwa after completing his 14-day quarantine period late on Saturday evening. 

With ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ slogans being raised and the officer being showered with flower petals, Deshpande seemed overwhelmed as he thanked everyone with folded hands. He said, “I have been declared as Covid-19 negative,” amid loud cheering. 

His son, Makrand, told TOI that his father was on Covid-19 duties for the past two months. “Since the outbreak of the virus, he has been working tirelessly. He was posted at different places in these two months including, Pimpri, Chinchwad, Chakan etc. I think he came home twice late in the evening, only to leave for work in the early morning around 5am the next day,” he said. 

Deshpande was sent to 14-day quarantine for precautionary purposes at the SRPF headquarters located in Ramtekri once his duties ended. “He didn’t have any symptoms but as he was on the frontline, he was sent in quarantine for 14 days. On Saturday, he came home and our neighbours decided to give him a rousing welcome,” Makrand said.

Besides showering flower petals, many women in the society performed ‘aarti’ and put ‘tilak’ on his forehead. 

Deshpande said that those on active Covid-19 duty needed to be respected by the general masses. “One should understand that police, doctors, nurses etc, are risking their lives while performing their duties at present. They also have families and are working under immense pressure. People need to respect them. I am thankful to all the society members who were kind enough and treated me in such a dignified way. And it is nice to be with one’s family after long,” the officer, who will be retiring from service later this year, told TOI.
