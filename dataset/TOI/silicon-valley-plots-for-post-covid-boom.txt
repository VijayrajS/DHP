KOLKATA: With the Covid-19 pandemic triggering a redistribution of the global manufacturing network, specially in the fields of electronic components, telecommunication and data centre, the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has floated an expression of interest (EoI) for allotting land at the Bengal Silicon Valley IT hub in New Town. 


As per the EoI, 22 plots spread over 63.35 acres is being offered in the fifth phase of land allotment at Bengal Silicon Valley. The largest plot is 21.75 acres. All the plots are available on a 99-year leasehold basis. Hidco officials said that they had received one serious enquiry for the setting up of a data centre at Silicon Valley. 

“The Covid-19 pandemic has already started to redistribute the global manufacturing network with technologies that assist ‘work from home’. Streaming movies and on-line gaming are going to be the new normal in the post-Covid-19 world. We are providing the best available infrastructure for the Bengal Silicon Valley to have IT and IT-enabled service offices that can help in the ‘new normal’ work environment,” said a senior Hidco official.

Hidco held a webinar that discussed the possibility of some big firms in China moving elsewhere. “India was already reaching out to over 300 industries in China, offering them to relocate to India,” said a source from the state secretariat. 

Out of the total 200 acre of land in Bengal Silicon Valley, there are about 169 acres of allotable land excluding the roads and commercial space inside the valley. Some companies who have already applied for plots in the previous phases are Reliance Jio (40 acres), CTS (25 acres), TCS (20 acres), Capgemini (7 acres), Indian Statistical Institute and others.
