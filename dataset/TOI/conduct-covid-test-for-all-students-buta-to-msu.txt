Conduct COVID test for all students: BUTA to MSU
2020-04-30
Vadodara: The Baroda University Teachers Association (BUTA) has demanded that Gujarat government extend vacation period. 

Currently, the state government has declared vacation up to May 15 which BUTA wants to be continued till June 18.

At the same time, the teachers' association has demanded that all 35,000 students who are coming for examination should submit corona test report if they wish to appear for any examination conducted by M S University in July. 

A separate schedule of examination should be prepared for Covid-19 positive students, the association has demanded.

In a representation made to MSU vice-chancellor (VC) and the top brass of state education department, BUTA has demanded that the university should provide three layer surgical masks and gloves for all students, teachers and examination staff during examination while body sanitizers should be installed in the examination premises and hand sanitizers in every room.

“While we have suggested all the steps that the university should take for conducting exams, we have also made an alternate suggestion. All undergraduate and post graduate students can be given result based on the academic performance of their previous semesters and average of all previous semesters can be declared as their current semester result and awarded the degree,” said BUTA general secretary Dr Nikul Patel.

“Any student willing to improve his or her examination result can be allowed to take exam only after the present pandemic situation of COVID19 improves. 

The university can consider the best of two exams for such students,” he said.
