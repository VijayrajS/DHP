Lockdown effect: No more effluents flow into these villages in Rajasthan
2020-05-15
JODHPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the inhabitants of Dhawa, Doli and Araba villages on Jodhpur-Barmer border, although temporarily. 


After 10 years, the villagers have got respite from the effluents and harmful chemicals coming from the textile and steel industries in Jodhpur, which had taken a toll on flora and fauna, and had destabilised agriculture and human life in these villages. 

Thanks to the lockdown, the toxic impact of the industrial waste is fading gradually, as nature and wildlife in the area comes back to life. “We have been fighting to save our villages and the agriculture here, ever since the problem surfaced 10 years back. We even took judicial recourse and the National Green Tribunal handed out various directions, but in vain,” said Narpat Singh Araba, who has been spearheading this struggle on all fronts. 

“But what the system failed to do, the pandemic has done for us. We know that it is temporary and with the lockdown lifted, when the industries would begin functioning full throttle, the situation would be the same again. But for now, we are happy and enjoying this spell,” said Araba. 

A large quantity of untreated water from about 750 tie-&-die and steel re-rolling industries of Jodhpur has been making its way directly to these villages, along the Jodhpur-Barmer highway some 25 km away, causing irreparable damage to not only the flora and fauna, but taking a toll on agriculture and human life also. 

Because of this untreated water, around 20,000 bighas of land and about a dozen natural water resources across half a dozen villages, remain inundated in this chemical effluent. The villagers have stopped using the cremation ground and sending their children to school, both of which remain inundated in the chemical-infused water most of the year.
