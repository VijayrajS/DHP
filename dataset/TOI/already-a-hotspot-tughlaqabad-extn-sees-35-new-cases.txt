NEW DELHI: At least 35 cases of novel coronavirus were reported on Sunday from Tughlaqabad Extension, which was declared a hotspot by Delhi government on Friday. Three people, one of them a grocery store owner in his 50s, had tested positive for Covid-19 from Gali number 26.

DCP (Southeast) RP Meena said, “After the first three cases were reported, swabs of 93 people from Gali numbers 26 and 27 were taken for testing for Covid-19. Out of these samples, 35 tested positive. Though we had already sealed these two lanes, the containment area was extended till between Gali numbers 24 and 28 on the directions of the district magistrate. Our staff will be deployed at these barricades so that nobody leaves or enters the area.”

Tughlaqabad has become the third-largest coronavirus hotspot in the national capital. TOI tried to contact the district magistrate for updates, but she was not available for comments.

Area councillor Poonam Bhati said the increase in the number of cases could be the result of community spread considering people were still meeting their relatives and friends.

“The grocer and his two friends, who first tested positive, usually sat together in the evening. The government tested their family members, tenants and relatives. The samples of all 11 family members of the grocery shop owner came negative, probably because his house is far from his shop. However, 35 people, including family members of the other two men, their tenants and relatives, tested positive,” said Bhati.

The councillor claimed that the infected people continued to meet despite the area being cordoned off. “All these cases were reported within 3-4 days. We have been requesting everyone to stay inside, but many are not adhering to the norms,” said Bhati, adding that the corporation had been regularly spraying disinfectants and the drive would be intensified.
