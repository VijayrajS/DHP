2020-03-21
Even as police presence was beefed up near quarantine facilities at Chinna Udaipu and Austinpatti on Friday, residents are still not comfortable having a quarantine facility located in their area.

In Austinpatti, where a large number of Sri Lankan refugees reside, the few shops on the road leading to the facility remained closed. “Health officials came and spoke to us saying we have nothing to fear. However, they didn’t even make efforts to sanitise the area or set up hand-washing facility. How are we supposed to feel safe?” said a Sri Lankan refugee who has been living in a hut in the area for more than 30 years with his family. He added that refugees like them don’t even have any alternative place to go to. 

Though they initially held protests, the refugees eventually gave up and those who could leave to close by villages left by shutting their homes and shops. “We just have to stay here and leave it all in God’s hands,” added the resident.

On the other hand, at Chinna Udaipu, where the quarantine facility also big, police gathered in numbers to prevent protests. Residents said that health officials had created awareness about Covid-19 and preventive measures in the area after the protests. The roads remained deserted as only vehicles carrying those under quarantine plied to and from the quarantine facility. 

“Health officials also brought various chemicals to sanitise the area. They said they will be first finishing the immediate area and then continue to process to surrounding areas,” said a local shopkeeper.
