KCR virus jibe: Cong India’s coronavirus
2020-03-15
CM K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday dubbed Congress “coronavirus of the country” and asked it to not politicise the virus scare. The CM, who was caught in a heated debate with CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka during a discussion in the assembly, faulted him for naming a particular area (Old City). “In Congress-led Rajasthan, there are coronavirus cases. Should we say they have failed to take preventive measures?” he wondered and asked Vikramarka to not politicise a sensitive issue. 

Congress MLA Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy took objection to KCR’s remarks. “How can you blame Congress which has granted statehood and describe it coronavirus of India.” He appealed to speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy to expunge the CM’s remarks.
