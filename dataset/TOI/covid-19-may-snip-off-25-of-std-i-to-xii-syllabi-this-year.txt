2020-06-11
PUNE: The coronavirus situation may truncate the state board’s syllabi for standards I to XII by nearly 25% this academic year.

Students will be told to either learn the chapters on their own or the portion may be omitted entirely from the syllabus. 

The Maharashtra State Council of Education, Research and Training has almost finished reducing the content, and a report is expected from each subject committee within 2-3 days, director of the council Dinkar Patil said. 

On Tuesday, HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal’s Tweet read, “In view of the current circumstances and after receiving a lot of requests from parents and teachers, we are contemplating the option of reduction in the syllabus and instructional hours for the coming academic year.” After the restructuring, a corrigendum of all the changes would be issued and put online. 

“The preliminary discussion indicates that we can cut some parts. Students will have to learn some parts by themselves, some sections which have no links in the next standard will be dropped. Some portions are repeated which can be self-learned,” Patil said.
