PUDUCHERRY: The Covid-19 scare has not subdued the hostility between chief minister V Narayanasamy and lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi as they continue to engage in establishing their authority. 


Narayanasamy on Wednesday told reporters that he had directed the chief secretary and all secretaries to honour the Madras high court bench's order, which according to him, declared that the lieutenant governor can only act as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers and cannot outrightly reject any proposal or direct the authorities to act otherwise. 

He said he told them that the LG can call for clarifications on the proposals from them and they can submit information to her only through him. Bedi reacted sharply to Narayanasamy's move stating that the high court dismissed the single judge order, which the chief minister used to threaten the officials with contempt of court proceedings. She said the appeal filed against the single judge order by her and the Centre was allowed by the high court bench. The bench's order reiterated that Puducherry was governed by the Union Territory Act, the Business Rules and the Financial Rules. 

"The same laws and rules have been tested in two preceding judgments of Honble Madras High Court which came a few weeks back, such as in the selection of the election commissioner and the decision of direct transfer money for free rice for BPL and APL being upheld. Hon CM has actually lost in all last three Court cases decided by Honble Madras High, which he did not share with the public. I am compelled to put the record straight. After securing all three judgments in favour of government of India and the Lt Governor I thought the HCM would have accepted that the Puducherry is not a State. And that it is governed by the Union Territory Act and the Business and financial rules which existed from the very beginning, much before I came," she said.
