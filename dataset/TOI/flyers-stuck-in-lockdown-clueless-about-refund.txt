Flyers stuck in lockdown clueless about refund
2020-04-24
Aurangabad: Air passengers, whose tickets for March-end and April were cancelled after domestic and international flight operations were halted, are now seeking refund from air carriers, but are facing a difficult time.

Nita Indani, a resident of the city, had travelled to Mumbai from Aurangabad in the first week of March. On March 6, she had booked a return ticket to Aurangabad on March 29. However, as the nationwide lockdown was imposed from March 25, the flight was cancelled. “I recieved a message stating that the flight has been cancelled. However, there has been no communication about the refund,” she said. 

The circular from the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) with instructions on refund to air carriers may not provide any relief to the flyers. The circular instructed the airlines to refund the amount paid for tickets booked during the lockdown period. This leaves thousands of flyers like Indani in loss of their ticket amount with no fault of theirs because their ticket was booked before the lockdown period. 

In addition, the airlines are not even offering full refund to the flyers who had booked their tickets during the lockdown period as instructed by the MoCA. Aviation expert Ahmed Jaleel said, “Instead of refunding the money of passengers, the airlines are telling them that they can use that amount to book tickets in future. However, not all passengers are frequent flyers. So, the offer by airlines is meaningless for them,” Jaleel said. 

He added that despite of the instructions of the MoCA against starting the sale of tickets after lockdown period, many airline operators are leaving their ticket booking window open which will put people into further inconvenience if the lockdown extends.
