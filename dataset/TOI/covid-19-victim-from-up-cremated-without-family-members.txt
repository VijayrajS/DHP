Nagpur: Being a cleaner on a transport truck hardly allowed Pritam Kumar (name changed) to stay with his family in Uttar Pradesh. Even in death, Covid-19 did not allow his family to bid final farewell to him. He died of Covid-19 on May 2 and his last rites were conducted by team of health department in Washim, in presence of a distant relative from Indore on May 5. 

45-yr-old Kumar was on a transport truck from Mumbai to Nagpur when the truck had a flat tyre near Washim. While waiting for repair at a petrol pump, Kumar started feeling breathless. He was moved to Washim Government hospital where his condition deteriorated and he died on May 2. His family members staying in a village of northern UP were informed of the death. 

“The deceased hails from a poor family. It is not that they were not willing to come for last rites, but it was not possible for them logistically. Even transporting a Covid-19 deceased body to UP was risky. So, we decided to conduct last rites here in Washim,” said district collector Hrishikesh Modak. A cousin who used to work at Indore was able to make it to the funeral. 

“His cremation was conducted as per the guidelines of ICMR. Otherwise also, we don’t allow family-members to conduct the last rites. Only health officials with PPE kits conduct the cremation,” said Modak. Health department team not only followed the ICMR rules but also conducted funeral as per religious beliefs of deceased’s family. Even if they were not present, some customs as per their traditions were followed.

Washim has had only two cases of Covid-19. One patient has recovered while other is the deceased person. The district is in green zone as no new case has been reported here in 20 days.
