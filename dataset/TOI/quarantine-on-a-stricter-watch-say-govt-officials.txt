Pune: State health officials and the police will clamp down upon home quarantine violations and monitor those seeking permissions for travel during the lockdown. 

A senior government official told TOI that each district now has a plan to keep vigil after the Wadhawan family travelled from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar during lockdown.

“District collectors and police officials will put in place the monitoring system. Essential services and a medical emergency cases get permission from the authorities to travel,” the official said. A cellphone application monitors those under home quarantine. 

District administration officials said there are nearly 11, 245 persons under home quarantine who are monitored through Maharashtra Home Quarantine Tracking System, a selfie-based face recognition and geo-location tracking application. 

The AI engine analyses the uploaded information to record the quarantine attendance. If the user fails to upload a genuine picture or if they are away from their registered geo-location an is triggered on the dashboard for authorised personnel to take action for non-compliance of home quarantine guidelines. 

Police officers keep track and each individual is told put out his or her selfie at least 5-6 times a day to ensure that they are at home.

The same process is followed with 284 persons under institutional quarantine in the district.

Technical consultant to the state government Subhash Salunkhe told TOI that district authorities have to keep strict watch on those under quarantine and their movement. 

“Additional police force have to be deployed to prevent movement. These are strict orders and they have to be followed,” he told TOI.
