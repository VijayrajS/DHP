Ramp up screening, testing of all: Kamat
2020-04-20
Panaji: With no new reported coronavirus cases in Goa, the state is safe, but not yet free from the threat of the pandemic, opposition leader Digambar Kamat said. He said that only after widespread testing of Goans was completed would people be able to relax.

“As Goa turns into a Covid-19-free zone, we are now safe, but not free from the virus. Only testing can take us from safety to complete freedom. More preventive action should be the only way of celebration,” Kamat said. 

With all reported Covid-19 cases having recovered, Kamat said the state government must now shift focus to screening and testing. “The government needs to accelerate screening and testing. Steps must also be taken to address other core issues such as economic revival and financial stability of the state,” he said. 

Thanking the medical team of Goa Medical College and Hospital, as well as frontline staff for their hard work and dedication in combating Covid-19, Kamat said, “Salute to all of them for risking their lives to protect others. I also compliment the people of Goa who have shown restraint and maintained peace and discipline throughout the lockdown period, and appeal to all to continue with the same,” he said.
