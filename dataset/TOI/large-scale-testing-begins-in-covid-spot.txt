LUCKNOW: A day after five persons were diagnosed with Covid-19 at Nazarbagh vegetable market in Kaiserbagh, health department on Monday launched a massive containment and testing drive in the locality, which is threatening to become the second big hotspot in the city after Sadar.

Swab samples of about 300 people, including 25 children and nearly 130 women, were taken and sent for testing. Total 15 people have so far tested positive from the locality, which was declared a hotspot on May 5. The highest number of 105 cases in the city have been reported from five localities declared hotspots in Sadar area. The infection was detected in Nazarbagh after a shopkeeper and two vegetable vendors were found positive earlier this month. They had come in contact with a vegetable vendor in Lalbagh who tested positive on April 28.

In charge of district infectious disease control unit Dr KP Tripathi said, “Like Sadar, Nazarbagh is densely populated and people live in clusters. Therefore, we decided to declare it a hotspot and collect swab samples of every person who had come in contact with the patients.”

Meanwhile, a 69-year-old man from Sadar tested positive for novel coronavirus infection on Monday, taking the city’s tally to 253. The patient had come to KGMU’s fever clinic with breathing difficulty and flu-like symptoms on Sunday.

“Nine members of his family are also being tested,” chief medical officer Dr Narendra Agarwal said.

Meanwhile, six patients were discharged on Monday.
