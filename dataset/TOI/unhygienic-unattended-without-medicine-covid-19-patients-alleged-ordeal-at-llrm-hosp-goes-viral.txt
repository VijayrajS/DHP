MEERUT: An audio clip from a telephonic conversation between a local businessman and his relative, who had tested positive for Covid-19 and is currently under isolation in Meerut’s Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College, has gone viral on social media.

In the audio clip, the Covid-19 patient can purported be heard narrating his ordeal. He complained of unhygienic conditions in the isolation ward. According to him, the patients in the ward were allegedly left unattended without any proper medical attention.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Raj Kumar said, “An investigation has been set up in the matter. If any negligence is found, a report will be submitted accordingly.”

The businessman confirmed having spoken to his relative over the phone on Saturday morning. 

"The arrangements are abysmal. There is no doctor who can attend to patients here. I have complained of breathlessness but I am yet to get any medical treatment or aid,” the patient could purportedly be heard saying in the viral voice clip.

Several videos of unhygienic conditions and poor arrangement at the isolation ward have also surfaced on social media. The local administration is yet to make a statement. 

"The timings of meals are irregular. Yesterday, we received breakfast around 11am. People who have to take medicine are facing inconvenience as meals arrive at odd hours,” the patient allegedly said. 

Meanwhile, distressed relatives and family members of the patient took to social media to raise their voices against the alleged unhygienic condition and mismanagement at the medical college. 

"My brother was admitted in the LLRM Medical College on May 7. Till now, no tests have been conducted for the rest of the family. His condition is deteriorating. No doctors are visiting the patients. They are being left to die alone,” a cousin of the patient said in a tweet.
