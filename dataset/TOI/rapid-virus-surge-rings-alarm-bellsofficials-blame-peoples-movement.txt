HYDERABAD: Even as ICMR is gearing up to conduct random Covid-19 tests in Greater Hyderabad limits, the rapid spread of coronavirus in the last few days is a major concern for offcials. 

Till a few days ago, positive cases were being reported mostly from LB Nagar, Charminar, Malakpet and Jiyaguda. But now, Covid-19 positive cases are getting reported from several other areas of the city, ringing alarm bells for the health officials.





New cases are now reported from Vanasthalipuram, Khairatabad, Kondapur, Serilingampally, Qutbullapur, Miyapur, Madhapur, Chintal, Shapurnagar and Alwal areas. In these areas, Covid-19 cases hardly made a noise during the lockdown. Soon after the relaxation of lockdown norms, the sharp spike in cases from these areas is worrying the officials.
Officials said with people from non-hotspot areas moving to areas like Jiyaguda and LB Nagar, there has been an upward trend in the positive cases. “Jiyaguda has a vegetable market and a lot of mutton shops. Many people from other areas go there to buy essential items. This could be one of the reasons why we are witnessing a spread of virus to other areas,” a GHMC official said.

The spread of virus had come down in Malakpet, Charminar, Nallakunta and other areas. But, within a week after the lifting the containment zones, there was a spurt in the positive cases.
As officials took up contract tracing, focus is on the movement of people in the last 10 days. To keep a tab on the spread of the decease, officials are also planning to conduct more number of test. 

Officials said, “For those who are in quarantine, we are planning to do tests after one week to check whether the Covid-like symptoms are severe or not.” 

“Testing those who are having symptoms only once may not be enough. So, it is better to test them after seven days of quarantine,” explained another official.
