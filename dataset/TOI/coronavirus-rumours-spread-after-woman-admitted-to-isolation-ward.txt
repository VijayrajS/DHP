Bareilly: A 55-year-old woman was admitted to an isolation ward at a private hospital in Bareilly city on Saturday night after she complained of fever and blood pressure on returning from Dubai. However, doctors treating her found that she is a heart patient. No symptoms of novel coronavirus were not found in the woman.

A clarification regarding the woman’s condition was issued by the health department as her picture in the isolation ward was circulated on social media on Monday and it was claimed that she is a suspected case of novel coronavirus (nCov-2019).

Meanwhile, the woman’s family has shifted her to Lucknow for treatment. 

The woman returned from Dubai on January 27 and was admitted to a city-based private hospital on Saturday night. Dr Somesh Mehrotra, director of the hospital where the woman was admitted, said, “When the patient was in Dubai, she had fever. As a precautionary measure, we kept her in the isolation ward. However, when we examined her, we found that she had high blood pressure and heart failure. She had no symptoms related to coronavirus. We had informed the health department. Someone clicked a picture of the isolation ward and circulated it on WhatsApp, stating that the patient is a suspected case of nCoV, which is wrong.” 

Additional chief medical officer Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “The doctor treating the woman told us that she is a heart patient. No suspected case of novel coronavirus has been reported in Bareilly and only rumours were being spread.” 

Chief medical officer Dr Vineet Shukla said, “Cases of Influenza and swine flu are being reported in the region. Only those patients who have travelled to China in the past one month are suspected of novel coronavirus infection.”
