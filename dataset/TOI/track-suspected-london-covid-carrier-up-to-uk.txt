Track suspected London Covid-19 carrier: UP to UK
2020-03-27
LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has written to the department of health and social care in the United Kingdom about the urgency to track and trace a London-based businessman who recently visited India and is being linked to at least five coronavirus positive cases in Noida. 


On Tuesday, a 47-year-old woman in Noida’s sector 137 with no travel history tested positive for Covid-19. To contain any possible spread of infection, the Gautam Buddha Nagar administration sealed the entire building where she lived for two days besides putting her husband and daughter into isolation. On Wednesday, the woman’s husband tested positive to the infection whereas on Thursday, her daughter and two others were added to the list. 

The fact that the woman had no travel history had left health authorities in panic. However, the family had hosted two guests from London around Holi. 

“So far, all Covid cases in India have travel history, which is being cited as one of the important reasons for fewer cases and deaths in the country compared to the rest of the world. A positive case without travel history could mean that the pandemic virus has spread to the population, which can be an impending disastrous scenario as in the case of China or Italy,” explained a senior health officer. 

“The possibility is that visitors from London could have been asymptomatic carriers of the infection and left behind the virus which the family members contracted. However, this can be cleared only if the visitors from London test positive,” an official added. 

State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal said: “We have provided the contact details of the guests to health authorities in London. We are hoping for a quick response as an asymptomatic carrier is equally risky for their country.”
