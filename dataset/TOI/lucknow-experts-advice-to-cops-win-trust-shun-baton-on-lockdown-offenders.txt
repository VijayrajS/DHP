Experts' advice to cops: Win trust, shun baton on lockdown offenders in Lucknow
2020-03-26
LUCKNOW: Legal experts on Wednesday described 'shaming' and 'public humiliation' of those caught violating lockdown by police as against the spirit of law. They suggested that at a time when India is facing coronavirus challenge, the attempt of police should be to gain people's confidence rather than resorting to measures which may cause psychological disorder. 


Six persons, who were caught violating prohibitory orders in Aliganj and Indiranagar on Tuesday and Wednesday, were booked under Section 188 of CrPC for disobeying government orders. Thereafter, they were also made to pose for photograph with posters in hand stating "Main samaj ka dushman hun, main ghar par nahi rahunga" (I am enemy of the society. I won't stay at home). Supreme Court lawyer and former additional solicitor-general Ashok Nigam said the criminal procedure code of India has no provision of shaming people publicly in such a manner and the law states that police have to strictly go by the CrPC. Any step by police which is not covered by CrPC is illegal. 

Senior high court lawyer IB Singh said there is no law by which police can do such an act. "This act is similar to one when the district administration had put up posters of those served with recovery orders following the violent anti-CAA protests," said Singh. 

People, too, have described the police action as unnecessary and discriminatory. "I saw so many people in luxury cars who were politely told by police to return to their homes whereas people in the photographs appear to be commoners," Ayushman Singh, a teacher, added.
