BHOPAL: The impact of limited relaxation in lockdown along with the opening of some offices and businesses would be felt in about a week to a fortnight, according to experts. 


As a trend, infection has been reported in some areas. Services such as some trading activity was permitted in Mangalwara, Budhwara and Jumerati — the wholesale retail market in the state capital. 

On the other side are areas like Aheer Mohalla in Jehangirabad. People residing there are involved in milk supply. There was a lot of movement in these localities that led to the spread of Covid-19. This is where the spurt in infections was the strongest in Bhopal. Similar spurts need to be avoided. 

One way to do this early detection and sticking to social distancing, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) associate professor and Covid-19 testing and response team led by Dr Parag Sharma.

Around 1,200 people are in quarantine in Bhopal. “In about seven days, we can realise the trend. It would also depend on new cases of infection related to upper respiratory tract or URI. To contain the spread, the most important thing is early medical intervention. If a person starts sneezing along with sore throat, immediate medical attention is crucial to control the spread,” said Dr Sharma, a senior pulmonologist at Hamidia hospital.

“The virus will not go away. To contain it, people need to adhere to guidelines pertaining to quarantine and social distancing,” said Dr Sharma.
