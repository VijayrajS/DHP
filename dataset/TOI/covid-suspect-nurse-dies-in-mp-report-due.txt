Covid-suspect nurse dies in MP, report due
2020-04-23
INDORE: A covid-19 suspect, who worked as a nurse at Indore’s MGM Medical College, died during treatment late Tuesday night, leaving the medical fraternity shaken. Her corona report is yet to come in.

What added to the shock was that another nurse of the same hospital died around the same time. She was a heart patient.

MGM is the state’s biggest government-run hospital and at the forefront of the fight against coronavirus. The two deaths came as a shock to colleagues.

The Covid-19 suspect was admitted to the chest ward of MY Hospital after she developed the symptoms, said MY Hospital’s superintendent Dr PS Thakur. “She had served in the hospital till April 5 before being home-isolated. Her test report is awaited,” Thakur added.

The other nurse had heart disease and was ailing for a long time. “She didn’t show any symptom of Covid-19, so her sample wasn’t taken,” Thakur said. The hospital management and staff have expressed their condolences.

Indore –MP’s covid hotspot – is the only city in the country where two doctors (private practitioners) have died of coronavirus. At least five nurses of MY Hospital have been found Covid-positive in the past month. They were working in SICU, gynaecology ward and other important sections of the hospital. One of them has been discharged after fighting off the infection.

A lab technician and a lab attendant of MY Hospital’s blood bank have also tested positive. The administration has quarantined many employees since they were primary contacts of these patients.
