TRICHY: LPG cylinder deliverymen in Trichy have appealed to the district administration to consider them as frontline workers as they deliver to various households, including those in containment zones, and test them for Covid-19. 

A total of 670 people, inclduing 400 in the city deliver LPG cylinders across the district. Though they are provided face masks and sanitizers, the deliverymen say they are vulnerable to contract Covid-19 as they cover at least 50 houses a day. 

“If one of the deliverymen is infected, authorities will have to quarantine hundreds of houses. There are more than one lakh deliverymen and fieldworkers involved in cylinder distribution in the state,” state president of Tamil Nadu LPG Cylinder Deliverymen Employees Union (TNLCDEU), R Ganesh said. “Testing the deliverymen will help them serve the people without fear,” K A Subramanyam, an LPG cylinder distributor from Cantonment said. 

However, corporation officials said that mass testing for LPG deliverymen will force them to test online food aggregators.
