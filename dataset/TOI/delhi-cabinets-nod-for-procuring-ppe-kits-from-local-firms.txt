NEW DELHI: The Delhi cabinet has given the nod for procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits by city hospitals from local manufacturers and suppliers at market rate not exceeding Rs 1,087.47, amid an increasing demand amid the coronavirus spread.


Speaking to IANS, a Delhi Health Department officials said on Sunday that the decision was taken as the city hospitals were facing severe shortage of kits.

"In view of the growing number of Covid-19 cases and the shortage of PPE kits, it is directed to take immediate action to procure adequate numbers of PPE kits as per the approval of the cabinet," the order signed by Padmini Singla, secretary (Health and Family Welfare) said.

"The cabinet approved that the procurement of PPE kits may be made by the individual hospitals or CPA from local manufacturers and suppliers at market rate, provided the rates are less than or comparable to rates of the HLL," the health official said.

The HLL Lifecare Limited has quoted Rs 1087.47 per kit, the official added.

The Central Procurement Agency (CPA) is the nodal agency for procurement of all items required by health facilities under the Delhi government.

In Delhi, the total cases were 445 on Sunday morning, with six deaths so far.

Meanwhile, the Delhi government has demanded the kits from the Centre. "However, we have not received any kits from the Centre so far," the official said.

The official said with the limited stock left with the hospitals, the Department has now allowed the hospitals for procuring the kits.

"We cannot let our medical staff work without protective kits," the official said.

Around 10 healthcare staff, including doctors, have tested coronavirus positive in Delhi, with the number reaching over 50 across the country.
