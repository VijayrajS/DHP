Shortage of N95 masks in Agra
2020-02-12
AGRA: As the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus as a global emergency, shortage of N95 masks, effective in preventing the virus, is now being reported in the local markets due to high demand and no supply from the manufacturers. Black-marketing has resulted in increase in price of the masks. 

According to the chemists, the demand of N95 masks has increased in the past 15 days. Besides local residents, tourists visiting the Taj Mahal and other monuments are demanding these masks. 

A tour guide said, “Local medical shops which fall in the Taj Ganj area are taking advantage of the situation and are selling the original mask at an increased rate. The mask which costs Rs 300, is now being sold for Rs 500. Besides, they are also trying to sell the substandard quality masks with the name of N95.” 

President of the Agra chemist association Ashu Sharma said, “The outbreak of coronavirus in the neighbouring countries has scared the people. This has led to the demand of N95 masks which has increased significantly. There is shortage of N95 masks in the market. Manufacturers are focusing on exporting the masks to China and neglecting domestic supply.”

Head of TB and chest diseases department at SN Medical College Dr Santosh Kumar said, “N95 mask is very helpful in protection from bacteria and virus. It is helpful in protection from the Novel Coronavirus. However, other surgical masks are not helpful in preventing transmission of the virus.”

When contacted chief medical officer (CMO) Agra Dr Mukesh Kumar Vatsa said, “We have N95 masks for the staff in the hospitals. However, for the attendants and others we have three- layered masks which can also be used. So far, no case of coronavirus has surfaced in Agra. We are checking suspected cases on a daily basis.”
