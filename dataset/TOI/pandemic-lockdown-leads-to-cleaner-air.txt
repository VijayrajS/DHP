2020-03-31
Aurangabad: Due to a country-wide lockdown from past one week, there has been a considerable drop in the air pollution levels of the city.

Over the last one-week vehicle movement is next to negligible which saw the environmental sensors installed under the smart city project showing a drop in numbers. 

Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (ASCDCL), the special purpose vehicle formed for the implementation of the Smart City project in Aurangabad, has hired KEC International Ltd. for the master system integrator (MSI) project. 

The dashboard available with the MSI showed a notable change at Kranti Chowk and Mahanubhav Ashram Chowk. The data recorded from March 20 to 28 showed between 111 to 29 with the average being 75 which is well within the limits of CPCB standards.
