Citing lockdown, shallot farmers delay summer cultivation
2020-05-16
TRICHY: Poor cash reserve and challenges like mobilising farmhands and hike in fertiliser prices have forced a majority of shallot farmers in Perambalur district delay summer cultivation. 

Perambalur, which is the largest shallots producing district in Tamil Nadu, cultivates the produce on 7,000 hectares per year covering Alathur, Veppanthattai and Perambalur blocks.

Farmers involve in large-scale cultivation namely summer (May to July) and samba (October to December). Shallots cultivated and harvested in July every year will be used as seeds for the samba cultivation. But with the ongoing lockdown, farmers are hesitant to commence cultivation. 

“Farmers do not have adequate cash in their hands. Labourers are unable to reach many places in the absence of public transport. Such factors are unfavourable for summer cultivation,” Mahendra M Manivaasan, managing director, WEFSA farmers producers company said. 

In addition, constraints in logistics and transport, poor groundwater table in places like Settikulam have forced farmers to forego cultivation. With 1,008 farmers in the company, 50% of them have planned to skip the cultivation.

“Agriculture workers are still petrified about Covid-19 spread. Such adverse situation will impact the ensuing cultivation cycles since there is a possibility of a shortage of small onion seeds,” A Venkatesan, a farmer from K Pudur said.

Farmers said they spend around Rs 40,000 to cultivate shallots in one acre.

“Only a limited number of farmers have cultivated shallot crop so far. We expect the acreage to go up in the coming days. Few spells of rainfall may increase the cultivation acreage,” an horticulture department official said.
