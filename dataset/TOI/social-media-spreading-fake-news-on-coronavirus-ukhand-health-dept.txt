Dehradun: Taking cognisance of several social media posts claiming a suspected coronavirus case in Dehradun, chief medical officer (CMO) of Dehradun Dr Meenakshi Joshi held a press conference on Wednesday urging residents to not spread or believe fake news.

The CMO stressed that no coronavirus case has yet been found in the city. “A state resident was screened at a city-based hospital for coronavirus after he returned home from China but no symptoms of the virus were found. He has been kept under observation,” said the CMO, adding that fake news on such a sensitive issue can trigger panic among people. The official added that health department teams were sent to several hospitals to inspect any such case but no coronavirus patient was found.

The official added that the symptoms of the deadly virus include respiratory issues, fever and cough. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

Dr Amita Upreti, director general health, also conducted a meeting with CMOs in all 13 districts of Uttarakhand in the day to inquire about preparations of the hospitals against any possible coronavirus case in future. “We have asked the CMOs of each district to create awareness regarding the virus through press conferences and by organising awareness camps in schools, public places and offices. Precaution is the only cure of this disease,” said Dr Upreti.

According to sources from the health department, over 300 people have been screened for the disease at several hospitals in Champawat (Khatima, Banbasa and Tanakpur) and around 70 people have been screend in hospitals at Dharchula and Pithoragarh, which border Nepal.
