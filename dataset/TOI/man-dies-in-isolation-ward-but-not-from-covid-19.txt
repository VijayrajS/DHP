PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that a 38-year-old man who died in the isolation ward at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, didn’t die of Covid-19.


“He died from other complications and not from Covid-19,” Sawant said. “The cause of his death has been given as diabetes mellitus with bilateral pneumonia with adult respiratory distress syndrome with respiratory failure.” 

Sawant further said that in four tests — three conducted at GMC and one at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune — the man tested negative for Covid-19. The deceased, who returned from the US on March 22, was admitted to GMC on March 28 and treated as a Covid-19 suspect after he complained of a fever and sore throat. However, he was discharged after he tested negative for coronavirus.

He returned to GMC on April 3, and was again tested. To remove all doubts, his swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, but again, he tested negative. 

Meanwhile, Sawant said that an expert from NIV has been called to Goa and will train a second team to conduct Covid-19 tests at GMC. He added that 47 samples that were tested on Wednesday are all negative. 

The directorate of health services, in its bulletin, stated that reports of 11 suspects are awaited as of Wednesday — a day that saw as many as 47 persons put in home quarantine.
