Do not flout lockdown rules on Shab-e-Barat: Aligarh cleric
2020-04-08
AGRA: Aligarh shahar mufti on Tuesday appealed to all Muslims not to visit mosques or graveyards on Shab-e-Barat which is on April 8. He has asked them to follow the lockdown rules to stay safe. 

Talking with mediapersons, mufti Mohammad Khalid Hameed said that usually people offer namaz and visit graveyards on Shab-e-Baraat but this year, it should be avoided at all costs in view of the risk of getting infected by the Covid-19 virus. 

The mufti appealed to the Muslims to offer namaz at home and refrain from bursting fire crackers as this could be counter-productive.

Hameed further said that all Muslims could recite ‘duas’ at home for the well-being of the country as the nation fights the Covid-19 pandemic. 

“We should pray that this health crisis is over soon and every citizen of the country is safe and healthy,” Hameed said.

The eve of Shab-e-Barat that falls on the 14th day of the Islamic month of Shabban is a night of forgiveness wherein devotees seek God’s forgiveness for their sins. On that night, a large number of Muslims visit graves of their family members and recite prayers and read the Quran for forgiveness of their sins and for their well-being.
