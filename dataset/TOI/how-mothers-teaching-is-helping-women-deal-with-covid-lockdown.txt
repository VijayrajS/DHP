How ‘mother’s teaching’ is helping women deal with Covid lockdown
2020-05-10
Dehradun: The Uttaranchal Mahila Association had organised an online essay competition for women in times of the Covid-19 lockdown recently on the theme of ‘Lessons from your mother which came handy during the lockdown’. 

The response revealed some interesting experiences shared by women, including how they are tackling increased load of household chores by remembering the lesson of patience taught by their mothers. The other experiences shared by women include how sewing and stitching taught by their mothers helped them make face masks for their family members using cotton cloth, when the market price of masks had soared up to several hundred rupees.

Talking to TOI, Sadhna Sharma, president of Uttaranchal Mahila Association, said, “Since the lockdown was announced, a lot of women associated with us shared about their increased workload at home and how their mothers' advice given at some point in life is helping them cope with different situations now."

Kalpana Sharma from Dehradun who received the first prize said, “We get so engrossed in our daily duties looking after the family that we hardly get to do something of our choice. Since the lockdown was announced and wearing mask had become compulsory, I used my skills taught by my mother to stitch masks at home. Writing about the experience was very special as it reminded me of the time I spent with my mother."

Another winner of the competition, Sonia Srivastava said, “My mother was very particular about washing our hands before entering the house. The outbreak of coronavirus has re-emphasised the habit taught by my mother long back. I am ensuring the same for my family."

“It was really tough to choose the winners as each entry carried an important message in itself. Women have tried to make most of the competition by writing about their real life experiences," Sadhna Sharma added.
