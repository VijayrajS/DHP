If the fair is called off, it would be for the first time in thousands of years when the Ram Navami Mela won’t be held in Ayodhya.

Sources in district administration said the officials responsible for organising the fair are jittery as it will be very difficult to screen lakhs of devotees. Pilgrims, government officials and police deployed on duty, everyone will be at risk, they said.

Talking to reporters, Ayodhya chief medical officer Ghanshyam Singh, said, “Since it has been advised by the chief minister to avoid all gatherings, we are talking to the administrative brass on the threat and risk in holding the Ram Navami Mela this year.”

“We will not able to provide masks to all devotees to prevent the virus infection from spreading. Under these circumstances, we should not allow the huge gathering we witness every year. As a precaution, it is not advisable to organize the Mela this year. I have talked to the district magistrate and asked him to discuss the situation with the government,” he added.

Meanwhile, Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said, “Ram Navami will be celebrated as per traditions and with required care and precautions. Administration will issue timely advisory for people and will take all necessary care for health of devotees.”
