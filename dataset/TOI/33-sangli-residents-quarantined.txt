Kolhapur: The Sangli district administration has put as many as 33 Sangli residents, who returned from Varanasi via roadways on Thursday, under institutional quarantine. Their throat swab samples have been collected and sent for testing, the reports of which are awaited.

When contacted, district collector of Sangli Abhijeet Chaudhary told TOI, “We received information about a bus carrying travellers at one of our checkpoints. From there it was diverted to one of our institutional quarantine facilities in Miraj. We have collected throat swab samples of these travellers on Thursday and the results are likely to arrive by Friday evening or Saturday morning.”

Chaudhary said that the travellers are accompanied by a police personnel carrying district collectorate authorization letter to allow travel of these tourists.

“We are verifying the authenticity of the letter, but as of now it does seem genuine,” he said, adding that all the travellers are from a village in Sangli district and were stranded in Varanasi due to the nation-wide lockdown.

When asked about the age and health of the travellers, Chaudhary said that he is unaware of the details, however, nothing serious has been reported so far.
