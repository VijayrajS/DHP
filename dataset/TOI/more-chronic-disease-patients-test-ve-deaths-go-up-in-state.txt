2020-06-06
CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu reported more than 1,000 fresh Covid-19 positive cases for the sixth day in a row taking the total to 28,694. Twelve deaths, including two patients with chronic kidney disease, in 24 hours pushed the toll to 232. Chennai accounted for 1,116 of the 1,438 fresh cases on Friday.

While the infection rate is growing and doubling period the time it takes for the cases to double is dropping, what is worrying doctors is that a large number of patients are now from the older age groups, and hence more vulnerable.

“They have comorbidities including organ failure and dysfunction that pull down treatment outcomes and push up complications,” said Apollo Hospitals infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian, who is a part of the state’s medical expert committee.

On Friday, eight of the 12 people who died were senior citizens , four in their 80s. The oldest was an 86-year-old woman from Chengalpet. Nine of the 43 deaths recorded so far this month were patients with renal failure. “Many people visiting dialysis rooms are now testing positive,” said a senior nephrologist.

 On Friday, a 50-year-old woman with chronic renal failure admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital at 3.17am died at 3.55am. The doubling period decreases when the infection increases. In the last six days, the state added 7,510 cases. Analysis by senior epidemiologists at the National Institute of Epidemiology, an ICMR institute in Chennai, shows the seven-day average doubling period, which was 16.

19 days on May 30, dropped to 15.90, when Tamil Nadu recorded its first four-digit hike in daily cases on May 31. The period dropped to 13.97 days on Friday. Chennai, which added more than 3,000 cases in the last three days, now has a doubling period of 12 days, against 16 days on May 31.

The state tested 14,968 people on Friday, compared to 15,991 on Thursday, when it logged 1,384 cases. Yet, the state had 54 more cases on Friday. 

The state, which is actively a part of the plasma therapy and solidarity trial, will partner with the ICMR for the BCG vaccine trial that aims to protect the vulnerable, health minister C Vijayabaskar said.

Of the 1,438 fresh cases, 1,405 were indigenous cases and 33 were categorised “imported” as returnees from other countries and states continued to test positive. The 33 included 12 international passengers – five from Dubai and six from Qatar. One passenge from Sri Lanka, who came by sea, tested positive. Fourteen passengers from Delhi and four from Maharashtra also tested positive.

At the end of the day, 861 walked out of the hospital, taking the number of those cured in the state to 15,762, which is a recovery rate of 55%.

The health condition of 61-year-old DMK MLA J Anbazhagan, who was tested positive for Covid-19, continues to remain critical, according to doctors at the Dr Rela’s Institute and Medical Centre.
