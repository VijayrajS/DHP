Special ward for Covid positive doctors at NIMS
2020-06-08
HYDERABAD: A separate ward with around 200 beds is being prepared at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) to admit healthcare workers who have tested positive for Covid-19.

As on Sunday, around 70 doctors and medical staffers from key government hospitals had tested positive. Although most of them have been quarantined at their respective houses, the facility is aimed towards providing emergency treatment to them, if need be. 

“Few doctors have been shifted to the facility already. Right now, most of the staffers are at their respective homes but we are hoping to shift all of those who have moderate to serious symptoms here. As many as 150 ventilators have also been kept ready for the healthcare workers who contact the virus,” said a senior official from the state health department. 

Meanwhile, after 15 staffers tested positive for Covid-19 at NIMS, the authorities shut down the outpatient and inpatient blocks at five department of the hospital for sanitization. These include department of medical gastroenterology, surgical gastroenterology, urology, cardiology and surgical oncology. Among these, the most number of Covid-19 positive doctors are from the Cardiology department. 

Most of the healthcare workers have said that they are interested in staying at a dedicated facility instead of their homes as they fear spreading the virus to their family.

While there were talks about housing VIPs in the special facility too, authorities have decided against it, citing complications in defining who a VIP is. “We want to stay away from the issue. How do we decide who is a VIP? So we will stick to keeping the facility for healthcare workers,” an official said.
