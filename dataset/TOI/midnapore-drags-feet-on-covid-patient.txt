Daspur: It has taken the West Midnapore administration four days to get its act together and begin contact tracing of a 30-year-old man from the district who has tested positive for Covid-19.

The man, who works at a jewellery store in Mumbai, returned home to Nizampur in Daspur by train on March 22 and was advised to follow quarantine protocol. On Ma-rch 28, health workers found he had fever. He was taken to a primary health centre, which referred him to Ghatal Superspecialty Hospital.

The man was soon shifted to Midnapore MCH and tested on March 29. After the report came positive, the hospital sent a sample to NICED, Kolkata, that day. The report that came on Monday night was also positive.

The patient was shifted to Beliaghata ID Hospital on Tuesday, jolting the administration out of slumber. CMOH Girish Chandra Bera said there was standing instruction on home quarantine for anybody coming to the district . “We have asked the railways to provide us details of co-passengers who travelled with him between Mumbai and Kharagpur,” Bera added.
