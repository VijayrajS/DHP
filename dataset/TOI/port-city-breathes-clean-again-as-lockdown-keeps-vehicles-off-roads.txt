Port Vizag breathes clean again as lockdown keeps vehicles off roads
2020-04-11
VISAKHAPATNAM: With vehicular traffic minimal due to the statewide lockdown, air pollution in the port city has come down drastically.


There has been a sharp decline in activities at the Visakhapatnam Port Trust, fishing is banned at the harbour and production in many factories in the city and outskirts temporarily suspended. And there are no tourists.“The lockdown has improved the city’s environment”, said Sohan Hatangadi, a city-based environmentalist.

Since the port’s operations are scaled down, there is less coal dust debris in Allipuram, Dabagardens and Maharanipeta.

“Because of southeast wind, coal dust from the port areas come to these areas and it was a tough task for local residents to keep their homes and vehicles clean. But, since the lockdown, coal dust accumulation have reduced,” said Vivek Rathod, a resident of Dabagardens.

“I used to suffer from itching eyes and nose blockage due to coal dust. It has reduced. The air is cleaner and respiratory ailments have come down,” said Hatangadi.

“With ban on fishing for nearly three months, that too during the time of breeding, fish population of Bay of Bengal would increase,” said Arijili Dasu, a fishermen activist.

Many said the city has a throwback in to the 60s and 70s during the current lockdown.

“I am a regular morning walker. Now I go to the market on alternate days at the early hours. The air is clean and sky is clear. It makes me feel I am living in the Vizag of the 70s,” said K Raju, who retired as a professor in 2018.
