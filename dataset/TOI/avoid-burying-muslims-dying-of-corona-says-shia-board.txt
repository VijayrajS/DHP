2020-03-20
LUCKNOW: UP Shia Central Waqf Board chief Waseem Rizvi on Thursday said that Muslims who die of coronavirus should not be buried, but cremated in electronic crematoriums as this would burn the virus and help contain its spread. “If a Muslim patient dies of coronavirus, the patient’s family should not bury the deceased but perform last rites in an electric crematorium. This way not just the deceased but the virus in such a body will burn and get eradicated fully,” Rizvi said in a video appeal. 


“If the pandemic spreads further, the Shia waqf board may take a call if burials in cemeteries under its control should be allowed,” he further said. However, officials said that burial does not pose threat of spreading infection. “There are detailed disposal protocols if any person dies of coronavirus be it for burial or cremation. In both situations, the virus ceases to contaminate any further. In both methods however, protocols should be followed by those performing the last rites, for the transfer of body from hospital to funeral site and by others involved,” said UP state surveillance officer for covid-19 Vikasendu Agarwal.
