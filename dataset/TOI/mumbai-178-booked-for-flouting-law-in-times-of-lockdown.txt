2020-03-26
MUMBAI: A total of 178 people have been booked so far for allegedly flouting orders during the lockdown period, the police said.


Despite a complete lock down being declared in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, people still wander outdoors, shops not listed as selling ‘essential’ items have been kept open and those home quarantined have violated rules by stepping out of their homes, leading to them being booked by the police.

The city police also used drones in several parts of the city to monitor the situation. Joint commissioner of police (law & order) Vinay Choubey said no untoward incident was reported. He said shoppers were being allowed to visit groceries but they were required to maintain social distancing. He said the crime rate has gone down drastically over the last couple of days.

The maximum people booked on Tuesday were those who were found keeping shops stocking non-essential commodities open.

Also, cases have been filed against hawkers who did business and restaurants that remained open, said Mumbai police spokesperson, deputy commissioner Pranaya Ashok.

After prohibitory orders were passed, the police booked 18 between March 20 and 23. While 112 was booked on a single day on Tuesday, 48 were booked on Wednesday. These cases were registered in a single day on Monday despite the curfew order that was issued by the state government to take precautions against the Covid-19 virus. Apart from the above cases, another 35 cases registered from March 18 to 21 were for keeping establishments open. The police said action was taken for flouting lockdown rules and for disobeying instructions.
