Discrimination in times of lockdown
2020-04-13
Rajkot: “My parents ensure that my brother wears a mask whenever he goes out to buy something. But when I have to go, they don’t care if I go without mask.”These and many such complaints depicting the deeply patriarchal mindset of the society are flooding the counselling helpline dedicated to students started by Saurashtra University in Rajkot. Girls are pouring their hearts out to counsellors narrating the discrimination that they are subjected by their own family members even in such difficult times of global pandemic.Some girls even told the counsellors that they are better off in hostels as they get more freedom. “My parents ensure that my brother uses sanitizer and washes his hands. But I’m never advised with such compassion. Is coronavirus not dangerous for girls?,” said a student to a counsellor.Saurashtra University started this centre on Thursday to provide psychological assistance to the students during the lockdown period, specially those who suffer from anxiety about exams or results. However, the professors of psychology departments are getting more complaints from girls experiencing discrimination at home for the last three weeks. Yogesh Jogsan, head of psychology department, SU said, “This is a reflection of treatment meted out to girls and the preference given to males in our society. The issue has been only become more pronounced now.”A college girl, who studies in another state, told a woman counsellor on Friday that she feels her hostel is a heaven. “When I used to come home for a few days, I felt good. However, now that I am living with the entire family for three weeks, I can feel the importance given to my brother.”
