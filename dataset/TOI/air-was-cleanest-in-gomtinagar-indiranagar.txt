Air was cleanest in Gomtinagar, Indiranagar during lockdown
2020-06-05
LUCKNOW: Residents of Gomtinagar and Indiranagar breathed much cleaner air during the lockdown than otherwise. Air pollution level dropped by nearly 50% during the period as compared to the same period last year. 

In Charbagh, a commercial area that figures among the city’s most polluted, air quality improved by over 52%. In Amausi, an industrial area, it improved by 25%, shows an assessment report released by CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) on the eve of World Environment Day. 



Overall, during the lockdown, the mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentration in the city witnessed a drop of 44% and 35% respectively in comparison to last year during the same period, states the report based on data monitored at eight locations—four of them residential—between March 25 and May 31.

Gomtinagar recorded the lowest PM10 level of 90.1 micrograms per cubic metre of air in this period followed by Indiranagar and Aliganj with 94.7 and 98.5 micrograms respectively. These figures were within the permissible limit of 100 micrograms. However, despite overall decline, Vikasnagar recorded 112 micrograms PM10 per cubic metre of air.

Compared to the same period last year, fall in PM10 concentration was highest in Gomtinagar (50%) followed by Aliganj (45%), Indiranagar (44%) and Vikasnagar (39%).

The harmful nano pollutant PM2.5 too declined in concentration with Indiranagar recording the lowest—41.9 micrograms—followed by Gomtinagar at 52.8. Both were within the permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre of air. In Aliganj, it was 65.5 and in Vikasnagar, 65, which was more than the permissible limit.

Compared to last year in the same period, Indiranagar witnessed the highest drop (49%) followed by Gomtinagar, Vikasnagar and Aliganj with 37%, 26% and 23% respectively in PM2.5 concentration.

“Halting of construction/industrial activities and vehicular movement during lockdown proved to be a boon for the environment,” said senior scientist SC Barman, who led the research.

Even the commercial area of Charbagh witnessed PM10 and PM2.5 level drop by 59% and 52% respectively.
