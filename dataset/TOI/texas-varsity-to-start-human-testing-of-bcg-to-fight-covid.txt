Texas varsity to start human testing of BCG to fight Covid
2020-05-04
HOUSTON: Researchers in the Texas A&M University in US are asking hundreds of frontline medical workers to participate in a late-stage clinical trial of a widely-used tuberculosis vaccine that could help boost the immune system and blunt the effects of Covid-19 .


Texas A&M is the first US institution in the clinical trial to have federal clearance to begin testing on humans. Researchers hope to demonstrate that Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or BCG mitigates the effects of the new coronavirus. BCG, which is also used to treat bladder cancer, could be widely available for use against Covid in six months. “BCG is not meant to cure coronavirus but bridge the gap until a vaccine is developed. BCG vaccine has the broad ability to strengthen your immune response” said Dr Jeffrey D Cirillo, a professor at the Texas A&M. Healthcare workers will be the first people eligible for the trial, which is set to begin this week.
