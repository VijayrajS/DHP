KANPUR: A 60-year-old woman who was suspected to be infected with coronavirus, died at the Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital on Thursday morning.


The exact cause of her death is, however, yet to be ascertained and her medical report is awaited, said chief medical officer Dr Ashok Shukla.

“The deceased, a resident of Sadanand Nagar, Chakeri, was initially undergoing normal treatment at the ICU of the medicine department at LLR hospital, as she was a diabetic and suffering from chronic kidney ailment. After she exhibited symptoms of the Covid-19 virus such as fever and difficulty in breathing, she was shifted to the ICU of the Covid-19 ward in the maternity wing of the hospital. Samples of her nasal and throat swabs were sent for testing to Lucknow’s King George Medical University (KGMU),” the CMO said.

“She died in the ICU on Thursday morning,” he added.

Her travel history revealed that she had visited her son, an ENT surgeon in Delhi, earlier this month. 

Experts at the LLR, however, said that going by the treatment, she had developed infection in lungs due to chronic kidney ailment.

As per the coronavirus protocol, her body was sealed in a bag in the supervision of two officials. It was later handed over to her family members.

“We have asked them not to open the sealed bag. We have sanitised the body as well as both the wards where she underwent treatment. Ambulance that took the body to her home, is also being sanitised. Now, we are awaiting the medical report to ascertain the cause of death,” Shukla said.
