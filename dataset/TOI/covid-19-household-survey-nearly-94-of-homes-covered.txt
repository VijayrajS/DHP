Vijayawada: The ongoing household survey to track all foreign returnees has so far covered about 1.33 crore households out of the targeted 1.41 crore households. The state government leveraged its huge network of ward/village volunteers, ward/village secretaries, Anganwadi workers, Asha workers and other field-level staff to conduct the extensive household survey.

About 12,400 foreign returnees have been identified and mapped with the local primary health care team, comprising Asha workers, ANMs and medical officers, to monitor their health condition twice a day. Among these 12,400 persons, who returned to Andhra Pradesh in the last 40 days, nearly 7,000 people are yet to complete the 14-day home isolation period. 

Special chief secretary (medical and health and family welfare) KS Jawahar Reddy has asked foreign returnees to remain under self-home isolation for 14 days from the date of the arrival and not to have any contact with family members, relatives or visitors. “If they develop any clinical symptoms like cough, fever and have difficulty in breathing, they are advised to call 104 and if they are advised hospitalisation, travel in the dedicated 108 ambulance escorted by rapid response teams,” said Reddy.
