Lucknow: On the call of Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, members of Christian community in the city on Thursday observed a day of prayer and hymns for people across the world who have been suffering because of the coronavirus pandemic directly and indirectly.

Pope Francis had on Tuesday appealed to people of all faiths to observe May 14 as ‘World Inter-Religious Day of Prayer’ for an end to novel coronavirus.

Following his appeal, the Catholic Diocese of Lucknow spent the day offering prayer service at churches and streaming it live for people on their official YouTube channel.

“We observed the day with prayer, worship and singing of hymns. Members of our community also went forward to perform humanitarian services and distribute essentials among the needy at this time of health crisis,” said Father Donald D’Souza.

Confined to their homes, men and women joined in too. Anita Sampson, a homemaker, spent the day fasting and listening to Pope Francis’s address online.

“Prayer is our greatest weapon against the virus. Even if we are sitting at home safely, all we can do is pray, sing hymns in the name of God and do charitable work from time to time for the many homeless and poor,” she said.

“In difficult times, we must stand together for peace and humanity and should help in all possible ways to contain the virus. A large number of our Muslim brothers and sisters are already observing Ramzan, the holy month of fasting and praying. We, along with members of other communities, have been praying for the pandemic to end for many days. The Pope’s call has added fervour,” said Tina Francis, a resident of Sarojininagar.
