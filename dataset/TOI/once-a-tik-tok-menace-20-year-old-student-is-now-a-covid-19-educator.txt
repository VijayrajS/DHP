Once a ‘Tik-Tok menace’, 20-year-old student is now a Covid-19 educator

TRICHY: A ‘Tik-Tok menace’ until a couple of months ago, a polytechnic college student who was arrested for creating public nuisance is now helping the police during the lockdown. While he was arrested for disturbing people at public places and making dance videos, he is now using the same tool to sensitize people on fighting Covid-19 and maintaining social distancing. 

It was the inspector of Vadakadu police station who facilitated his transformation by taking the responsibility to release him on bail after getting nod from his superior. “Society had side-lined me for my mistakes and I was booked for disturbing public. I could have been behind bars for at least 15 days, but inspector Barath Srinivasan believed in me and gave me another chance to correct myself,” says T Kannan, 20, from Raja Kudiyiruppu village.

Kannan said the inspector instilled confidence in him and encouraged him to make Tik-Tok videos but this time for protecting the people from the novel coronavirus.

Arrested by Vadakadu police on February 20, he was booked under section 291 of IPC for public nuisance and section 341 for wrongful restraint. “Eldest among four children, Kannan comes from a poor family and we found during inquiry that he was misguided by his friends. Therefore, I requested my superior to give him bail and kept him under my watch,” said Barath Srinivasan. “I have made over half a dozen awareness videos educating the public on the measures to prevent spread of Covid-19. Now the same people who criticised me are appreciating me for by good deeds,” said a beaming Kannan satisfied at doing a good deed.

Pudukottai SP Arun Sakthi Kumar told TOI that Kannan was not a repeat offender and hence the inspector asked him to let him out on bail. “Kannan made use of the opportunity and also turned a Good Samaritan as we expected him to become,” he said.
