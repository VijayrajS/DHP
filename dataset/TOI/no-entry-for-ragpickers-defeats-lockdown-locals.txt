No-entry for ragpickers defeats lockdown in Delhi: Locals
2020-03-26
NEW DELHI: As the nationwide 21-day lockdown to fight the novel coronavirus kicked in on Wednesday, the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and some inhabitants at several high-end colonies in the capital barred waste-pickers from entering the colony. 

Chitra Mukherjee, the head of advocacy and policy at Chintan, which works with the community, said waste-pickers were doing a tough job at this critical time without any support and people should come forward with water and soap near dhalaos, and masks and hand sanitisers for them. “Instead, we are getting these complaints from many areas. This is the time to help, not boycott, them.”

Md. Tariqul, who has been lifting garbage from Defence Colony for the past 10 years, said a RWA member had called and asked him not to come due to the virus scare. “My friends and other workers have also received similar calls.” 

Some residents said they had reported the matter to the municipal commissioner and police. “Defence Colony RWA members are asking waste collectors not to come. This will mean over 6,000 people will step out each day in one colony to dump their mixed waste in dhalaos,” pointed out Bhavreen Kandhari, who has approached the authorities. RWA president Ranjeet Singh, however, claimed, “We only stop those categories of people who, as per police, should not come to the colony, such as casual workers and maids.” 

At B1A block in southwest Delhi’s Janakpuri, RWA president Navneet Singh Bhambri said two waste-pickers serving over 100 houses had been asked not to come to safeguard the residents.

With several dhalaos closed in many areas, locals are leaving their waste. by drains, which may eventually lead to clogging, said Amit Sharma, a resident of northeast Delhi’s Nand Nagri.
