Stigma over Covid-19 leading to social discrimination
2020-05-18
Indore: Covid-19 is curable in most cases but we have to follow certain precautions — the message should be loud and clear in the society to reduce stigma associated with the disease that has led to social discrimination of positive patients and even those making a full recovery, said experts.

Dr Nidhi Jain, psychiatrist at district hospital counselling patients on state helpline said, “We have come across cases in Bhopal and in Indore, where neighbours and residents of society have discriminated persons cured of Covid-19 and their families. This discrimination is in form of avoiding such persons, denying ration and supply of essentials daily.”

The discrimination goes on with members of family with any Covid-19 positive case, though others are tested negative, said Dr Jain. Stigma surrounding any disease takes place because of lack of knowledge leading to formation of negative thoughts finally culminating into discrimination. The state government should disseminate proper information about the disease, added Jain.

Dr Salil Bhargava, HoD respiratory department MGM said, “We are defeating Covid-19 infection with the help of immunity of our body in absence of any anti-viral drug to help so far.”

“We have to follow certain precautions like we do in other communicable diseases. But it should be clear in our minds that any cured person is not spreader of the disease and such discrimination should not be practised,” said Bhargava.

There are around 60 to 80 per cent asymptomatic carrier about whom we don’t know but remain normal with them. So, such things will not help in this fight against disease, added Bhargava.
