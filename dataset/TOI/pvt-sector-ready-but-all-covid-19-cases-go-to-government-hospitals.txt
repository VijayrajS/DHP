Pvt sector ready, but all Covid-19 cases go to government hospitals
2020-03-28
Visakhapatnam: Even though the government has said both public and private hospitals can admit Covid-19 patients, as of now, in Visakhapatnam or in other districts of Andhra Pradesh, the suspects and Covid-19 positive cases are all being treated in government hospitals.

A limited number of isolation and quarantine wards has been kept ready in major private hospitals as per the government order. Insurance coverage is also available for Covid-19 treatment at select private hospitals. Although patients prefer being admitted to private hospitals, but as of now, none of the private hospitals has neither treated nor been approached by people showing alleged symptoms of Covid-19.

A spokesperson from a corporate hospital at Ramnagar said: “We have five isolation beds and at our Railway New Colony branch, 32 isolation beds have been kept ready. Ventilators, doctors and equipment are all available in case Covid-19 suspect cases or positive cases are admitted. But we do not have test labs. Our ambulances are ready to pick up patients, if required. However, the health authorities prefer to keep all Covid-19 cases or suspects under one roof at the Government Chest Hospital or IDH.”

Concurring with this, Dr K Vijayalakshmi, in-charge DMHO, said: “Although private hospitals have been asked to brace for coronavirus-related emergency, their services are not required at the moment. This is because the suspects or patient admission is still low and manageable at IDH. Only when the government hospitals’ isolation beds are filled up, we will need the private ones to step in. Right now, we prefer to keep them all at one hospital. All 14-day quarantined persons, suspects or foreign returnees are kept at VIMS.”
