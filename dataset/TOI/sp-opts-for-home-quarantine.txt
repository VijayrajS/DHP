2020-06-14
A day after a district collector home-quarantined himself after coming in touch with a minister who tested positive for Covid-19, the superintendent of police too has opted for home quarantine for at least a week.

The SP is now the first senior officer from the Marathwada region to go for quarantine. Senior police officers privy to the development said that some policemen who were on security detail of the minister during his visit had met the SP for some official work. 

“A civil surgeon said that in order to get accuracy in swab reports, a person has to be tested exactly six days after getting in touch with a suspected a person,” said an officer. Accordingly, the SP will undergo a swab test on Wednesday or Thursday.

Authorities said that several policemen, including jawans belonging to special protection unit (SPU) who were on security duty with the minister, have also been quarantined.
