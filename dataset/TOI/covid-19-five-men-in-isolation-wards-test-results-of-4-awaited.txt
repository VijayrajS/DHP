Bengaluru: Five men with travel history to countries affected by Covid-19 were in isolation wards of various hospitals across Karnataka on Thursday. Test results of four are awaited. 

While three men were in Rajiv Gandhi Hospital for Chest Diseases (RGICD) in Bengaluru, one patient was in Bidar district hospital and another in Udupi district hospital.

One of the Bengaluru patients is a 33-year-old male, had travelled to the Philippines and returned to Bengaluru on February 26. “He self reported at RGICD and is under observation. He has fever and a sore throat. Another patient with fever and travel history to Oman was sent from Kempegowda International Airport on March 4,” said Dr C Nagaraja, director, RGICD. 

The hospital also has an Iranian dental student, whose mother had tested positive for Covid-19 in Tehran and on his return to Bengaluru, he self reported at the hospital and was found negative. “He will be in the hospital till March 10 when he will undergo another test before being discharged,” said Dr K Sudhakar, medical education minister. 

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Sudhakar said the public can complain to the health department about anyone spreading rumours or creating artificial scarcity of masks. “There is no need for healthy people to wear masks. Only those who have fever, common cold/runny nose can wear one,” he said. 

He added Covid-19 tests are only for those who have travel history to the affected countries and show symptoms of the viral infection. 

In a bid to address rising concerns across the state, the labour department on Thursday issued a circular stating that in case of an employee contracting the viral infection, employers must sanction 28 days of paid leave. 

Box: Pharma student under watch

A 24-year-old student of a city pharmacy college with recent travel history to Italy, who is showing symptoms of Covid-19, underwent a test on Thursday.

The student was in the midst of an internship at ESI Hospital in Rajajinagar, when she began showing the symptoms.

“We learnt that she spent three weeks with her parents in Italy and returned about 10 days ago. In the past 2-3 days, she developed fever and was referred for testing,” said Dr Imtihan Hussain, medical chief, ESI Hospital.

Her samples were submitted for testing at BMCRI lab and the results are awaited. While the girl is not hospitalised, she is under surveillance, confirmed health department officials.

Govt releases contact details

The health and family welfare department, in a Google document released to the media, disclosed details, including contact numbers of people who had come from Covid-19 affected countries to Bengaluru and Mangaluru and were under home surveillance. Realising their faux pas, officials desperately requested mediapersons not to try getting in touch with those under watch.
