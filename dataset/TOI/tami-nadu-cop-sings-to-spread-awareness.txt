CUDDALORE: A head constable from Cuddalore, Pon Sivaperuman, 41, who shot to fame in social media for penning and singing songs to create awareness on traffic rules and regulations among people particularly the school children, has now come out with a Covid-19 awareness song. The two-minute song was penned, set in tune and sung by him. He sent the video to the administrator of the Cuddalore district police social media wing, who promptly posted it on the district police's Facebook account, inviting appreciation from different quarters including the public. The cop in the music video urged people to lend a helping hand to the Tamil Nadu government in containing the spread of Covid-19 and eradicating the virus from the state and country. The only thing people need to do is to stay at their houses. Pointing out that the virus infects all sections of people irrespective of caste, creed, religion and nationality he said the only way to prevent the incidence is to adhere to social distancing norms. 


"The original video was close to five minutes. I rendered the stanzas twice in the original video. The music in between stanzas was also a bit lengthy. My seniors suggested to cut short the song as in this fast world however important is the message people will not have time and patience to watch a lengthy video. So it was edited to less than two minutes carefully without losing its main theme," said Sivaperuman. 

The cop inculcated the habit of penning songs, setting tunes and rendering them on a variety of themes since his school days. "I was selected for the police force and underwent training for one year before joining the force. I used to write songs on our experiences during the one-year training and sing them to my batchmates. But after joining the force I did not have much time for extracurricular activities. Of late my batchmates requested me to resume my passion," he said.
