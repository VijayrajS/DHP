Rajkot in ‘lockdown mode’ after first positive case
2020-03-21
Rajkot: With its first coronavirus case turning positive, the city has virtually locked itself up inside homes on Friday. Empty roads, sparse traffic, closed shops, markets and business establishments have mirrored the panic that has gripped the citizens from contracting the dreaded virus. Even the city’s gold market, one of the biggest in Gujarat, where over 70,000 workers are engaged in making jewellery has shut down till Tuesday looking at the heavy reduction in business. Jewellery design from Rajkot not only enjoys huge demand across the country, but also in foreign markets. President of Rajkot gold dealer’s association, Bhayabhai Soni said, “Looking at the safety concerns of our customers and also the workers and employees, we have unanimously decided to keep our shops shut till Tuesday.” He further said that the decision to open market from Wednesday onwards will also be taken according to the situation then. More than 400 jewellers are engaged in the city’s gold industry. According to the market sources, the decision to shut down has been taken to minimize the risk of virus spread from the congested sitting arrangements for the workers in old Soni market and also its narrow lanes. The main markets in the city including Dharmendra Road, Lakhaji Raj Road, Yagnik Road and 150feet Ring Road registered very scanty footfall during the day as scared customers imposed self quarantine on themselves. The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) ordered shutting down of all tea and paan kisoks on the road. Municipal commissioner Udit Agarwal said, “We have allowed shops to remain open because we don’t want to promote black market, but there is a notification of the police commissioner prohibiting the assembly of more then four persons even in shops. We have asked the police to strictly follow this notification.”
