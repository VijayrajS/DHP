2020-06-09
LUCKNOW: Another leap of 412 new cases pushed UP’s Covid tally beyond the 11,000-mark on Monday. The state bulletin indicated the dominance of western UP districts and urban centres in the high number of Covid load in the state.

While the top three districts Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr accounted for 128 of the 412 cases, 50% of the overall burden came from 10 districts, including Meerut, Baghpat, Hapur, Agra, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Firozabad.

Principal Secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said: “As on date, 4,320 active Covid-19 cases were under treatment in the state, while 6,344 patients, including 159 in 24 hours, have recovered and discharged.”

The state also recorded eight deaths taking the total of Covid casualties to 283. “Of the eight deaths, two were reported from Agra and one each from Kanpur Nagar, Siddharthnagar, Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur and Auraiya,” a health department bulletin said.

Prasad said 13,236 tests were done on Sunday, which is, so far, the highest in a day. However if one adds the number of pool tests undertaken, the number would cross 20,000 mark. 

“We are close to achieving the 15,000 tests mark – the target set up by CM,” he said. On an overall scale, the number of samples tested by UP crossed 3.80 lakh mark.

The bulletin revealed that the number of migrant cases were on the decline. On Monday, the total number of migrant Covid positive cases reached 2,982 -- an increase of 59 which is less than the rise recorded on previous days.

Of the remaining new cases Kanpur recorded 25, Lucknow 16, Rae Bareli 14, Gorakhpur 11, Jalaun 11, Bijnore 8, Ambedkarnagar 8, Hardoi 8, Kannauj 7 among others.
