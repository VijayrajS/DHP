Nashik: The Nashik district administration has issued a notice to a private hospital, which has been treating a patient with coronavirus symptoms, for failing to inform the district administration about the same.“A private hospital was treating a person with coronavirus symptoms. It is good that the medical reports of the person turned out to be negative, but the hospital had failed to inform the administration about the development. We have issued them a notice,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.Mandhare pointed out that the administration had issued a notification under the provisions of the District Disaster Management Act (DDMA) in which the civil surgeon, Nashik, and the district health officer (DHO) have been appointed as incident commanders and they will be taking all the measures related to containing the spread of the virus.“Under the provisions of the DDMA, organisations have to comply with the orders of the incident commander. In this case, the hospitals have to follow all government guidelines and report to the respective incident commanders of their region. The failure will attract direct action,” the collector said.He added that all the hotels, industries, resorts and recreational centres across the district have been asked to inform the administration about the movement of the foreigners or even foreign-returned Indian nationals if it is within 15 days since their landing in India.Meanwhile, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Monday took a round-up of the responsive agencies. Civil surgeon C S Jadgale, police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil, NMC commissioner Radhakrishna Game, district superintendent of police Arti Singh, CEO zilla parishad, Nashik, Leena Bansod and others were present at the meeting. Bhujbal advised the citizens to stay away from gatherings and follow all the protocols prescribed.He also appealed to the people to not buy masks, as they are only required by the people who are in close contact with a patient or will be dealing with them for long periods, like the nurses, doctors and relatives.Jagdale said that the Civil Hospital would require a few more ventilators and monitors for the treatment of patients if and when they are admitted. Bhujbal has sought a detailed list of the equipment required which, he said, would be forwarded to the state government and necessary steps would be taken.
