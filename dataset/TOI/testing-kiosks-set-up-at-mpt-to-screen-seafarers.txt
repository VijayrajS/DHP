2020-04-24
PANAJI: Two testing facilities are being set up – one at the Mormugao port and the other at Patradevi checkpost— so that the seafarers returning home can be tested for Covid-19.Health minster Vishwajit Rane on Thursday said the kiosk for collecting samples for the test is ready. Similar kiosks with testing facilities will be set up at the borders and other locations in the state, he said.


At the state executive committee meeting on Covid-19 chaired by chief secretary Parimal Rai, health secretary Nila Mohanan shared the plan to test and quarantine the incoming seafarers, as per the SOP issued by the Union ministry of homes affairs.

The health department intends to complete the testing within 24 hours and these seafarers will remain onboard the ship till the results of the tests are clear, the SEC was informed.

If tested negative, they should be shifted to an institutional quarantine facility for 14 days, and if tested positive, they should be shifted to the Covid Hospital in Margao.

Mohanan also said that the priority to deploy kiosks (to collect samples safely) has changed after the MHAs clearance for the seafarers to sign off at the port. In the first stage, four kiosks would be set up at MPT. 

After taking the sample by swab, the testing will be done at a facility at Bicholim, which is being set up now. She also informed that seamen who want to resume duty on the ships need to get their tests done by private agencies at their own cost.
