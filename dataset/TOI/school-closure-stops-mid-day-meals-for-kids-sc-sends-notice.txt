There are around 86,000 primary schools in the state where 1.1 crore-odd children get mid-day meals. The state education department has asked schools to remain shut till March-end as a preventive step to curb Covid-19.

An official said the government may consider providing mid-day meals only to children in rural areas, saying they may be affected more than those in urban areas. At the village level, it may be possible to provide mid-day meals at the children’s homes due to the short distance of travel required. 

On Wednesday, the SC took cognisance of the non-availability of mid-day meals. 

A faculty of a reputed institute in Mumbai associated with disaster management said mid-day meals must continue even during vacations, droughts and outbreak of an epidemic. “Anganwadi workers normally serve nutritious food to children, lactating and pregnant women so they do not get infected with the virus,” he said, adding government should try to curb the virus while applying other methods to control vulnerability. Incidentally, in Kerala, the administration has made arrangements to home-deliver the meals to the children.
