ROORKEE: City administration launched an online helpline service for public on Wednesday. The service will help people on several issues relating to coronavirus outbreak. The online helpline service “COVID-19 Helpline” can be reached at crcroorkee.in , officials said.


“Through this service, any city resident can ask for help during this lockdown,” Namami Bansal, joint magistrate, Roorkee, told TOI. Besides safety guidelines and details of the shops that provide home delivery, one can also find emergency contacts on this helpline, added the official. 

Meanwhile, a WhatsApp group has also been created for providing day-to-day information on lockdown to mediapersons.

“It is an effort to provide information to the media for dissemination to public as a lot of developments, arrangements and directions from our side are being put in place on a daily basis during this ongoing lockdown,” Bansal said.
