Vadodara: With the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city and most cases of the viral infection not showing serious symptoms, the administration is gearing up to segregate such cases based on their seriousness. This would also ensure an increase in the number of beds needed for treating such patients.

The administration has arranged for 2,000 beds to keep Covid-19 patients. As per the protocol, the facilities have been divided into Covid Care Centers (CCC), Covid Health Centers (CoHC) and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH). Vadodara will now have 1,500 CCC beds, 300 CoHC beds and 200 DCB beds in and around the city.

Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said CCCs will take care of patients who are asymptomatic and do not need intensive treatment. 

“As per guidelines any facility like a school to a stadium can be used for this. AYUSH doctors can take care of such patients too. We have identified space for 1,000 such beds in the Pioneer campus on Ajwa Road, 150 in an ITI on Ajwa Road, 100 at the High Speed Railway training institute hostel and 200 and the Right Way School in Tandalja,” he said.

Rao added that the CoHCs that presently have 300 beds capacity will look into treatment of patients with minor symptoms and will be equipped with oxygen facilities and doctors. The GMERS Gotri hospital will have arrangements for 130 beds for such patients while the Sumandeep and Pioneer Hospitals can accommodate 100 and 70 such patients.

For patients with severe syndromes DCHs have earmarked 200 beds. These include 120 beds in GMERS Gotri, 50 in the railway hospital and 30 in Sumandeep Hospital.

Rao said that the present lots of beds had been identified projecting the requirements till May 10 as the first phase. The situation will be reviewed and preparations will be made in the second phase between May 10 and May 31. More changes will be made after June 1 if needed.
