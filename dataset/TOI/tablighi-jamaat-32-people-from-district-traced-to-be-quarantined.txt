NASHIK: The Nashik police and district administration has traced 16 people from Nashik district, who had travelled to New Delhi for the Tablighi Jamaat congregation last month. All of them have been placed in quarantine, said Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare. 

The district collector said they had received details from the state government about 32 people, who had reportedly travelled to New Delhi. “After verifying, it was revealed that 16 of them are in Nashik. All of them have now been quarantined. They had left New Delhi between March 15 and March 25,” he said.

He added that all 16 are asymptomatic at the moment. “Three of them have been home quarantined, 13 have been institutionally quarantined. The officers will keep watch over them during the 14-day period,” Mandhare said.

Nashik Municipal Corporation’s health officer Rajesh Tryambake said, “We are keeping them in institutional quarantine at the Zakir Hussain Hospital in Dwarka. They are not facing any health complication. But to be on a safer side, we have kept them in quarantine.”

Nashik police commissioner Vishwas Nangare Patil said they swung into action soon after they received the list. They traced 16 people identified in the list provided by the state government.

The names and contact details of these remaining 16 people have been passed on to the offices concerned to ensure appropriate measures are taken.
