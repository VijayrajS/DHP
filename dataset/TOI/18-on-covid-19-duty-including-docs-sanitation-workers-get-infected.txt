HYDERABAD: At least 18 staff on Covid-19 duty, mostly healthcare workers including nurses, ward boys, blood bank technicians and ambulance drivers have been infected by the virus. 


Also among them are sanitation workers of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and cops. Another 15-20 Covid-19 patients in the state have been identified as direct contacts of the infected staffers and they are also undergoing treatment at the state-run Gandhi hospital. They are among the 1,136 patients in the state.


Among the healthcare staffers affected, many are from district hospitals.

“I was working overtime as there was a steady flow of patients. I had no symptoms of Covid-19, but had felt some weakness,” said a lab technician from Gadwal who tested positive. Coming from a red zone, the healthcare workers are among the other affected healthcare workers on Covid-19 duty in the area.

Staffers who came in frequent contact with patients like doing daily checks and ambulance workers from Karimnagar, Gadwal and Jogulamba are among the affected. 

The fact that during the initial days the focus on personal protective equipment was not much, is believed to be the reason for more staffers from districts being affected.

“Although the situation has improved considerably now, in the initial days there were major lapses in precautions. Also since a few districts were in the red zone the exposure would be high and the lack of protective equipment might have led to these cases,” said Dr Mahesh Kumar, president Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA).

“Not all of the staff on Covid-19 duty were provided PPES initially. They were supplied as and when available and of varying qualities,” said a nurse at the King Koti district hospital, where a few staff members tested positive.
