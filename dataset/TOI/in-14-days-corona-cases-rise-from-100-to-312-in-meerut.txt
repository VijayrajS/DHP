Meerut: With a major spike in Covid-19 cases of Meerut after May 2, a study of the number of cases has revealed that while it took 34 days for the cases in Meerut to rise to 100, at 14 days --it took less than half of the same period to rise from 100 to 312 – which is a jump of 212 cases.

The analysis was done keeping in mind the total number of cases until Friday 9pm. On Friday, the total number of cases in Meerut was reported at 312 cases (including one admitted in Kanpur). Out of these, 95 have been discharged and 17 have died – thereby making the total number of active cases 200 (including one from Kanpur).

Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer, said, “The major reason in the spike of cases in May is that vegetable vendors and others in the supply chain have tested positive for coronavirus. When their contacts were tested, they too tested positive. The vendors and others come under essential services and were in contact with many others. Before that, the cases were still under control.”

Doctors have reiterated that a complete lockdown can only help in containing the disease. In this backdrop, Meerut district magistrate Anil Dhingra had announced May 14 as a day of complete lockdown – with only milk supplies and medicine stores remaining open.

Several vegetable vendors and milk sellers have tested positive in Meerut till now – with over 70 cases being from the essential supplies bracket.

Dr Vishwas Chaudhary, Meerut district surveillance officer, said, “As many as 21 new cases were reported in Meerut on Friday. Their locations are being ascertained. We are continuously tracking the number of cases, and getting their contacts checked too. Contact tracing is the major way that the disease can be controlled and we are leaving no stone unturned for this purpose.”
