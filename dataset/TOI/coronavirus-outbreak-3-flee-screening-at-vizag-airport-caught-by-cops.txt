2020-03-05
VISAKHAPATNAM: Three passengers who arrived from Kuala Lumpur and were running fever, escaped from Visakhapatnam airport on Tuesday night after they were singled out following a thermoscan. 


Preparations were made to screen all the passengers when the three - the parents in their 50s and their daughter in her 20s - sneaked away from the airport under the pretext of going to washroom. 

CISF and airport authorities alerted the police and they were brought back to the airport area. 

They were sent to a government hospital. The 108 ambulance driver, followed by another ambulance service, refused to take them to the hospital. Finally, the district nodal officer for Covid-19 arranged a private ambulance. Dr P V Sudhakar, principal, Andhra Medical College, said: "Their attempt to evade screening could have put other passengers at risk."
