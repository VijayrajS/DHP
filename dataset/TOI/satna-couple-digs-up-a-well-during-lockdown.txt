2020-05-21
BHOPAL: In Majhgawan area of Satna district, which usually battles water shortage during summer months, a tribal couple has used the lockdown period to dig up a well that is around 12 feet deep. 


And now this well is being used by the couple and their neighbours for irrigating their kitchen gardens.

The well has been dug on government land in Barha Mawan village under Majhgawan janpad. A tribal couple - Chhotu Mawasi and his wife Rajlalli - have dug this well in 20 days, working for more than seven hours a day. Now government officials have decided to help the couple by ensuring that their well is cemented and dug deeper.

Sources said that on March 30, the Mawasi couple who were rendered jobless due to Covid lockdown, decided to dig a well. Diligently working from 6 am to 11 am and 3 pm to 5 pm every day for 20 days, they finally dug the well, said sources.

Chief executive officer of Majhgawan Janpad Panchayat, Ashok Tiwari, said, “There is water in the well created by the tribal couple; it is approximately 4 metre deep and 3 metre wide. There was a patch of government land in the backyard of their house where they have dug up this well, all by themselves. Though there is water in the well, we want the well to be dug deeper and get it cemented. We are trying to get these works done under the MGNREGS. The well would then be useful for all the villagers.”

“There is water scarcity in some parts of the Majhgawan, but recently we had undertaken many projects under MGNREGS and other government initiatives to recharge the water table and there has been a significant improvement,” Tiwari added.
