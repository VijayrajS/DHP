2020-03-27
Chennai: DMK president M K Stalin, in a video released on Wednesday evening, said he welcomes each and every word of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 21-day lockdown and the measures being taken by the government to fight the virus outbreak. He said people must strictly follow what the Prime Minister has said.

Stalin said though Tamil culture has “taught us to be together,” at present, what is needed is social distancing. People should maintain some distance even within families, said. He thanked doctors, nurses, sanitary workers and journalists and compared them to Army personnel guarding the borders.

“At present, several people have been affected by Covid-19. Some have died. More than 20 people are affected in Tamil Nadu. We must follow what Prime Minister said a few days ago on the 21-day lockdown as there is no other alternative to prevent this virus from spreading,” said Stalin.

Getting into finer details, Stalin urged people to use handkerchief or tissue paper while sneezing and coughing. One should immediately wash the hands with soap. “Use sanitizer regularly. Housewives must be careful while working in kitchen after using hand sanitizer as it contains alcohol,” said Stalin.

Similarly, no one should take medicine without doctor’s prescription, he urged. People with Covid-19 symptoms should seek doctor’s help, he said, adding that self-medication could be dangerous.
