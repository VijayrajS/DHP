2020-04-15
Mysuru: The authorities in Mysuru are worried as a patient with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) being treated at a private hospital has been shifted to Covid hospital following symptoms of Covid-19.

Though local lab has confirmed that the patient is positive, the state health authorities are verifying it and are likely to declare the result on Wednesday. 

It has sent alarm bells ringing as this could be the first community level infection of novel coronavirus, if re-examination results come positive. 

Six patients with SARS in Mysuru were examined on Tuesday. Of them one has shown symptoms of coronavirus infection. Health authorities are claiming the patient is a teenager while district officials are maintaining he is a septuagenarian. There were two patients with SARS from the same private hospital.

DC Abhiram G Sankar said any case of community infection will be examined by the state surveillance unit. Without travel history or contact of positive patients, contracting the virus is a threat. Admitting that samples of few SARS patients were examined on Tuesday, the DC said the patient, whose test result is being examined, is a senior citizen. 

Two discharged

Two positive patients, who are employees of the pharmaceutical firm in Nanjangud, have been cured and discharged from Covid hospital, bringing down the total tally in the district to 37. 

For the second successive day, there is a decrease in the number of active Covid cases in Mysuru.
