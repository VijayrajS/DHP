Nainital: A Dehradun local, on Friday, filed a PIL in Uttarakhand high court against Aman Mani Tripathi, an independent MLA from Uttar Pradesh, and his aides for travelling to Badrinath and Kedarnath in violation of lockdown

Petitioner Alok Ghildiyal has demanded a CBI investigation. He alleges that senior officials of the state issued permission to Tripathi in violation of the lockdown and therefore, the case should be handled by the CBI so that there is not interference from the state.

The state government, however, argued that police in both Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have already registered a complaint against Tripathi and his aides and thus, the case does not merit an investigation by the CBI.

The case was heard by a division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe. The bench has given the petitioner a weeksâ€™ time to make Tripathi and all those who travelled to state as respondent in the case.
