JAIPUR: SN Medical College doctors in Jodhpur were surprised and shocked when a person with no travel history and without any known source of contact with a Covid-19 partient tested positive for the disease on Wednesday.


The 65-year-old man had walked to the hospital with breathing problems. Suspecting him to be a Covid-19 patient, they admitted him and tested his samples which turned out to be positive. 

“The 65-year-old patient came to MDM Hospital’s OPD just like we recieve routine patients. The doctors examined him clinically. They immediately suspected him as a Covid-19 patient. However, since he told us that he did not have any travel history and Jdoes not know anyone who tested positive, it was unlikely that he would have the virus in him. But, his report shocked us as he tested positive,” Dr GL Meena, principal and controller, SN Medical College, Jodhpur said. 

Since it is first such case, health department officials rushed to Mansurai area to find out from where he got infected. “He has no history of travelling to foreign countries nor any contact history with anyone positive patient,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health). 

So far, all the 120 persons tested positive, excluding the 65-year-old patient of Jodhpur, have history of travelling abroad or they have a history of coming in contact with Covid-19 patients.

Taking it seriously, the state government issued direction to all government hospitals to conduct random testing at OPD with complaints of respiratory diseases. 

Acting on the order, hospitals have started testing patients with respiratory diseases to ensure that the virus has not entered at the community level. 

“From today (Wednesday), we have started testing of patients who have complaints of respiratory diseases,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, medical superintendent, JK Lon, Hospital, Jaipur. 

Besides, SMS Hospital has also started testing patients coming there with respiratory illness especially pneumonia, said Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent of the hospital. 

Health minister Raghu Sharma said they are taking all possible measures to prevent Covid-19 enter at the community level. 

He said the health department has identified 2,000 people so far who were in direct contact with Covid-19 patients. 

However, the major cause of worry, which doctors treating Covid-19 patients at the SMS Hospital have pointed out, is that almost 70% of cases tested positive did not show any symptoms such as fever or cough. “Also, four patients brought from Ajmer are all asymptomatic,” said a hospital official. 

These asymptomatic Covid-19 patients were carrying the virus, but were not aware of that, as they did not have any symptoms. “The Covid-19 patients without any symptoms can spread the virus to others. They need to be tracked as early as possible and need to be isolated,” said a doctor deployed in Bhilwara.

Bhilwara district collector Rajendra Bhatt has started measures to find out if the virus has entered at the community level. 

Finding asymptomatic cases during contact tracing has indicated that there is a need for an intensified screening.
