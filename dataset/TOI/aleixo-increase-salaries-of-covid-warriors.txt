Aleixo: Increase salaries of Covid warriors
2020-05-02
Margao: Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco has appealed to the state and Union government that “the salaries or emoluments of all our frontline warriors like government and private staff, doctors, nurses, sanitary workers, police, etc, who are involved selflessly in the fight against Covid-19 should be increased and not cut.”

Lourenco also demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant request the prime minister for reduction in excise and VAT on fuel prices.

“It will be a win-win station for the entire economy as it will lead to reduction of the prices of petrol and diesel and aid in lowering inflation, boost consumer spending, make Indian industry competitive and boost overall revenue benefiting the government, industry and economy,” he said.

“Calls by people of India, including Goans for lowering retail prices and passing on some benefit of the lower crude prices, have grown louder, but have gone unheeded so far,” he stated in the press note.
