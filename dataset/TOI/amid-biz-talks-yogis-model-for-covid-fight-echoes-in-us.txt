LUCKNOW: While promising to consider shifting of their business base to Uttar Pradesh from the trouble-torn China, US businessmen echoed Yogi government’s success stories in containing the new coronavirus infection in the state.


Giving this information, MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh, who held an hour-long webinar with the US-based industries under banner of the United States-India Strategic Partnership Forum on Tuesday evening, told TOI that the US companies sounded very positive on their plan to move out of China and consider UP as their new destination.

While the minister along with senior officers, including industrial development commissioner Alok Tandon and principal secretary, MSME and exports, Navneet Sehgal, represented the state, the US side was represented by over 100 companies, including Adobe, Boston Scientific Master Cards and UPS.

The webinar was organised by the MSME minister amidst the growing Covid-19 crisis in China. Representatives of the US firms said that they would definitely prefer UP as their next business destination as the state besides having a strong customer base also has adequate skilled manpower and a conducive working atmosphere.

The minister said that at the webinar he told the US companies about chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s sector-specific policies mainly in the defence, pharmaceuticals, food processing, electronics and education sectors. “The US investors took a keen interest in setting up academic campuses in UP after they were told about the Private Universities Act of the state and the impressive growth of the private universities during the Yogi regime,” he added.

Meanwhile, Sehgal said that the US businessmen also hailed the Yogi government for its fight against Covid-19. They were apprised of the Team-11 which was set up by the CM to check spread of the virus in the state, the officer added.
