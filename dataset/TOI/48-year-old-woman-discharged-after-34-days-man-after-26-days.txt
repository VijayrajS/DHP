Covid-19: Mysuru woman recovers after near 5-week stay in hospital, discharged
2020-05-14
MYSURU: A 48-year-old woman Covid-19 patient, hospitalised for the past 34 days, was discharged on Wednesday.

The case of P-204 had posed a challenge for the doctors. Suspecting that virus strain in the patient may be different from others treated in the district so far, health officials adopted a wait and watch policy in her case. She is one among four people in Mysuru who have spent more than 14 days in the hospital.

Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute dean and director Dr CP Nanjaraj, who heads the Covid lab, said the woman tested positive in tests even after two weeks. She was discharged after testing negative in two successive tests.

The woman remained healthy and asymptomatic during the period of hospitalization. Sources confirmed that her husband and son were cured and discharged within two weeks.

Her case had baffled the authorities as the woman tested positive in subsequent tests conducted after 14 days. Once a patient is tested positive, they are treated at dedicated Covid hospital and tests are conducted on the 14th day and another within 24 hours before declaring them cured. Patients are discharged from the hospital only if two back-to-back test results turn negative. Many are usually discharged within two-three weeks. Health officers said the patients are treated with a combination of three drugs: hydroxychloroquine, tamiflu and azithromycin.

Also on Wednesday, a man who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat convention in Delhi was discharged after 26 days in the hospital.

Deputy commissioner said the number of active cases in Mysuru district stands at two now. These two patients have also spent more than 14 days in the hospital.

The district reported 90 positive cases since March 20 with no fresh cases since two weeks. The district could be declared as a green zone if cases are not reported for another week.
