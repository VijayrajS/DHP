Ahmedabad: Dariapur MLA, Gyasuddin Shaikh, along with other community leaders, have begun an exercise to identify people who had gone to attend the congregation at the NIzamuddin Markaz in Delhi.

Gyasuddin claims that along with community leaders Master Arif and Mufti Adul Kayyum, he has begun taking rounds in the areas including mosques, and the trio are persuading people to get themselves treated. Shaikh said that on Monday, 22 persons who had attended the congregation came forward and were quarantined by the corporation.

He said that they first held meetings and if the community members agreed corporation officials were called in and the members put in quarantine. “We tell them that it is in the interest of not just individuals, but the community at large is put at risk by their presence.” 

Talking to TOI he said that the members are then persuaded for treatment.

So far, according Gyasuddin, 61 persons from Kalupur, 30 from Juhapura, 28 from Dariapur and 38 from Shahpur including the 22 quarantined on Monday were identified and were sent to corporation facilities.

Shaikh said that there are still seven to eight people in Bapunagar, Dhalgarwad and Jamalpur who are yet to be quarantined. Shaikh claimed that the community only has one problem and that is the reporting which is done by the authorities. “The authorities were projecting as if they were caught by the police,” he said.
