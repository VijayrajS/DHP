THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: To make Covid-19 testing fast and easy, efforts are on to set up swab testing facilities in all districts of the state. Apart from government testing centres, two private sector labs have also secured the nod for testing.

At present, there are nine testing centres in government sector and the new additions are Aster Medcity and DDRC in Ernakulam in private sector. Meanwhile, government has sought permission to begin similar facilities at Manjeri, Ernakulam and Kannur medical colleges.

“We are expecting clearance for these testing centres from Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology very soon. Once we get permission, each lab will cater to the samples in the district. This will enable us to give results rapidly,” said a health official. Lab facility has been kept ready at Ernakulam, Manjeri and Kannur medical colleges and only the nod from central agencies is required.

At present the testing centres in Thiruvananthapuram are Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, state public health lab and medical college hospital. Of this, (till date) RGCB is catering to samples collected from Ernakulam whereas the state public health lab is testing samples from Pathanamthitta.

Now, the central university in Kasaragod has also been converted into a testing facility. In addition to this, the other centres are Kottayam, Thrissur and Kozhikode medical college hospitals and national institute of virology in Alappuzha. Till date, samples from Kannur, Kasaragod, Malappuram, Idukki, Palakkad and Wayanad were distributed between these testing centres. 

With 14 testing centres coming into play in near future, the load of present centres will come down. The state is expecting results from 640 more samples (till date) and it has tested 13,339 samples.
