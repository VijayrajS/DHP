Centre updates Kerala’s Covid-19 death toll to 3
2020-04-20
Thiruvananthapuram: Even as the state government is yet to include the Mahe native’s death in its account, the Centre has updated the country statistics of Covid-19 with 400 cases and three deaths in Kerala while the state health department statistics say 399 cases and two deaths as on April 18.

However, the state government is waiting for the official communication from the Union ministry of health family welfare in this regard. “There were two set of guidelines issued by the Centre on accounting the deaths of people who are coming from outside the state for treatment or people belonging to one state and working in a different state,” said a senior health department official. 

Hence, there was confusion over whether the nativity should be considered or the place of treatment should be considered. For this, the state government needs a clarification and hence has written to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. 

But the Union health ministry has already accounted the Mahe native’s death in Kerala’s account. As per the national data released by the Union ministry everyday in New Delhi, Kerala has three deaths. The Centre’s opinion is that death should be accounted where it has occurred irrespective of the nativity of the person.
