2020-06-01
MADURAI: Doctors have emphasized the need to give up tobacco which harms the respiratory system more than ever especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.


The theme for the day, according to World Health Organisation (WHO), is “Tobacco and lung health’. “Though there is no direct evidence showing those who consume tobacco are more prone to Covid-19, poor respiratory health due to tobacco-caused chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can in turn aggravate if infected by Covid-19,” said Dr Prem Ananth P, interventional pulmonologist at a private hospital. As per latest statistics, more than 6.25 lakh children (10-14 years old) and 8.95 crore adults continue to use tobacco every day in India. “Apart from nicotine, all tobacco products contain other harmful chemicals. E-cigarettes have become popular recently with many believing it is safer. But, they too carry harmful preservatives,” said Dr Prem Ananth. Doctors said that statistics show that 68% of smokers want to quit but only around 8% quit without help.
