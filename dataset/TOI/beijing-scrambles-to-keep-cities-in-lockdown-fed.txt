Beijing scrambles to keep cities in lockdown fed

BEIJING: Communist leaders are trying to keep food flowing to crowded cities despite antidisease controls and to quell fears of possible shortages and price spikes following panic buying after most access to Wuhan was cut off January 23.


Food stocks in supermarkets ran low shortly after Beijing imposed travel curbs and extended the Lunar New Year holiday to keep factories, offices and other businesses closed and the public at home in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading. That also kept trucks off the road, disrupting supplies of food.

This week, a cabinet official acknowledged vegetable supplies were uneven and some “daily necessities” were sold out. “These problems are being coordinated and resolved,” Lian Weiliang, deputy chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said on February 3. 

Later that day, state TV announced the ruling Communist Party order local authorities nationwide to “ensure the supply of daily necessities”, including vegetables, meat, eggs, milk and grain. The following day, the agriculture ministry told officials to unblock transportation and “ensure normal operation” of livestock and feed production.

In Nanjing, a grocery store employee said, “Some people tried to buy a lot, but they are no longer doing it after seeing the abundant supply.“
