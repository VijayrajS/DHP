NASHIK: The Mumbai Naka police presented appreciation letters to 28 samaritans for their unconditional service during the lockdown in a small ceremony held in the station premises on Sunday.

The letters were presented by DCP Amol Tambe and senior PI of Mumbai Naka police station Vijay Dhamal. The 28-men were part of NGOs, special donors, and ex-servicemen.

Police officers said that many poor people were without work or money during the lockdown period. “There were homeless people, some locked down in shelter homes. Fortunately, some citizens understood the problem and came forward to help the poor with food, grains, etc which was given at their door-steps,” said an officer.

Apart from this, people have donated food, fruits, water bottles, etc to the migrant labourers, who were walking or cycling from the highway. “It became our duty to recognize the services of people, who came forward to help people. Covid-19 is a global pandemic and we have to overcome it by supporting one another. The gestures of these NGOs and individuals in providing food, grains, etc to the poor people helped in preventing the unrest among the needy, which eventually helped in preventing any law and order situation,” said DCP Amol Tambe.

A group of ex-servicemen came to offer their services by doing nakabandi duty alongside the police personnel at various junctions. DCP Amol Tambe felicitated such people and appealed them to extend their co-operation to the police whenever required.
