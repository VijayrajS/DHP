BAREILLY: A 48-year-old man from Shahjahanpur district, who was undergoing cancer treatment at a renowned private hospital in Gurugram, was diagnosed positive for Covid-19. The man got himself discharged and returned to Shahjahanpur in a car along with his wife, relative and the car driver and informed his parents about his condition on Thursday evening.


Soon, health officials turned up, checked his reports and brought him to a hospital. The man was on intubation and had difficulties in breathing which is why he was shifted to Lucknow along with all the high-risk contacts on Friday. His family members in Shahjahanpur are quarantined.

The man, a government employee, lives in Reti locality of Shahjahanpur. He had gone to Gurugram for treatment of oral cancer on May 25. He was getting treatment through chemotherapy. Upon returning home, he didn’t enter his house and informed his brother from outside that he was tested positive for Covid-19.

District immunization officer Dr Laxman Singh told TOI, “It was really a negligent act of the hospital as they should have informed government health officials about this case. Now we have sanitized and sealed the locality. The close contacts, wife, relative and cab driver, have been sent to Lucknow along with the patient where they would be isolated. The other family members are also quarantines and their swab samples have been sent for testing. The condition of the patient was not stable as he had breathing problem.”
