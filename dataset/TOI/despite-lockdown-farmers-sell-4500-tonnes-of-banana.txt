2020-04-20
TRICHY: The efforts taken by the agriculture marketing and horticulture department to help banana farmers sell their produce after the Covid-19 outbreak have started reaping dividends. Banana farmers from Trichy have sold out about 4,500 tonnes of the fruit to the tune of Rs 5.78 crore during the lockdown period so far.


Following appeals from the farmers, the state government instructed the district administrations to initiate steps to sell banana, which are ready to harvest. It may be recalled that TOI had carried stories highlighting the plights of banana farmers. Authorities from the agriculture marketing identified banana growers and helped them sell their produce at Uzhavar Santhai at seven places in the city and eight temporary vegetable markets, officials said. “We tied up with some farmers with Tamil Nadu Banana Producers’ Group functioning at Thottiam in the district. More than 40 farmers have sold out around 850 tonnes of banana for Rs 2.79 crore,” deputy director of agriculture marketing department Murugan said.
