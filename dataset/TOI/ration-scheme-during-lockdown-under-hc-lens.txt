Delhi: Ration scheme during lockdown under HC lens
2020-05-22
NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s ration distribution system for the poor during the lockdown came under the scanner of high court on Thursday, which questioned why e-coupon holders were left “high and dry”.

A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad was hearing a petition that said thousands of needy people in the capital were not getting ration under the public distribution system (PDS) despite having e-coupons issued by the state government. It alleged that new coupons were being issued, even as existing coupon holders were still waiting for ration.

The bench said it was “unacceptable that e-coupons were distributed in such a large number and yet e-coupon holders were left high and dry. Delhi government ought to have ensured that sufficient ration was available in proportion to number of coupons issued.”

Brushing aside request from the state government to give it a weeks’ time, the court fixed a deadline of Friday evening, to provide ration to stranded e-coupon holders in Sultanpuri and nearby areas.

The court acted on a plea filed by a third-year law student Shabnam, who argued that Delhi government had announced that e-coupons will be required to get ration immediately even if the person doesn’t have a PDS card. Yet, despite e-coupons being issued to 73 persons in Sultanpuri and 1,909 in nearby areas, they have not been delivered ration for the past one month.

The state government conceded that there was a paucity of ration at some PDS centres, but efforts were being made to supply sufficient amount to the needy.
