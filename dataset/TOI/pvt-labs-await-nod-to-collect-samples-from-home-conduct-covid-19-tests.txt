Private labs await nod to collect samples from home, conduct Covid-19 tests
2020-03-23
KOLKATA: With the central government allowing NABL-accredited private laboratories to conduct confirmatory test on swab samples of Covid-19 suspects, at least eight private facilities in Kolkata are applying for registration with the ICMR. Once they get the approval, which is likely to come in the next couple of days, they will start taking samples.

Once the ICMR allows private labs to collect samples from home, it could be a huge relief for many, especially those without symptoms or with mild symptoms, who are eager to avoid hospital isolation ahead of confirmation. But health experts said that collecting samples from home could pose logistic and safety challenges. 


TimesViewThe private sector needs to be involved heavily in the fight against the disease. Government hospitals and diagnostic centres alone will not be able to take the huge load that experts say is more than likely. 

“We will be registered with ICMR on Monday morning. We have trained our manpower and can start conducting tests to detect Covid-19 once we get the approval,” said Somnath Chatterjee, director Suraksha Diagnostics. Currently, ICMR-NICED and the IPGMER are testing Covid-19 samples across the state. Due to the rise in number of suspects and patients, the government has designated four more labs, including in Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, North Bengal Medical College and Midnapore Medical College as testing centres. These labs are, however, yet to start taking samples.

“With ICMR extending the category of people whose swab samples need to be tested, the rush for testing is going to be huge. It is impractical to restrict testing to just government labs,” said a health department official.

According to guidelines so far, samples of only symptomatic suspects, especially those who flew back from the affected regions and symptomatic persons who had come in close contact with the confirmed case, were being examined. Now, the ICMR has extended this list to those, who are asymptomatic but had contact with a confirmed case, symptomatic healthcare providers, any patient admitted in hospital with respiratory illness. “Labs for PCR testing for virology with at least bio-safety level II can test Covid-19 tests. Since we have the facility, we are applying for ICMR registration,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury, microbiologist at Peerless Hospital. The city has at least eight labs in the private sector that confirms the specifications laid down by ICMR. Alok Roy, chairperson, Medical Superspecialty, also confirmed that they are writing to ICMR for the registration. The labs are allowed to use US FDA-approved kits while the government has capped the charges for each test at Rs 4,500. Those running these labs said that if the government provides the primer to conduct test, the charges could come down to nearly one fourth. Diagnostics chains like Suraksha are likely to come up with a helpline number where people can contact to get their samples collected from home for testing. Alternatively, the labs have been asked to create separate sample collection sites.

“Ideally all labs should have an isolation facility for sample collection with dedicated manpower and proper personal protective equipment (PPE),” said Chaudhury. If any sample tests positive to Covid-19 at these labs, it will be double- checked by NIV Pune before coming to the conclusion.
