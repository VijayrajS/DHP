2020-06-09
Aurangabad: The name of a high school teacher from Parli in Beed, who had died about three months ago, was found in the list of employees assigned Covid-19 duties. The incident has left the administration red-faced.

Revenue authorities on Monday evening said the list has now been updated and another teacher has been assigned the job.

Recently, Parli tehsildar and in-charge of disaster management Vipin Patil issued orders appointing eight teachers from the Milind High School. While four teachers were deployed to Jagatkar Galli, another four were assigned duties in Bhimnagar. The deceased teacher, identified as Sachin Kaldate, had his name in the Bhimnagar roster. 

When contacted Patil said, “The list of teachers in our office was not updated. On realising the error, we have revised the order and deployed another teacher.”

Officials refused to reveal whose responsibility it was to update the records at the revenue office, which is currently supervising measures related to curbing and controlling the pandemic. School management and education department officials could not be reached for their comments.
