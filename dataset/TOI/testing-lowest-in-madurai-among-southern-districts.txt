2020-06-13
Madurai: Madurai has the lowest testing for Covid-19 among the southern districts according to data of the state government, raising concerns about the spread of the virus amid the growing number of cases every day. 

According to the media bulletin released by the government two days ago, the district had screened as many as 14,102 people up to June 8, making it 3,975 tests per million (TPM) population. The district has a population of over 30 lakh, including about 19 lakh in the city. However, districts which had a lesser population than Madurai, seen as the gateway to the southern districts, had more testing, statistics say. For example Tuticorin, with a population of just over 17.50 lakh people, conducted 13,227 tests, for the same period up to June 8. Also, compared to Madurai’s 3,975 TPM, Tuticorin had achieved 6,963 TPM.

Theni, when compared to Madurai, is a much smaller district with a population of just over 12.45 lakh people, but the number of testings done was 16,945, at least 2,000 more than that of Madurai. Sivaganga, yet another smaller district with a population of 13.39 lakh, conducted 3,506 tests per million, almost the same as Madurai’s.

Ramanathapuram has conducted 7,074 tests for its 13.53 lakh population, making it 4,676 tests per million, higher than that of Madurai. Apart from Madurai, Dindigul also had a low testing ratio with only 7,582 samples tested for a population of over 21 lakh, giving it a TPM of just 3,147.

Madurai District Collector Dr T G Vinay said they had intensified screening at places like Sellur where more cases were reported and fever clinics had been set up. About 500 testings were being done in Madurai a day and everybody who was coming from other districts and Chennai were screened at the entry point. Checking had been intensified in all the borders of the district.
