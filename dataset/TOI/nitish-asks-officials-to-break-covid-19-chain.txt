Holding a meeting with senior officers to review the work being done to contain further spread of Covid-19 in the state, CM further asked the officials to ensure contact tracing, sample collection and testing with advance planning so that resources could be utilised efficiently.

He said the identified hotspots and their adjoining areas should be completely sanitised to put a check on spread of the infection in other areas.

The CM said the departments engaged in providing employment opportunities in rural areas should continuously monitor the ongoing projects and ensure that maximum number of workers, who have returned from other states due to lockdown, get employment in their own gram panchayat.

He said the ongoing work of door-to-door screening of people on the pattern of pulse polio campaign should be done with more intensity.
