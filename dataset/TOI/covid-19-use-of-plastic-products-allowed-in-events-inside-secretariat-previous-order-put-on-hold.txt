Dehradun: Taking note of the need to maintain personal hygiene in the fight againstCovid-19, the state government has reversed its previous order, which banned the use of plastic products in meeting and workshops inside the secretariat. Till further orders, plastic products such as water bottles can be used in meetings and other events inside the state secretariat. A letter in this regard – written by chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh– was circulated on Friday. The CS told TOI, “Right now the focus is on Covid-19, therefore, approval has been given on use of plastic bottles in secretariat premises.” 

Earlier, on August 1, 2019, additional chief secretary Radha Raturi had passed directions, through a circular, to all senior officials of the state government that no plastic products should be used in meetings and workshops inside the secretariat. 

In the letter dated August 1 last year, Raturi wrote, “All are aware of the adverse impact the use of micro plastic has on the environment as well as human health. The use of plastic products is also a stumbling block in the sustainable development programme.”
