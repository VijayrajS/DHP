Pune: About 17 medical staffers, including doctors and nurses, of a civic-run hospital in Bhavani Peth were quarantined after a pregnant woman tested positive for the novel coronavirus infection (Covid-19) on Monday.

“The woman is in the sixth month of pregnancy. She was undergoing treatment for typhoid at the hospital. During treatment, she developed flu-like symptoms. Hence, we shifted her to Sassoon hospital on April 12. She tested positive for Covid-19 on April 13. About 17 healthcare staffers of the hospital have been quarantined,” said public health expert Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer of health (AMoH), Pune Municipal Corporation.

Of the 17 medical staffers, three are doctors and nine are nurses. The other five are attendants and ward boys. “They will also be tested for Covid-19 in due course,” Wavare said.

Bhavani Peth has emerged as a hotspot of coronavirus infection in the city. Maximum cases of Covid-19 in Pune have been reported from there.
