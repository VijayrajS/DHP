Lucknow: Don’t ask parents to pay transport fees for lockdown period
2020-04-22
LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday issued an order stating that schools across the state will not charge transportation fee from students during the lockdown period. Normally, parents end up paying between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 per month as the transportation fee.


The order issued by principal secretary (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla said that it has come to state government's notice that many schools are charging transportation fees despite the lockdown. “The government has issued an order and no school is allowed to charge transportation fee from students,” she said.

“In extraordinary times like these, when there is a pay cut several charges like transportation and miscellaneous activities add to our woes. We are thankful to the government for bringing in some respite,” said Shalini Gautam, a parent, who works in an automobile company. With her two children, one in class VI, and the other in class VIII, studying in private schools, the order means a saving of Rs 7,200 per month. Like Shalini, there are several other parents for whom the order has brought much-needed relief.

Earlier, the government had directed school authorities not to pressurize parents to pay three-month advance fees considering reduced earnings due to Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. Instead, parents were asked to pay fees on monthly basis. Instructions were also issued to not bar any student from attending online classes, in case any parent is unable to pay the fee during this period.
