2020-05-26
GANDHINAGAR: The state unit of the Congress has announced that it will hand over memorandums at all the district headquarters of the state, highlighting the difficulties faced by various sections of the society because of the lockdown.

The Congress has said that if the government does not respond to its representations, the party will approach the Gujarat high court, seeking its intervention.

GPCC president Amit Chavda said, “Trade, business and industry are facing an existential crisis in Gujarat. The state government is responsible for the panic created among the industries.”

He added that the party will demand the waiver of electricity bills for the period between March and June, the waiver of water and property tax for poor and middle-class families and the waiver of first-quarter school fees.

‘Probe Namaste Trump event'

The Gujarat Congress has also planned to demand the formation of a SIT to investigate lapses made by the Gujarat government in hosting the ‘Namaste Trump’ event, which possibly caused the spread of coronavirus in Gujarat.
