MOGA: A five-year-old girl and her elder sister’s short, witty video clips on TikTok for spreading awareness on Covid-19 have helped their family get Rs 5 lakh from the Punjab government. 


The family of Noordeep Kaur of Bhinder Kalan in Moga and her elder sister, Jashandeep Kaur, was presented a Rs 5-lakh cheque by Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans on Friday. The two sisters, in their videos, had been appealing to viewers to follow lockdown protocols to avoid spread of Covid-19. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had been sharing their videos too.

Noordeep and Jashanpreet’s father Satnam Singh is daily wager. Howeverm after the videos started to go viral, he stopped going to work and has instead been entertaining people who visit their house in search of the girls. “During the curfew imposed to contain spread of coronavirus, Noor and her team had been entertaining people with videos. Their videos asked people to confine themselves to their homes and adopt all protocols. The videos resulted in massively increasing her fan following, and this came in handy for the government too,” Hans said.

He said Noor had set an example of age just being a number if someone wanted to do something big. “It is unbelievable for us. Fortunes of our family have changed in a very short span of time. Her actions have changed our entire life for good,” said Satnam.
