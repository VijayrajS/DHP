With just 2-3 months worth of raw material, industry hopes Covid-19 threat subsides soon

Panaji: Goa’s industrial sector will face a severe crunch in raw material supply in the coming two to three months if the emerging threat of coronavirus (Covid-19) does not subside, said Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Manoj Caculo here on Friday.

While the tourism sector has already been hit by the spread of the virus, the manufacturing sector is yet to press the panic button.

“Production is not affected as raw material continues to come in. But if this continues, and it doesn’t get corrected soon, demand will drop and production will get affected. At present people have stock to last another two or three months. However, if any industry is dependent on raw material from outside the country, like China, they will not be able to sustain for more than that as raw material will totally be in short supply by then,” Caculo said. 

He was speaking to reporters in Panaji after a function organised by the income tax department to create awareness about the centre’s “Vivad se Vishwas” scheme.

Caculo said that while tourism has already felt the impact of the virus outbreak, the retail and auto sector are also showing a decline.

“The retail industry is suffering as people are avoiding going out to public places,” Caculo said.

Caculo also said the sales of four and two-wheelers has remained poor with dealers struggling to sell vehicles with BS4 engines.

“The four-wheeler sector is not affected much, but the stock of two-wheelers is a lot and it seems difficult that it will be sold by March-end. The auto industry is dependent on components coming from China and Thailand, so production could be affected, but since demand is low, production is also low,” he said.
