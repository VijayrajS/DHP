RAJKOT: A nine-year-old boy in Jamnagar celebrated his 10th birthday by donating Rs 11,000 to the chief minister relief fund on Tuesday. 

“When the entire country is fighting a war against coronavirus, I, too, would like to join the fight by making a contribution,” said Shlok Shah, the birthday boy. 

Chief minister Vijay Rupani congratulated Shlok by giving him a call. 

“Instead of spending lavishly on a birthday party or buying yourself an expensive gift, you thought of donating the money to us in our fight against coronavirus, which is commendable. You will always remember this day for the kind of noble work you have done,” Rupani reportedly told Shlok through video conferencing from Gandhinagar.
