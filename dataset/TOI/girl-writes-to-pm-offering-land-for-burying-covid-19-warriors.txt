MADURAI: A class IX student has sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing willingness to offer her family’s three acres in a village in Madurai district to be used as burial ground for doctors, nurses, police personnel and similar frontline warriors against Covid-19 who fall victim to the disease.


B Thennarasi, a resident of Katchaikatti village at Vadipatti taluk in Madurai and a student at Thaai CBSE School, sent a two-page handwritten letter in Tamil to the PM through speed post on April 22.

The girl told TOI that doctors, nurses, sanitary workers and police officials are rendering great service to the people for the containment of Covid-19. She said she recently read a news report about a Chennai doctor, who died after testing positive and was denied burial rights.

“The doctors, nurses, sanitary workers and police officials are putting their lives at risk and are rendering selfless service. I want to ensure a decent burial to these ‘heroes’. So I have taken a decision that our land could be used for this purpose,” said Thennarasi.

“My father L Bharathithasan is a farmer who has three acres of agricultural land in our village. When I told him about my decision, he appreciated me and immediately agreed to use our land for this purpose.” 

Bharathithasan said that Thennarasi was quite disturbed after reading the news report. “When she asked if our land could be used for the burial, I really felt proud of my daughter, who had come up with such a noble thought at this young age. I immediately agreed,” he said and added that though he and his family members are currently staying at his relatives’ house in Chennai, he helped his daughter send the letter to the PM along with the details of their land.
