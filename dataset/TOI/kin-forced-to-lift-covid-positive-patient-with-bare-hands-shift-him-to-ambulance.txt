AGRA: In a case of extreme carelessness, family members of a Covid-19 patient in Agra alleged that they were forced to lift him with bare hands and shift him to the ambulance on a stretcher on Saturday as the staff at SN Medical College’s general ward refused to touch him. The patient was admitted to SNMC on Wednesday but tested positive on Saturday. The family was not provided gloves and sanitizer and a video of the entire episode has gone viral on social media.


Talking to TOI, district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “I have seen the video and we will enquire about it from the hospital administration. Suitable action will be taken in this case. At any stage, carelessness in dealing with a Covid-19 positive patient will not be tolerated.”

According to the family members, the patient was shifted to the SNMC’s medicine ward on April 30. On Friday, staffers at the ward had claimed that the patient was not Covid-19 positive. However, on Saturday afternoon, the patient was declared Covid-19 positive. 

“We were told that the patient needs to be shifted to the isolation facility and an ambulance was made available. As the ward boys refused to touch my brother, I had to lift him and put him on the stretcher. He was not able to move on his own. I carried him close to the ambulance and again asked for help to safely transfer my brother into the ambulance. No ward boy came forward to help us. My sister joined me. Due to carelessness of the SNMC staffers, we are at risk of getting infected,” the patient’s elder brother said.

Earlier on April 29, the patient’s kin had also uploaded a video on Twitter complaining that their brother was not being admitted to the hospital.
