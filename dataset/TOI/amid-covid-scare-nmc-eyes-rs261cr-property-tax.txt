2020-05-16
Nagpur: Facing poor recovery amid the lockdown, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will start distributing property tax invoices to citizens from May-end.Assistant municipal commissioner Milind Meshram told TOI that printing of 7.31 lakh tax invoices for financial year 2020-21 is already on. All 10 zones will start distribution of invoices from May-end. To encourage early tax payment, 4% incentive is given for payment of property tax for the entire year before May 31.The NMC has pegged the current year’s tax demand to Rs261.60 crore from 7,31,421 property owners. Meshram said due to coronavirus scare, printing of tax invoices got delayed by a month this year. So, the civic body has decided not to impose penalty on the taxpayers till December 31. “This year, the NMC will not levy any interest for delay in payment of tax in this calendar year,” he said, adding for payment after December 31, a simple interest of 2% will be levied.According to the officer, those who pay half-yearly tax after receiving invoices before December 31 will get 2% rebate and those clearing the annual tax at a single go will be entitled to get 4% discount in their general tax amount.The NMC’s property tax collection in the last financial year was Rs245 crore. Last year, the NMC had delayed distribution of tax invoices because of non-focus works like Swachh Bharat mission, Lok Sabha and assembly elections. The coronavirus scare is all set to further hit the recovery due to poor financial condition of the taxpayers too.Standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke admitted to poor tax recovery by the NMC. “Once the city overcomes the Covid scare, I will ensure that NMC starts focusing on property tax collection and all 10 assistant municipal commissioners will be taken to task,” said Zalke.The property tax department has calculated Rs112 crore as current year’s demand from 6.60 lakh property owners, Rs57.19 crore from 65,238 residents, Rs12.12 crore from 3,488 citizens.TOI had already highlighted poor recovery due to absence of any punitive action by the NMC. Even in last fiscal, the NMC had managed to recover only Rs123.28 crore of the Rs233.73 crore current demand.
