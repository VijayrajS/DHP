Delhi: Shutters down in Khari Baoli amid coronavirus scare
2020-05-30
NEW DELHI: Panic broke out in the Asia’s biggest spice market in Khari Baoli on Friday after a few workers in two spice shops were confirmed as Covid-19 positive. Gates of one of its biggest sections—Gadodia Market were closed down. While some shops reopened later during the day, the spice market remained far from returning to normalcy.


Vijay Gupta, head of Khari Baoli Spice Traders’ Association, said that the shopowners downed shutters after they came to know about four positive cases from two shops. “Though a few shops reopened later, not many customers visited the market,” he added.

Gadodia Market has 300 spice shops, while the entire Khari Baoli has over 2,000 outlets.

Traders say that the workers who have tested positive are from Shakti Nagar and Madanpur Khadar areas. “Their positive cases will be counted in their areas. Meanwhile, customers are not willing to enter the market. If wholesale businesses do not function, how will the smaller shops get the supply?” Gupta asked.

Another Khari Baoli association member Suresh Bhargava too confirmed that panic had gripped the entire market. The Walled City and its congested markets pose a peculiar challenge in front of Delhi’s efforts towards controlling the novel coronavirus cases.

Chandni Chowk traders had earlier decided to keep the markets shut till May 31 on the ground that social distancing was tough to achieve in the congested areas. Sarv Vyapar Mandal head Sanjay Bhargav told TOI that instead of using curfew limits to achieve social distancing, the markets too should have been opened either on alternate days or on staggered timing basis.
