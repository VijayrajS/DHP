DEHRADUN: City police are planning to rejig the duty roaster of police personnel deployed on field during the lockdown. According to the proposed system, cops, mainly stationed on police pickets, will be working on any of the four shifts— five hours, four hours, six hours, and nine hours.

“Considering the rise in mercury levels, we are planning to come up with a new duty shift roster, which will come into force if the lockdown is extended. The new duty roster will be applicable for cops stationed at pickets,” said Arun Mohan Joshi, SSP/DIG, Dehradun. 

The official added that the first (morning) shift would be of five hours, followed by a four-hour shift during the hours when temperatures soars to the maximum, and the remaining two shifts will be of six-hour and nine-hours respectively.

Notably, majority of police personnel have become overburdened since the imposition of lockdown.
