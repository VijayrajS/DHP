PATNA: Twelve more districts will soon have Covid-19 testing facility as TrueNat machines are being installed in several parts of the state. The districts reporting more coronavirus positive cases with increase in the inflow of migrants are given priority in installing these machines.

As of now, Covid test is being done by Reverse Transcrition Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method at seven health institutes in the state, including four in Patna itself. Other districts have been tagged with these testing centres. State health department has recently given nod to two private laboratories also for conducting Covid test.

State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday night tweeted that 15 TrueNat machines have already arrived and were being installed at five medical college and hospitals and eight district hospitals. “Twenty five more machines are in pipeline. These would help us to decentralize and speed up testing (sic),” he tweeted.

Sanjay on Wednesday said top five districts with maximum cases will now have more testing facility. 

TrueNat machines are being installed at Vardhman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, Bhagalpur, Government Medical College, Bettiah, Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Medical College and Hospital at Madhepura and district hospitals in Rohtas, Munger, Buxar, Siwan, Motihari, Purnea, Katihar and Madhubani.
