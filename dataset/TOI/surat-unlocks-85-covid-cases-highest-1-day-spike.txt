2020-06-04
Surat: The ‘unlocking’ seems to have opened doors to many ills too with Covid-19 registering the highest-ever single day spike with 85 positive cases on Wednesday. This pushed the total number of Covid-19 cases to 1,781 in the city. 

“The daily surge in number of cases is thanks to people not maintaining social distancing, not wearing masks nor maintaining proper hand hygiene — which are the basic necessities to contain the virus. If we don’t change our lives, cases are bound to escalate further in the city,” warned Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, Surat.

Of the fresh cases, 17 each were reported from Limbayat and Katargam zones, while Udhna zone recorded 16 cases, said Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials. 

On the same day, however, 48 patients were discharged in Surat city. Of them, 16 were discharged from Covid Care Centre at Samras hostel and 32 from New Civil Hospital.

Meanwhile, two more patients succumbed to the virus on Wednesday taking the death toll to 76 in the city. The deceased include 40-year-old resident of Kosad, Biju Parmar, who was also suffering from anemia, while the other, Aruna Bhootwala, 61, was a resident of Udhna, who too suffered from co-morbid conditions like blood pressure and thyroid. 

While the civic body chief warned tea stalls owners to maintain social distancing at their shops, SMC shut 23 paan parlours and seven salons in city for violating rules. 

“We have been enforcing Covid-19 norms on paan parlours and salons and now we will enforce the same norms on tea stalls too as we have come across cases where rules are being flagrantly violated,” Pani said. 

SMC slapped a fine of Rs 7,000 on a quarantined person in South West zone for not updating his details on SMC Covid-19 tracker app. It also slapped a fine of Rs 35,000 on a gaming zone office which opened shop in South West zone under the Epidemic Disease Act.
