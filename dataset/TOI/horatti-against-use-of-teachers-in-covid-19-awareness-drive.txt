Horatti against use of teachers in Covid-19 awareness drive
2020-03-29
Dharwad: MLC Basavaraj Horatti wrote to chief secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar on Saturday, objecting to the deployment of teachers in the awareness programmes to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Vijay Bhaskar had on March 26 sent a memo stating that the government will form 100 primary and 900 secondary teams consisting of teachers and paramedical staff for the awareness programme. Each primary team will have one teacher and secondary unit two teachers.

Horatti welcomed the decision to form these teams, but took exception to the inclusion of teachers, stating that they are overburdened. He said that during his tenure as the primary and secondary education minister, it was decided to proportionately deploy employees of government departments on census, elections, economic surveys and other such works instead of teachers. “Now that all the government offices are closed and many employees are at home not doing any official work, they should be included in the awareness campaign,” Horatti said.

The MLC said he has also drawn the attention of minister for primary and secondary education S Suresh Kumar towards the issue.
