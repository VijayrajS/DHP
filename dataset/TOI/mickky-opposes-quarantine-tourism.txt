Mickky opposes ‘quarantine tourism’

Margao: Former MLA Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco on Sunday came down heavily on chief minister Pramod Sawant for “making Goa a hub of quarantine tourism”. 

Pointing out that three buses carrying people had ferried people to Betalbatim on Saturday for quarantining them in hotels in the village, Pacheco said that most of them were non-Goans. 

“I have no problems with Goans being brought and quarantined in the hotels. I am ready even to arrange free hotel accommodation for them for the purpose of quarantining them. 

But quarantining non-Goans in villages across the state is fraught with risks as they are found roaming on the streets,” Pacheco said. 

He urged the panchayats of the coastal belt, including those of Betalbatim and Nuvem, to voice their opposition to using hotels in their respective villages for quarantining people.
