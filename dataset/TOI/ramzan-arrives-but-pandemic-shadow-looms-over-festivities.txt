Hyderabad: Ramzan arrives but pandemic shadow looms over festivities
2020-04-26
HYDERABAD: Ramzan, the month of fasting, began in the city on Saturday without the traditional hustle and bustle associated with it. With the lockdown in force and Muslim clergy appealing to the devout to stay home and keep off mosques, the busy Charminar and its bylanes presented a deserted look. The historic Mecca Masjid too was abandoned with no five daily congregational and late night Taraweeh prayers. The Covid-19 pandemic has also robbed Hyderabadis of their favourite Ramzan dish, Haleem.

The busy market streets of Pathergatti and Charminar in were without people. Ramzan is the time when thousands of people throng Charminar to make the purchases right from the day one. The Mecca Masjid was not illuminated this time. The Lad Bazar where women throng in thousands to buy bangles remained closed. Many mosques had put up boards announcing that there would be no congregational prayers.

Special night prayers called Taraweeh wherein the entire Holy Quran is recited in parts spread over 30 days was not held in mosques. Offering Taraweeh prayers has been the tradition since the early days of Islam.

On the first day of Ramzan, people in were seen opting to shop for essentials and fruits in tyhe morning. This is in contrast to earlier years when Ramzan was a busy affair from dawn to dusk for businessmen.

“Although all of my family members are at home, the memories of past hectic Ramzan hurts a lot,” said Syeda Jabeen, a homemaker.

This year the handout calendars (Nizam ul Auqat), which used to range from postcard-sized printouts to pamphlets, have been circulated among members on social media platforms. “With the announcement of first phase of lockdown in India, most Muslims were mentally prepared that Ramzan has to be spent amid restrictions,” said Sirajuddin Anwar Pasha, a businessman.
