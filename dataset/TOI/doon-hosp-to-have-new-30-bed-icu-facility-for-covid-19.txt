2020-03-21
Dehradun: To better combat Covid-19 outbreak, a 30-bed intensive care unit (ICU) is going to be set up at Government Doon Medical College and Hospital (GDMCH). The proposal for the same has been sent to the health department for an emergency approval. Hospital officials meanwhile said that they would set up such a facility in 15 days.

A senior official from GDMCH told TOI that a proposal has been sent to the state government and health department in which a special fund has been sought under Uttarakhand Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020. The hospital has already started vacating its old administrative building to create a special isolation zone for this purpose. Elaborating on further steps being taken, Dr Ashutosh Sayana, GDMCH principal, told TOI, “We have a 24-hour helpline service through which our doctors help residents. We are also calling patients under home quarantine.”
