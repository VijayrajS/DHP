PATNA: Passengers arriving at Gaya international airport by international flights will have to undergo thermal screening in view of coronavirus threat. According to officials, thermal scanners will be installed at the airport by Friday.

Flights from Gaya international airport connect Yangoon in Myanmar, Paro in Bhutan and Hanoi in Vietnam. Unlike other international airports in the country, Gaya airport does not have Airport Health Organization (APHO) counter. 

“Thermal screening equipment reached Patna on Thursday and we expect that it would be installed at Gaya airport by Friday evening,” said ministry of health and family welfare senior regional director (Bihar and Jharkhand) Dr Kailash Kumar.

Gaya airport director Dillip Kumar said thermal screening cameras would be installed near the immigration counter, for which an area has been identified. “Announcement regarding thermal screening at the airport will be made in the flight. Directorate General of Civil Aviation has already issued guidelines in this regard,” he said.

As of now, passengers are manually checked at the airport and they have to submit a self-declaration form regarding their health and symptoms.

State surveillance officer Dr Ragini Mishra, who has been made nodal officer for novel coronavirus, said the health department was monitoring Gaya airport and the border areas. “Areas bordering Nepal are the biggest challenge as the neighbouring country has already witnessed one confirmed case of coronavirus,” she added.

As India's first case of coronavirus of a student from Wuhan University was reported in Kerala, the Bihar health department is on its toes. “We will keep an eye on the flights coming to Bihar from Kerala,” she added.
