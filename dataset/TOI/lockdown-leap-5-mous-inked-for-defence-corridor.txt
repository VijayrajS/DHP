Lockdown leap: Five MoUs inked for defence corridor
2020-06-14
LUCKNOW: During the over two-month lockdown, UP government signed five MoUs for investment in the upcoming defence corridor, taking the count to 28.

Also, the technical committee cleared paperwork of eight companies, which will now allow them to acquire land for their units. Five of these companies are seeking land in Aligarh, while three are scouting for space in Kanpur.

Government sources said, while major works like land acquisition were stuck due to lockdown, the government remained in touch with more than 300 companies, both international and domestic, through letters and on phone. “Instead of wasting time, we reached out to firms and told them about UP’s investment potential. Many expressed desire to invest in the state,” said a senior official.

The companies with whom MoUs have been signed over past two months include Anu Overseas, Cobra Industries, Kungarmour Private Ltd, Optic Electronic India Private Ltd and Deep Explo Equipment Pvt Ltd. All these companies will be involved in manufacturing ancillary equipment for the defence sector.

During the lockdown, guidelines under Defence and Aerospace policy were also prepared, which will help facilitate investments in the corridor. Meanwhile, DRDO set up an office in Gomtinagar and many more companies are likely to follow suit.

The defence corridor in UP is one among the twin projects coming up in the country, the second located in Tamil Nadu. UP government identified six nodes around which clusters of defence units will be established — Agra, Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Lucknow and Kanpur. At least 5125.348 hectare has been identified across these six nodes and 1055.6558 hectare has been acquired. This includes the entire 917.94575 hectare land identified in Jhansi. Acquisition in the Lucknow node is yet to begin.
