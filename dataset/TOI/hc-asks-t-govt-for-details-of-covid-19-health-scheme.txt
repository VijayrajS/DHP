High court asks Telangana govt for details of Covid-19 health scheme
2020-04-19
HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has directed the state government to furnish the details of its health scheme pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of the patients of Covid-19 by April 22.


The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice T Amarnath Goud was hearing a PIL filed by advocate P Thirumala Rao, who contended that the state has evolved its own scheme to attend to the patients. 




The Centre has already brought Covid-19 under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana scheme, but Telangana opted out of it and evolved its own health scheme, the PIL said. The bench sought the details of that scheme. 

It directed advocate general B S Prasad to find out how the Telangana government is applying this scheme towards the testing and treatment of Covid-19 .

Thirumala Rao told the court that while the state may think that its Arogya Sri is better than centreâ€™s Ayushman scheme, but it should explain to the people how its scheme is superior to the central scheme. 

The bench said it would ascertain those details from the state and posted the case to April 22.

The bench, it can be recalled, earlier called for a report from the Centre too, because the IRDA has issued a circular bringing Covid-19 under its purview. 

It also directed all the insurance companies to add this pandemic to their existing policies so that policy holders need not take fresh policies for this. 

The centre is yet to file its counter on this aspect.
