COIMBATORE: Authorities shut down Chennai Hospitals at Gandhipuram and quarantined a doctor and 19 nurses after a patient who tested positive for Covid-19 passed away on Friday night.

The deceased, a native of Palakkad in neighbouring Kerala, was running a hardware shop, deputy director of public health Dr G Ramesh Kumar said. 

“The 70-year-old man, who had uncontrolled diabetes,had fallen sick with cough and breathing problems in his hometown. Since he did not get better after treatment there, he came to Chennai Hospitals where his family doctor was working, on April 3. As he was diabetic and was suffering from breathing distress, he was tested at microbiological labs on April 7. He tested positive for Covid-19 on April 8 and died on April 10,” he said.

The hospital stopped taking new patients from April 8 after the patient tested positive, Kumar said. “However, since a doctor and 19 staff nurses were exposed to him, they have been quarantined on the hospital premises. They have no symptoms and their samples are being collected.”

A doctor from city-based SJ Gastro Care, who was treating the deceased for diabetes, has also been isolated, the official said. “She had visited him when he was admitted in Chennai Hospitals. Her samples will also be collected today.”
