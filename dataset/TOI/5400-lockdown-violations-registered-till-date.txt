PANAJI: Goa police, which is strictly enforcing the lockdown, has till date registered around 5,400 curfew violations, inspector general of police (IGP) Jaspal Singh said. This includes 301 arrests — 166 in North Goa and 135 in South Goa — and 208 first information reports (FIR). 


Till April 1, police had registered 1,746 lockdown violations.

Cases are being booked against those moving around villages and cities without permission of the authorities, shopkeepers for opening stores by defying government orders and, in some cases, even drivers transporting furniture.

Singh said that police have also collected fines to the tune of Rs 9.2 lakh.

The IGP said that his department has not only put out appeals on social media asking people not to come out of their houses during this period, but has also met religious heads and asked them to request their followers and devotees to remain indoors. Besides, the patrolling staff also persuades citizens to comply with conditions stipulated under the curfew, Singh said. 

Police patrolling has been intensified all over the state and nakabandis have been deployed at all existing patrolling points. Traffic personnel have been deployed along with district police at nakabandis.

Police have also been doing the rounds of grocery shops and supermarkets to keep tabs on whether shoppers out to pick up essentials are following social distancing norms.
