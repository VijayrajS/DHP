Reds slam govt for ‘exposing’ cadres to Covid threat
2020-04-17
Nagpur: The central committee (CC) of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) has issued a press statement this week holding the government responsible for exposing their elderly cadres like Varavara Rao and GN Saibaba to Covid-19 threat in congested prisons.

Though the press statement, issued by spokesperson Abhay, mostly highlighted the plight of migrant workers, daily wagers and labourers who have been thrown out of their livelihood due to the ongoing lockdown, the outfit’s concern for the senior cadres and their health inside jails too was prominently underlined.

The rebels’ apex body also condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to citizens to clang utensils and clap for the front-line staffers of medical colleges treating Covid-19 patients instead of announcing special pay allowances and packages for them.
