Kolkata: Testing takes a hit as labs struggle with connectivity
2020-05-23
KOLKATA: Cyclone Amphan has hit Covid-19 testing in the state as labs battled internet connectivity for the second consecutive day. Even as majority of the labs got partial connectivity from the second half of Friday, with poor signal, the number of tests was significantly low. Lab officials said it would take a couple of more days to return to full operations as they have backlogs to clear.

“We had started conducting about 1,000 tests a day. But the cyclone has kept us nailed for the past two days. We got internet connection partially back. After clearing the backlog we should be in a better position to be fully operational, hopefully by the second half of Saturday,” said Monika Pravhakar, head, Dr Lal PathLabs Kolkata.

Even as power supply is back and labs have their own generator back-up, generating results, communication with Swasthya Bhawan, uploading it on ICMR website and sending it to hospitals from where the samples came require internet connection. “We could proceed with only about 200 samples on Friday,” said Somnath Chatterjee, MD, Suraksha Diagnostics.

“Manpower has also become an issue as technicians and supporting staff of some labs could not travel as major thoroughfares became non-accessible. Despite this, some labs are trying to work in full swing,” said Justice (retd) Ashim kuman Banerjee, chairman, West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission. 

“We have started running tests. But since data generation and transmission are done based on an app, we need proper internet connection,” said an official at NRS that runs about 500 tests a day. The state had hiked testing numbers to over 8,000 a day and was planning to scale it further to 10,000. But on Thursday, the number dipped to 4,242. It rose to 5,353 on Friday.
