Maharashtra government yet to set up testing labs at GMCHs
2020-04-04
NAGPUR: Come Sunday and it would be two weeks since the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court directed the Maharashtra government to set up coronavirus testing laboratory in Government Medical Colleges ad Hospitals (GMCH) at Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Yavatmal. However, no progress has been made in this regard so far.


Additional government pleader Deepak Thakre confirmed that the government hadn’t submitted any reply till Friday. “I’ve talked with the collector and conveyed the HC’s directives. I need to submit an affidavit in this regard in the next hearing scheduled on Wednesday,” he told TOI.

Divisional commissioner told TOI that he had no idea of this particular directive from the court. He, however, said that the process to set up testing laboratories in GMCHs of Akola and Nagpur as declared by the Maharashtra government is under way and soon both would start functioning.

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote, on April 23, had also asked the respondents, including central and state governments along with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to provide kit to protect them from hazardous material (Hazmat) for the doctors, nursing staff and other health workers required to treat Covid-19 patients within a week.

However, there is no progress in this regard as well. The medicos are complaining of shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) and N-95 masks which are essential for these frontline warriors to fight against the virus. Else, there is every chance for them of getting infected.

On Thursday, TOI reported how doctors are forced to work with raincoats due to shortage PPEs and masks.

The judges had also directed to set up isolation wards at all central jails in Vidarbha for the prisoners within a week so that they can be kept there if tested positive for Covid-19.
