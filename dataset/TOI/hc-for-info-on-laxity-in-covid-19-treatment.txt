2020-05-08
Prayagraj: Taking cognizance of a letter alleging that first Covid-19 death in Prayagraj took place due to laxity in treatment, Allahabad High Court on Thursday directed the chief standing counsel, representing the state government to avail necessary instructions (information) in the matter.

Hearing a PIL registered as inhuman condition at quarantine centres and for providing better treatment to corona positive people, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Siddhartha Varma fixed May 11 for the next hearing of the matter. 

A high court lawyer, Gaurav K Gaur, through an e-mail had conveyed to the court that wife of Virendra Singh, an engineer had conveyed him telephonically that the quarantine centre, where her husband and other family members were lodged, lacks adequate hygienic conditions. Engineer Virendra Singh was first person who had died due to Covid-19 in Prayagraj. 

The letter also brought to the notice of the court that adequate treatment was not provided to Virendra Singh, who unfortunately succumbed to coronavirus on May 6.

The court also took cognizance of a video clip which is in circulation disclosing pathetic conditions at quarantine centres.
