2020-03-26
Vadodara: The cops have begun cracking down on citizens venturing out of their homes during the lockdown and earning wrath of some people. But amid the crisis, police is also extending help to the homeless who have nowhere to go. They have begun distributing food and water to the footpath and slum-dwellers across the city. 

After the state government announced lockdown two days ago, the police department began reaching out to the poor. “Those having homes and jobs can survive under the lockdown but these homeless people have nowhere to go. Many of them don’t even earn and with shops closed down and people off the roads, they won’t get any food,” said a police official. 

Footpath dwellers in Sayajigunj, Soma Talav area, Karelibaug, Makarpura and other areas were given food and water by the police as well as traffic cops. While the daily wage workers and handicapped persons were given food packets.

The cops, though, didn’t just stop helping fellow humans. Several teams of policemen fed stray dogs with biscuits and offered grass to cows in different areas. Even pigeons were fed with grains near Bird Circle by some cops. 

“We are ensuring that even homeless people stay safe and don’t suffer due to the lockdown. Some organizations have come forward to help us in this drive,” the police said. On Wednesday, some good Samaritans were seen offering food and other help to the needy amid the lockdown. The cops are allowing them to move around on humanitarian grounds. 

Casual labourers, who were stuck in the city for the want of transport, were helped by the cops to reach their villages in Panchmahals and Dahod.
