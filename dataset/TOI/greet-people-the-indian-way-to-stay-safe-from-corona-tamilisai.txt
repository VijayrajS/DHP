TRICHY: While saying that the custom of shaking hands to greet each other makes one prone to contracting Covid-19, Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said that it was time to realise the value of the Indian tradition. The Indian way of greeting people with folded hands has proved to be the safest way, she said. 


Speaking after inaugurating the new building at Santhanam Vidhyalaya Senior Secondary School in Trichy, she said it was time that people shunned western practices.

She said that as the state health minister C Vijaya Baskar has said the situation in the state was not alarming and there was no need not to panic. However, one has to take precautions to stay safe from Covid-19.

Tamilasai said she is the youngest among incumbent governors in the country, she said hard work and honesty were the two mantras to reach greater heights.

Later in the day while addressing over 500 women at an event at Femina Hotel, she asked them to face challenges in life without succumbing to pressure.

Tamilisai also visited the Sri Ranaganathaswamy temple, Srirangam and later travelled to Theni in the evening for attending another function.
