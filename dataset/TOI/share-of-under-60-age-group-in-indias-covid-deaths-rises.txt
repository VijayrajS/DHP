2020-05-01
NEW DELHI: More than half of the total Covid-19 deaths in India are among those aged above 60 years, while those between 60-75 years of age are most vulnerable, accounting for 42% of total fatalities, the latest data from the health ministry showed. Though less at risk, those between 45 and 60 years accounted for 34% deaths due to the disease.


The death rate was even higher among people with co-morbidities like diabetes, heart disorders and chronic kidney ailments and patients with such conditions accounted for 78% of total deaths. On the brighter side, more patients were being cured of the infectious disease as compared to a fortnight ago. The recovery rate among Covid-19 patients improved to 25.19% on Thursday, a reassuring increase over the 13.06% recorded 14 days ago.

So far, 1,075 people have died of the disease, whereas 8,372 have been cured, the health ministry said on Thursday. The total case fatality rate was 3.2%, and 65% of deaths were of males and 35% females. The health ministry recorded 33,610 confirmed Covid-19 cases, of which 24,162 were active cases till 5 pm on Thursday.





While a sizeable share of deaths was among people between 45-60 years of age, 14% deaths were reported among those less than 45 years. Those above 75 years accounted for 9.2% of total deaths. Though geriatric patients are at high risk, the percentage may reflect lesser number of patients in this age group.

While the government did not share the latest age profile analysis for positive cases, the data put out on April 6 showed that the infection rate was higher among younger people with almost 42% cases reported among 21-40 years old, while another 32.82% was in people 41-60 years of age.

However, the low case fatality among younger people was indicative that most of them were cured of the infection, whereas those above 60 and with co-morbidities were more vulnerable to infection with a higher death rate even as the number of cases remained low among the elderly.

Doctors said the elderly with co-morbidities were usually vulnerable to all influenzas because of low immunity and they needed to be more careful against catching coronavirus. However, the young also needed to be concerned about social and physical distancing as they would eventually move out to work once the lockdown was lifted.

The government has also advised people to maintain safe physical distances even within a family to avoid cross infection, particular among the elderly and those with low immunity.
