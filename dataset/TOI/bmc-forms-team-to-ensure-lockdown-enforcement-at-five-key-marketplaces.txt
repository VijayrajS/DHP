2020-04-20
Bareilly: In an effort to make Covid-19 lockdown successful in the city’s major marketplaces and ensure only permitted shops are open and follow guidelines, Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) has deputed a team to keep a tab on activities in the areas that have been granted permission by the local administration to function during the closure.The Corporation team will be making random inspections in the areas — Shyamganj, Allen club, Qutubkhana, City Station, Quila - where grocery stores and vegetable markets are open. Officials said that the move is aimed at easing burden of police personnel. The team will be keeping a check on unnecessary movement of people and remain in contact with police of the respective areas. Prompt action will be taken up in case of any lockdown violation.Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand told TOI, “The move comes after Shyamganj area of the city saw significant footfall despite lockdown, when the district administration gave a couple of hours relief to ease burden from grocery stores and other shops. Besides, there have been reports of a number of people thronging roads in areas where such shops and vegetable markets are located. People forget that they are supposed to follow social distancing. To ensure proper implementation of lockdown and see that social distancing is being maintained at the time when people come out to purchase essential items, a team has been deputed.”The municipal commissioner added, “Besides the police personnel, Corporation team will ensure that people do not assemble at one place while those caught venturing out unnecessarily will also be intercepted. The team will primarily be making regular random inspections at City vegetable market (City Station), Allen Club, Shyamganj, Quila vegetable market and Qutubkhana vegetable market.”Notably, after vyapar mandal members requested local administration to extend relief period in Shyamgamj market from 4am-10am to 10am-6 pm, hundreds thronged roads of Shyamganj. As people violated the social distancing practice, the members later requested district magistrate Nitish Kumar to withdraw the decision.
