LUCKNOW: Heeding to the appeals of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq and activist SR Darapuri, women protesters suspended their anti-CAA sit-ins at Hussainabad Clock Tower and Ujariyaon in Gomtinagar in the wake of coronavirus outbreak in the city. 


The Clock Tower protest began on January 16 and in Ujariyaon on January 19. Both protests were on the lines of all women protest at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh. 

Since the start of the two protests, 86 persons, mostly men, were arrested while 14 FIRs were lodged in which 2,500 persons were booked. 

“Women sitting at the protest site are brave and courageous, but at this moment, they should suspend the protest due to coronavirus. Once the pandemic is over, they can resume it. But at present, their health and safety is important,” Shia cleric Kalbe Sadiq had said in his appeal. 

Former IPS officer and activist SR Darapuri had also appealed to the women to suspend the protests. “There is no cure for coronavirus. We can only take precautions. Therefore, protesters must stay in homes,” he said.

As the women protesters left on Monday, police got the two sites sanitised. 

Additional deputy commissioner of police, west zone, Vikas Chandra Tripathi said women protesters left voluntarily. “We also dropped some of them to their homes. Clock Tower is being sanitized and police will remain deployed at the site untill further order,” he said.

Nasreen Javed, a protester at Clock Tower, said: “Even while staying at home we’ll continue our protest against the new citizenship law.” Another protester, Sana said “We will resume the protest after the coronavirus outbreak subsides.” 

Asma Siddiqui, who was among first 10 women to launch the protest at Ujariyaon, said, “The protest has been temporarily called off, following request from leaders.
