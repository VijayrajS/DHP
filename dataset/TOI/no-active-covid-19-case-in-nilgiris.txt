2020-05-29
UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiris became free of Covid-19 on Thursday when the sole active patient - a 24-year-old woman - was discharged from the ESI Hospital in Coimbatore.


The woman, a primary contact of a driver who visited Koyambedu in the first week of May, tested positive for the virus on May 9. A resident of Kozhikarai in Nanjanadu panchayat, she was undergoing treatment at the ESI Hospital for the past 19 days. She was discharged on Thursday as she tested negative for the virus twice.

Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya said, “While the district doesn’t have any active Covid-19 cases now, we cannot heave a sigh of relief. We have to maintain vigil and follow precautionary measures as in the past.”

She said restriction on the containment area of Kozhikarai would be lifted on Friday. The area was sealed after a pregnant woman, a returnee from Chennai, tested positive for the virus when she came down to visit her parents.

The Nilgiris has recorded a total of 14 Covid-19 cases.
