‘No virus risk as long as food is cooked well’

The city’s executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said as long as food is cooked well and long enough, there can be no risk of infection. “The only problem is with fomites (objects such as clothes and utensils that could carry infection),” she said. 

Chinese food has become a topic of discussion due to Coronavirus. Indonesia plans to ban live animals and certain foods and beverages from China. Many countries, including the UK, are reporting a drop in sales of Chinese food. German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has said given the virus’s transmission methods, infection from food exported from China is unlikely. Doctors said the fact that WHO has not mentioned Chinese food at all indicates the low risk associated with it. tnn
