Lockdown prevents people from protesting against water woes
2020-05-27
Jaipur: The rising mercury has further aggravated the drinking water problem on the outskirts of the city. People are complaining about low pressure and less supply time. Besides, lockdown has prevented them from holding protest over the issue.

Manish Saini, resident of Rana Pratap Nagar, said, “Pressure of water has decreased in the last two months. The problem aggravated further as my house is situated at an elevated place. In other areas of my colony, the pressure is also low. People have to order one water tanker a week.”

Due to low pressure, most of the colony people have stopped using more than one cooler and bathing with half bucket of water when possible. They have been trying to save water.

Similar is the situation in Chitrakoot Colony, Jhotwara where due to low pressure residents are suffering and have to order government tankers or private when necessary as the supply water is not enough.

Santosh Meena, a resident of the area, said that his tank is just one metre filled. “You can go and ask anyone in the colony if they have enough water in their tank. Water is usually supplied for one hour in the morning but since two months, it has been supplied just for 15 minutes. My family of six is sleeping in one room to avoid using three coolers. We have disconnected RO as it wastes some water as well. Sometimes, we have to ask drinking water from neighbours. We have complained against it but nothing has changed,” said Meena.

In many colonies of Harmada where Bisalpur water is supplied similar issues have been faced.

PHED officials assured that they will look into the matter and will resolve the issues as soon as possible. During lockdown, PHED has increased water intake from Bisalpur dam for Jaipur city expecting rise in water demand. In the main areas of the city including walled city water is supplied properly but areas in outskirts are ignored.
