2020-05-07
AHMEDABAD: The risk factor in terminating the 24-week pregnancy of a 14-year-old rape survivor who also tested positive for Covid-19 is unpredictable, a team of doctors at Civil Hospital informed the Gujarat high court on Wednesday, after the latter sought a medical opinion.

The abortion of such an advanced pregnancy is risky, but the doctors conveyed to the court that they would wait for its orders. On the other hand, the HC has decided to wait for the consent of the victim and her guardians, after they have been fully explained the complications involved due to the victim being Covid-19 positive.

The teen’s family moved the high court seeking directions to the medical authorities to terminate her unwanted pregnancy. She was examined a report was sent to the HC, which states that “as on today there is pregnancy of 24 weeks and two days and it is a risky procedure for termination of pregnancy. However, if the court passes an order then only the pregnancy can be terminated with risk”. 

The report also mentioned that the risk factor should be explained to the legal guardian of the victim and the victim herself as she is Covid¬19 positive and, “the infection cannot be predicted due to lack of enough evidence”. 

On this submission, Justice V B Mayani asked advocate Hardik Dave to explain to the victim and her kin the total risk involved in termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks and the fact that as the victim is Covid-19 positive and the risk factor cannot be properly predicted. The lawyer has been asked to report to the court on Thursday whether the victim and her guardians consented after they were explained the risk involved in detail.

The high court is likely to pass an order on Thursday after the consent of the victim and her guardians is conveyed to it.

The teen was allegedly raped by a relative and an FIR was lodged at Isanpur police station on April 23.
