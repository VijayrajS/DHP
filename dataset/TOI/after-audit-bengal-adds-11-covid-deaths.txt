2020-05-01
KOLKATA: Thirty-three persons have died of Covid-19 in Bengal so far, the number representing a 50% spike from the figure of 22 declared by the state government two days ago. 

The number of deaths the panel was asked to examine over the last six days saw a spike as well, rising to 105 from the 57 cases it had probed till last Friday.

Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha admitted the spike in Covid deaths but clarified that the fresh deaths were not reported in a day. “The deaths have not been reported in a day. As far as I know, there have been two deaths in the last 24 hours. The health department is maintaining records. The expert panel has examined the deaths and not (merely) the death certificates,” he stressed.

Sinha quoted the audit panel’s observations, saying there was room for improvement in medical record-keeping. “Doctors know the ICMR guidelines. They need to record the immediate cause of death and the antecedents and the underlying cause of death. But the expert panel feels this is not enough. They want front-line doctors to keep a detailed timeline of every case, from the onset of symptoms to the death. Proper documentation is a must,” he said.
