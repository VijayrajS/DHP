Within hours of getting permissions for conducting Covid-19 tests, the AMC had obtained primers and reagents from BJ Medical College and conducted 28 tests, consisting of positive and negative cases, all of which were sent to National Institute of Virology for opinion. “All our tests were validated and we can begin conducting tests immediately. Our team of microbiologists did the trial runs; obtained reagents, kits, probes and primers and conducted the positive and negative control tests within few hours. We are capable of testing 150 Covid patients a day,” said municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra.
