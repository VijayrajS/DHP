Rajkot: Two men from Junagadh and Jamnagar cities, who returned from Dubai last week, were arrested for violating the mandatory home quarantine rule. 

In Junagadh, 40-year-old trader was advised to stay at home for 14 days after he returned from Dubai. However, when local health department team went to check at his house on Saturday, he was not present. “They were informed that he had gone to Maliya-Hathina town where he has a shop,” said Pradeepsinh Jadeja, deputy superintendent of police, Junagadh.

The man was immediately arrested by Junagadh C-division police station team and sent to a government quarantine facility. He was booked under sections of Epidemic Diseases Act and sections 269, 270 of IPC (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and section 188 (violating public notification). 

Similarly a 34-year-old resident of Jamnagar’s Momainagar area, who was advised home quarantine, attended a marriage function in Maliya-Miyana town of Morbi district. When health department team went to his house on Saturday evening, they were shocked to know that he was attending a wedding.
