Prayagraj: For many Prayagraj residents the lockdown enforced in the wake of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is an opportune time for developing hobbies. Of the many interests which are drawing people, rooftop gardening seems to be one of the popular ones.

With too much time on their hands, residents are resorting to planting saplings on their terrace as a hobby.

Rajapur resident SD Pandey, who took to gardening during the lockdown, said that he had been planning to plant some saplings since the last three months, but didn’t get the time until now. 

“I finally got the time to take up gardening and plant my own rooftop garden because of the lockdown. I started collecting pots of different sizes and sowed seeds of vegetables in them,” added Pandey.

He said that because of the summer heat, he takes care of his plants early morning and in the evening. 

His rooftop garden is lush with plants of capsicum, lady finger, brinjal, gourd, coriander, mint and tomato.

Old City resident Ravi Kumar said that his liking for gardening takes up most of his free time ever since the lockdown was announced on March 23.

“I had all this free time and I was looking for something constructive to do. I then got the idea to use my terrace to cultivate a small kitchen garden. I have been growing spinach, bittergourd, flat beans, okra, capsicum and green chillies,” said Kumar.

He also has a word of advice for amateur gardeners like him. “Use large and deep pots as heat up quickly and do not drain water too fast,” he added.

City-based agricultural expert Manoj Srivastava said, “The availability of advanced and hybrid seeds has undoubtedly made rooftop farming easy for people interested in growing organic vegetables on like rooftops and terraces.”

“Rooftop gardens also help in bringing down the temperature in the house by at least a degree,” he added.
