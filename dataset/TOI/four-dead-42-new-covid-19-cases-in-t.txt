Hyderabad: Four more persons in Hyderabad succumbed to Covid-19 on Tuesday as Telangana reported 42 new positive cases in a single day. The state allowed shops and offices to resume business on Tuesday.

Following the deaths, health minister Eatala Rajender directed officials to conduct Covid-19 tests on all foreign returnees. He also directed them to conduct tests on police personnel, medical and healthcare workers showing symptoms without delay. “No one should neglect fever and flu-like symptoms. All hospitals should have enough oxygen beds,” he said.

While the death toll reached 38, the state’s coronavirus caseload touched the 1,634 mark.

Greater Hyderabad continued to report high number of cases with 34 persons testing positive for coronavirus.

A 75-year-old patient with hypertension, a 38-year-old woman with pneumonia, a 68-year-old woman and a 70-year old male with pneumonia were among the dead.

In Hyderabad’s Mata ki Khidki area of Yakutpura, the tests of 14 Covid-19 suspects came out positive. “Mata Ki Khidki area also had many cases earlier in April and was also part of containment zone. Rest of the cases were also from the containment zones,” an official said.

Apart from 38 cases from GHMC, eight migrants from Sircilla, Yadadri and Karimnagar also tested positive. The number of recovered people reached 1,011, with nine more people getting discharged.

A Covid-19 patient, who was admitted to King Koti Hospital on Tuesday, confessed to seeing a registered medical practitioner (RMP), who collected blood samples of the patient. The doctor was treating many people, sources said.
