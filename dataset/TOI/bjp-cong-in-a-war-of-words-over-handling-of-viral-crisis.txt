BJP, Congress in a war of words over handling of Covid-19 crisis
2020-03-07
NEW DELHI: Union health minister Harsh Vardhan criticised Congress on Friday for raising questions on how the Covid-19 crisis was being handled.

“Can the nation ever forget how @INCIndia led UPA Govt was mired in financial scams & public reeled under peak inflation during 2009-14? Shocking that Gandhi family chooses to demoralise the country at a time when world has come together to collectively fight this global crisis!” Vardhan tweeted in reply to a tweet from the verified handle of the Congress party.

Congress earlier stated that BJP’s attitude on coronavirus is “don’t do anything”. “PM and the whole BJP government is negligent towards the health of people,” the Congress party’s Twitter handle said.

The health minister said that taking a dig at the Prime Minister, who was personally monitoring the situation on an hourly basis, is proof of pettiness of the Congress party. “Rise above cheap gimmicks @RahulGandhi! And grieve not ! Mr Modi’s team shall not leave a stone unturned to protect our ppl,” he tweeted.
