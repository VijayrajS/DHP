AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation screened some 4,677 persons providing essential services and detected seven cases of Covic-19, as part of its drive to eliminate super spreaders. Potential super spreaders are those who are providing essential services and come in contact with large numbers of people.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said that on February 20, when the campaign was launched, 2,513 such persons were screened and 413 samples were taken for testing. Of these, three were found to be positive. On the second day, 2,164 such persons were screened and 141 samples were collected. Four of these returned positive. Thus, seven super spreaders have been found.

“All seven zones of the AMC have been asked to intensify the drive to check on potential super spreaders,” said Nehra.

Nehra said such person who contract the virus become super spreaders because of their work profile. If we had not detected these seven infected persons, they could have infected thousands within weeks,” he said.

The AMC has now achieved a testing rate of 2,600 per million people, one of the highest in the country. Nehra said 2,195s tests were done through passive surveillance and 13,725 through active surveillance. These active surveillance cases were cases detected by field teams of the AMC. Of the 13,725 tests, about 1,064 returned positive. Thus nearly 75% of the 1,420 total cases were identified through field staff.

Nehra said the city will get a new Covid-19 care centre with 4,000 beds in the western part of the city. “Since the Samras hostel and other Covid care centres will now have teams appointed by the government, the AMC team will manage a new Covid-19 care centre in a week,” he said.
