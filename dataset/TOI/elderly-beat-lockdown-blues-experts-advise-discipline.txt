Ludhiana: Covid-19 has disrupted everybody’s life, but senior citizens are the most affected. They are prone to infections as their immunity level dips after a certain age.

Loneliness is another prominent factor among the senior citizens. The circumstances are not favourable, but some residents have decided to see the brighter side of life.

Satish Mahajan, 72, and Chanchal Mahajan, 70, an elderly couple residing in Sector 32, Chandigarh road, are an example of the same.

“We understand that the situation is not easy, but we are trying to see things in a positive way. We have worked hard and now we see our children doing the same. It is not daily that the whole family sits together and spends time. Everyone is busy with their life. Meditation and taking care of our diet is another thing that we are focusing on.”

There are others too who are braving the adverse conditions on their own. Daljit Kaur, a resident of model town extension, shares her ordeal, “We are managing on our own. Wellbeing of our children in Toronto, Canada, is always on are mind. Our children call us regularly in a day to check on us. My husband is diabetic and he has to go out sometimes for getting essential items. I own a boutique and I miss my work a lot. We are taking care of our health. I practice yoga and meditation every day. Also, we are eating home cooked meals.”

Rajinder Mahajan Tony, 62, owner of the M D Mahajan Englineering Works, and a resident of south city, said, “Taking care of ourselves is the only option. Regular exercise, meditation and taking nutritious diet along with precaution is the need of the hour. There is nothing to get scared of.” Experts meanwhile point out that the mortality rate in Italy has been high due to the fact that 23% of the population is above the age of 65 years.
