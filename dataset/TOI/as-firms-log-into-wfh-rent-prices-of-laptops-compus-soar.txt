2020-03-20
HYDERABAD: As tech companies graduate to a complete work from home scenario due to the coronavirus threat, Hyderabad, which has about over 5 lakh IT sector employees, is not only staring at an acute shortage of laptops and desktops for sale but for rentals as well. What’s more, some vendors are learnt to be demanding double the going rate for providing dongles to companies as well, according to IT industry sources.


Sources in the IT sector pointed out that while there are hardly any new laptops and desktops or even rental ones available in the market, prices of the few pieces available for sale or rent have shot through the roof over the past week to 10 days.

“Vendors who were giving laptops with higher configuration on rent to IT companies for Rs 1,700-2,000 per month, are now quoting over Rs 4,000 per month,” said Ravi Rao, managing director, ValueMomentum, and secretary of HYSEA

According to Chenoy Trade Centre in Secunderabad, which houses several computer dealers, it is doing brisk business with dealers jacking up prices to cash in on the shortage of hardware supply from China, which accounts for a bulk of the manufacturing of these products.

“We had around 400 laptops that we have already rented out to our clients. Due to a spurt in queries from IT companies over the past week to 10 days, we have been trying to buy some new laptops but for the few pieces available dealers are quoting a premium of Rs 5,000-10,000,” pointed out Biplab Mondal of C Prompt Solutions that supplies laptops and desktops on rent to IT companies. Mondal typically gets queries for about 100 laptops a month but since the Covid-19 scare queries have shot up for about 5,000 laptops.

Another vendor, Kumar of D-Digitech said they have run out of stock of laptops and desktops on rent over the past week or so. “We had about 12,000 laptops and 6,000 desktops before but with demand for these shooting up over the past 10 days we don’t have even a single laptop or desktop available for rent.”
