PATNA: A 38-year-old migrant worker, who drove his bike all the way from Mumbai and reached his in-lawsâ€™ house on May 15, attempted self-immolation at a quarantine centre in Muzaffarpur late Thursday night. His wife and in-laws had asked him to stay in 14-day quarantine in the nearby Rajkiye Kanya Vidyalaya at Kamarthu under Gaighat block of Muzaffarpur district. 

Anand Surendra Singh alias Anand Shekhar Singh received over 65% burn injuries and was admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur. Singh is from Purnea district.

SKMCH superintendent Dr SK Shahi said the next 48 hours are crucial for the patient, who has been shifted to the PMCH burn ward for better treatment. Some inmates of the quarantine centre spotted Singh caught in flames after midnight. They somehow doused the flames and informed panchayat mukhiya Viran Ram, who arranged an ambulance.
