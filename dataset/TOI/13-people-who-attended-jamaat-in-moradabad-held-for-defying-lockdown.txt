They were booked for attending the event defying the lockdown. They were taken to a hospital for thermal screening and later quarantined. 

Superintendent of police (SP) city Devendra Peencha said that all thirteen of the arrested persons are residents of Haldwani city area.

“These people had gone to Moradabad to participate in a Jamaat event. As buses and trains are not running right now, they decided to walk along railway tracks. Police noticed them and took them for Covid-19 screening at a hospital. They will be quarantined and kept under observation, as per protocol,” Peencha said.

“They have all been booked for violating section 144 of the IPC and additionally been charged with section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC,” the SP added.

 “A primary investigation revealed that none of them attended the Tablighi Jamaat event at Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi, which has led to several cases of coronavirus emerging in differnt parts of the country,” he said.
