MADURAI: More than 2,000 police personnel and ministerial staff working with Madurai city police underwent medical checkup in the past one week to check for Covid-19 symptoms. Two people were found symptomatic, but there were tested negative for the disease.


A medical team from government Rajaji hospital arranged by Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham visited the spots where policemen have been deployed. The team led by Dr C Geetha checked for temperature, pressure and symptoms for covid-19. Those, who had temperature were asked for medical history and were provided with medicines.

“We visited more than 15 picketing points in a day and covered more than 200 personnel in a day. Only two were found with symptoms and both of them were tested negative. Many of them are aware of the symptoms of covid-19. However, they were sensitized since they may tend to be get carried away in the line of duty and neglect the symptoms,” Dr Geetha said.

Police officials said that on Tuesday, all the ministerial staff in commissionerate buildings were checked for temperature. All of them were told about the importance of washing hands frequently. Hand sanitizers and masks were distributed to the policemen. A similar checkup will be carried out in regular intervals until the pandemic comes to an end. Those with medical conditions were asked to take rest to avoid infecting others, they said.

Davidson Devasirvatham said that policemen get exposed to diseases as they come in contact with a large number of people on day to day basis. Medical checkup was organized to ensure that they stay health.
