BIDAR: A 25-year-old man hanged himself at a quarantine centre in Bidar district on Tuesday.


He and his wife had returned to the district from Mumbai, where he worked as a daily-wage labourer, on May 17, and they were placed in isolation as per the government’s standard operating procedure for people entering Karnataka.

This is at least the third suicide by a person in quarantine in the past month. On May 21, a 55-year-old man in institutional quarantine at a school in Kadandale, Dakshina Kannada district, was found dead. Officials believe he ended his life. The man and his seven family members had returned to Dakshina Kannada from Maharashtra on May 20. He worked at a hotel in Mumbai, but lost his job following the coronavirus-linked lockdown. 

Tuesday’s incident took place at Kittur Rani Channamma residential school, which has been turned into an isolation centre, in Vanamarapalli village, Aurad taluk, Bidar. The 25-year-old man was a native of Narayanapura village. Police are trying to ascertain the reason behind the extreme step. District in-charge minister Prabhu Chauhan and zilla panchayat CEO Jnanedrakumar Gangavara were among the officials who visited the spot.
