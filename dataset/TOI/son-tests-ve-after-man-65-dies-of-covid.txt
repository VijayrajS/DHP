TRICHY: A 23-year-old man from Pudukottai, whose father died of Covid-19 on Sunday, tested positive on Monday. The 65-year-old comorbid patient was the first casualty from the central region. 

Pudukottai has recorded 26 positive cases so far and currently there are 11 active cases undergoing treatment. The rest have recovered. 

According to Pudukottai government medical college dean A L Meenakshi Sundaram said the patient arrived with cardiac failure. “Anybody who is coming with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) we test them for Covid-19.

He arrived on Saturday, tested positive on Sunday and died in the evening. Though the patient tested positive, he died due to his comorbid condition,” said the dean. 

Pudukottai district deputy director of health services K V Arjun Kumar said his son also tested positive for Covid-19. While the source of infection is being verified by health staff, he said they suspect the infection could be from Chennai as the two had travelled to Chennai recently. 

Six close contacts of the two have been tested and their results are awaited, said Kumar.
