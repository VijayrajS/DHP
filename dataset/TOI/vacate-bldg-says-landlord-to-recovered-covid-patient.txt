2020-05-07
Tirupati: In spite of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s appeal to the public to not shun Covid-19 patients, a patient who recovered and returned home in Srikalahasti was asked by her landlord to vacate the rented accommodation immediately.

The woman who is employed at the tehsildar’s office, received a call from the landlord upon returning home. 

“When I was entering my house, my landlord called me over the phone and asked me to stay somewhere else for the time being and vacate the building after I find a suitable accommodation. It is surprising how people can be so inhumane. I immediately vacated the house and shifted into a smaller accommodation with the help of the tehsildar,” the woman said.

Srikalahasti tehsildar SK Zareena told reporters that after the eviction call was brought to their notice, “we helped her move into an alternative accommodation as she continues to remain under home quarantine.”

Meanwhile, another patient who works at the police department was discharged and returned home to Bhaskarapeta in Srikalahasti to a rousing welcome on Tuesday.

It may be recalled that of the 11 positive Covid-19 cases reported in Srikalahasti on April 19, eight were government employees who contracted the virus while on duty. Two patients who registered a complete recovery were discharged late on Tuesday.
