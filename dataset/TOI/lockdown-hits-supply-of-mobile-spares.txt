Hubballi: Lockdown hits supply of mobile spares
2020-06-13
HUBBALLI: The lockdown has badly hit supply of cellphone spare parts and the livelihood of technicians and traders who deal in phone accessories.

There are about 300 shops that deal in accessories and spares in Hubballi-Dharwad and, besides customer from the cities, they cater to thousands of clients from across North Karnataka. The business thrived with a turnover in lakhs of rupees every day, providing a livelihood for hundreds of traders, technicians and workers.

Now, following the lockdown, supply of display screens, batteries, speakers and circuit boards besides others, has been badly disrupted. Prices of mobile phones too have increased by Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000.

Rohit Kathigar, a technician, said: “Price of spares has gone up because of limited stock. The price rise ranges from Rs 50 to 500 depending on the part.” 

Sonali Miskin, a college student who visited a shop on Friday, said, “I normally change the screen guard every six months. Prior to the lockdown the price was between Rs 40 and 50, but now they are charging Rs 80 to 100 for it. When I asked why, the outlet owner said it was because of a shortage of spares.”

Sources say these shops rely on supplies from Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and China and it has been hit because of transportation problems. Screen guards went up from Rs 50 to 100, while back covers from Rs 50 to 80. The price for touch pad and display combo was Rs 1,000 before the lockdown, but now it’s between Rs 1,950 to 2,000. Chargers and earphone prices too have increased by Rs 20 to 50.

Santosh Kumar Murgi Patil, president, Mobile Dealers Association, said prices of phones increased because of an increase in GST (from 12% to 18%) from April 1. “Old stock was cleared after lockdown restrictions were lifted on May 8, but there has been inadequate supply of new stock,” Patil said.
