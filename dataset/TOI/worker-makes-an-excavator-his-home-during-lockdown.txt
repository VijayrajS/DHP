Pune: Golu Kumar, who moved to the city from Uttar Pradesh in search of a job, has made an excavator his home for over 45 days. Kumar drove the machine for a living and once the lockdown was announced he remained stranded near Shaniwarwada, where he had been working. Kumar was not allowed to leave the excavator so he made it his home. Now, he cooks and sleeps inside the small driver’s cabin.

The owner of the machine helps Kumar with the food supplies, including vegetables and groceries, once a week. The owner has also provided him with a gas cylinder and a burner. His lunch and dinner mainly include roti and rice but some times he also makes do with onion bhajias.

While Kumar was somehow trying to keep an eye on the excavator, someone stole the gas cylinder one night. “I woke up in the morning and noticed that the cylinder had been stolen. For the next two days, I had to live only on biscuits until the owner of the machine arranged for another cylinder,” said Kumar. 

The bonnet of the excavator turns into Kumar’s bed at night but the swarm of mosquitoes keep sleep away. While he does own a cellphone, his only means of entertainment is the radio on the phone.

Kumar moved to Pune from his village Fazlipur just ten days before the lockdown was announced to stay with his uncle in Kondhwa. He would travel daily to the construction site. He could study only till class XII and then he was forced to leave his hometown in search of work. He shared, “I get paid Rs200 per day for operating the excavator that is mainly used for drainage lines.”

He speaks with his mother everyday and all she says is he should return to the village safely. “I have heard that the government is sending migrants back to their villages. But if I go, then who will look after the excavator and my other belongings? So I have not filled out the form yet,” said Kumar.
