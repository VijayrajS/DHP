BETTIAH/ BAGAHA: Four hours after Raju Kumar Yadav, 40, succumbed in the isolation ward for suspected COVID-19 patients, a sigh of relief soothed fears at the Government Medical College and MJK Hospital at Bettiah in West Champaran district on Thursday.


“We have just received his test reports from the Rajendra Memorial Research Insititute (RMRI) Patna. The deceased was tested negative for COVID-19, ” hospital deputy superintendent Dr Sri Kant Dubey told this newspaper.

“The patient was admitted to the isolation ward on Tuesday when he came in with corona like symptoms. His samples were sent to RMRI,” hospital superintendent Dr Dhirendra Kumar Singh said earlier while confirming the patient’s death.

Hailing from Ambedkarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav was living in Raxaul bordering Nepal. The migrant labourer was referred to the medical college at Bettiah by the primary health centre at Raxaul when he came in with COVID-19-like symptoms on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, PHC and APHC located rural and urban areas in Bagaha are on high alert for Covid-19. In order to tackle any urgent situation, a 100-bed isolation ward is being made at Bagaha.

Bagaha SDM Vishal Raj said on Thursday that a double-storey building for training of ANMs on the premises of Kamalnath Tiwari government sub-divisional hospital, Bagaha, has been selected by the health department for creation of isolation ward. The SDM said that 30 beds are ready.
