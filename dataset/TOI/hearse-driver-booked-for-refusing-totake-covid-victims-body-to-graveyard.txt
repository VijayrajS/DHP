Bareilly: A hearse driver and a sanitary worker were booked on Friday for refusing to take a Covid-19 victim’s body to graveyard in Sambhal. Notably, a 76-year-old Tablighi Jamaat man, who was from Tamil Nadu, died of Covid-19 on April 14 after being shifted to Moradabad in a critical condition. 

SP Yamuna Prasad said the two disobedient men clearly refused after being instructed by chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Anita Singh to perform their duties. CMO Singh said that she has written to relevant agencies to take action against the driver and the sanitary worker. And an FIR was later lodged against both the workers at Behjoi police station. "Since Covid-19 has been declared a pandemic, it is not expected from anyone to refuse a task assigned to him," the CMO added.

“The deceased man from Tamil Nadu had tested corona positive on April 13. Since the driver on hearse duty didn’t respond to my calls even after several attempts, I had to arrange '108' ambulance for emergency service to take the body from Moradabad to Sambhal,” the CMO said, adding that at the community health centre, when the body arrived the sanitary worker refused to touch it despite being provided with all safety gears and PPE kit.

Confirming the FIR, SHO Ravindra Pratap Singh said, “We have received a complaint in which it has been stated that the driver had switched off his mobile phone while the sanitary worker had refused to join duty. We are lodging an FIR under relevant sections of IPC.”

Meanwhile, the 76-year-old man's body was buried at the graveyard on Thursday evening with all the rituals. CHC in-charge Dr Juhaib Karim was present on the occasion.

The deceased Jamaat man was quarantined on March 31 along with 10 other Jamaatis who had attended the Delhi event in March. On April 10, his condition started to deteriorate and later he was found positive for Covid-19.
