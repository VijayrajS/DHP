MUMBAI: Two foreign nationals, who were quarantined last week at Kasturba Hospital, Chinchpokli for the suspected novel coronavirus, were discharged on Sunday. State officials said 72 people with travel history to China were currently under observation across the state, but only five were hospitalized. 


A 21-year-old African national who was in China till arriving to the city on January 25, was quarantined on Thursday. The other traveller, a 32-year-old airline crew member, who came to the city on Wednesday from Beijing, was also isolated at Kasturba on the same day. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said both tested negative for the virus and were thus discharged. 

"As per the new protocols, no repeat tests would be necessary, so we discharged them. We don't have any patients quarantined currently," said Kakani. Eight patients were admitted at Kasturba for the virus since last week but all have tested negative.

State officials said that over 6,432 travellers arriving at the international airport have been screened, of which 72 were kept under observation. So far, India has reported two positive cases.

Two other travellers were isolated at a civic hospital in Pune on Saturday and Sunday, after they complained of minor illness including cold, cough and fever. Both had returned from China recently. Their reports are awaited.
