2020-05-26
VIJAYAWADA: The Krishna district administration and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) is focusing on compulsory home quarantine for all foreign returnees and inter-state passengers. As the number of Covid-19 cases in the district comes under control, officials are keeping track of persons with home quarantine stamps to contain the spread of the virus.


With domestic flight services to and from the state resuming today, the district administration will collect passenger details of those arriving in the city. Passengers will be stamped with the home quarantine mark and date on their hand and be counseled to not venture outside until the completion of the 14 day quarantine period. 



Volunteers and health secretaries of specific wards will be alerted and ensure instructions on home quarantine are followed. 

The district administration and the VMC are also directing efforts to ensure social distancing at business units is maintained after restrictions were relaxed in lockdown 4.0. Special teams are inspecting shops and warning establishments that are not following guidelines.

Safety gear such as masks and hand sanitizers have been made mandatory at every business unit.

Meanwhile, Vijayawada city reported only three positive Covid-19 cases on Monday, causing much relief to officials who have been battling to bring down the numbers. District authorities said a majority of Covid-19 cases in the district are stable and the number of active cases is coming down.

Officials are looking to bring down the number of cases in KL Rao Nagar and Patamata Lanka which have seen a recent rise in numbers. Sanitation activities continue at Machavaram and Krishna Lanka, two major hotspots.
