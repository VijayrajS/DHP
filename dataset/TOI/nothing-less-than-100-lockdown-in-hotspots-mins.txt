All essential commodities should be supplied at their doorstep. If anybody wants to distribute commodities to the people living in the containment areas, they should consult the GHMC and police department,” the minister said.

He asked the health department to visit every household in the hotspots and suspected cases should be sent to the hospital. The minister also stressed the need of coordination among the police, GHMC and health departments officials in combating the situation.
