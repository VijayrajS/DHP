MUMBAI: A 53-year-old physician from the western suburbs and two of his family members have tested positive for Covid-19, making him perhaps the first medical professional here to catch the infection. The trio is undergoing treatment in a private hospital and is said to be stable.


Unlike most other coronavirus positive patients in Mumbai, the doctor didn’t have a travel history. BMC officials didn’t officially confirm the case, but told TOI that apart from practising in his own clinic, he also consulted in two hospitals nearby. The civic body has started a contact tracing exercise.

 
 
One of the hospitals where he is likely to have consulted after developing mild symptoms has collected the names of 60 patients and handed it to the BMC. Incidentally, in the same hospital, the doctor had treated an influenza H1N1patient who tested negative for Covid-19.

The hospital in the western suburbs said the doctor had taken leave around two days after developing cough and fever. “On his last day here, he had checked around 20 patients in the OPD and another 20-odd in the wards. The resident medical officer and a nurse who had worked with him on that day have been put under home quarantine,” said a senior management official of the hospital, adding that BMC has sanitised the room where he consulted and the building premises.

His 43-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter also tested positive. His son’s report was negative. “His brother lives nearby and was tested but his report is negative. We have started our exercise of contact tracing for all three,” said Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward. He added that locals were counselled by teams formed at the ward level that there is no need to panic.
