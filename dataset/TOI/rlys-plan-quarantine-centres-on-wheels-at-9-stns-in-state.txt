Bhubaneswar: Nine stations in Odisha to have Covid-19 care rail coaches, after the Centre decided to convert railway coaches into Covid Care Centres at 215 stations across the country. Both suspected and confirmed cases can be housed in the railway coaches.

The stations in Odisha are Bhubaneswar, Khurda Road, Sambalpur, Titlagarh and Kantabanji in Balangir district, Rayagada, Koraput, Jharsuguda and Rourkela. Healthcare staff from Railways are available at Bhubaneswar and Khurda Road stations only.

The ministry of railways initiated conversion of train coaches to provide additional beds for Covid-19 patients as and when required. 

On April 2, the East Coast Railway (ECoR) had told the media that it will convert 261 train coaches to serve as quarantine or isolation facilities for Covid-19 suspected cases.

The quarantine centres will have essential facilities like mosquito nets on the windows, one bathroom and three toilets in a coach, removal of middle berth, six liquid soap dispensers in each coach, bottle holders and dustbins, laptop and mobile charging facilities, pillow and bedsheets, plastic curtains at both ends of the aisle, mug and buckets in the bathrooms.

“The state government will connect one hospital dedicated to Covid-19 with each train so that patients can be shifted to the hospital in case of emergency. The state will make suitable ambulance arrangements to shift the patient. Preferably one basic life support ambulance with oxygen and Ambubag should be stationed at the railway station where the train is placed,” said an official document from the Union ministry of health and family welfare.
