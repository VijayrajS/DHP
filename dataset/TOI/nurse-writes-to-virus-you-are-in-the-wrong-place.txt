Nurse writes to virus: You are in the wrong place
2020-03-30
KOTTAYAM: “My dear friend, you don’t know. This is Kerala. Within one week I will overpower you and leave this room,” writes the nurse at Government Medical College Hospital who was tested positive for Covid-19. Her message posted in a WhatsApp group is addressed to the coronavirus. Apart from her, there are another 20 nurses in the group who have been placed under observation after coming into contact with her.

In an inspirational post, the nurse who got infected while coming into contact with the Ranni-based couple who tested positive for Covid-19, ‘sympathises’ with the virus over its destined defeat in Kerala, which boasts of a resilient and robust healthcare system.

"You don’t know about the people of Kerala and the health workers here. They will make you fall asleep singing a lullaby. You have come to the wrong place,” she says.

She begins the post “Uninvited friend who came”, by elaborating on the disappointment that the ‘friend’ had to face when it found out its plans were going awry. The virus had thought that it could lock her up inside a room and then go on to meet other people. “But I blocked that plan nicely,” she says.

The friend had a misconception that people can be scared away. Instead, the people around me started to take care of me and pray for me. Though my friend, you tried to make me feel depressed, my colleagues, senior staff, doctors, nursing officers and the government have been whole heartedly supporting me. This gives me the strength to fight you alone in this room, she says in her post.
