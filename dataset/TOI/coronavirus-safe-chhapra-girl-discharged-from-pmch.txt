PATNA: A 29-year-old woman from Chhapra, who was kept in the isolation ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), was discharged from the hospital on Thursday after test reports showed that she was not suffering from the Novel coronavirus (nCoV).


The researcher, who had arrived from China recently, was brought to PMCH on Monday after reporting symptoms of cold and breathlessness — signs associated with the deadly virus which has China in its grips and is spreading fast across Southeast Asia. 

Her nose, throat swabs and blood sample were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for nCoV test as well as to Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna for influenza A and B tests, both of which came negative.

State surveillance officer Ragini Mishra, who is the nodal officer for nCoV, said, “We received the report from NIV this morning. The report states that the girl’s pathological samples have tested negative for CoV. A copy was been mailed to the PMCH superintendent to release her. Even the report from RMRI, which we got earlier, was negative, which means she was suffering from a common viral infection.”

The woman, a research scholar at Tianjin in China, had reached Kolkata on January 22 and the next day she arrived at her native place in Chhapra. She was kept overnight at the district hospital on Sunday, after one of her family members informed the state health society about symptoms similar to those of nCoV. Next day she was brought to PMCH.

“I had been saying since the beginning that I was completely fine, however, the officials were doing their duty and I will cooperate with them,” she told TOI on Thursday.

The health department was also keeping a tab on a 22-year-old Sitamarhi resident who had reached Danapur in Patna via Kolkata on January 19 from Wuhan in China. On Tuesday he left for Sitamarhi.
