RU asks for more time to utilise funds citing Covid
2020-05-05
Jaipur: Rajasthan University has written to the various funding agencies to extend the date to utilize the funds till September 2020. As per norms, the university has to utilize funds till March but due to the lockdown they were unable to do so.

The university has written to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for requesting the same and has asked its faculty members to give information about the individual funding they are getting from any agencies. 

University vice chancellor RK Kothari said, “Most of the funds have to be utilized in one financial year. Due to the lockdown, we were unable to process it till March so I have written to the agencies to provide us more time. I have also asked faculty members to give information about their fundings that were supposed to be over by March. Fundings that are continuous will have no problem.” 

However, sources in the university have questioned the reason for non-utilization of the funds. A professor from the university on condition of anonymity said, “Lockdown was imposed in March end, what was the university doing till then? Were they waiting for the end of the month to properly utilize the funds? These are just ways to hide the incompetence of the administration of the university. There have been incidents in the past where funding agencies have stopped the grant as they did not utilize it properly.”

The university administration however says that it is not the entire amount but a certain portion of the amount which wasn’t utilized.
