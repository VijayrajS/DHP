Kolkata: Demand rises, hotels assign more quarantine rooms
2020-04-24
KOLKATA: In the past fortnight, over a half a dozen doctors have checked into hotels that have been temporarily turned into paid quarantine centres. With an entire lot of health workers requiring to be quarantined every time a patient or a healthcare worker at a hospital tests positive, an increasing number of doctors are checking into hotels. Consequently, the room count available for quarantine has also shot up from 645 to 2,000 in the past 10 days.

Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) had arranged paid quarantine facilities in the city from March 27 following request from health and tourism departments. HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar told TOI that doctors who checked in are happy with the facilities. “Some doctors have also checked out after staying for 14 days and they have referred hotels to others,” Poddar added. 

According to him, though HRAEI started the facility from Kolkata, it now has paid quarantine facilities all over the state, including in Siliguri, Asansol, Kalimpong, Darjeeling, Midnapore, Durgapur, Purulia and Burdwan. The number of people checked in so far has crossed 200.

HRAEI had initially arranged 400 rooms for isolation in Kolkata in March. The initial response was lukewarm, but after the spread of Covid-19, the demand has gained momentum. FHRAI former national president T S Walia said almost 50-60 people have already completed the isolation term in hotel rooms.

The charges for rooms range from Rs 2,500-Rs 5,000 per day, depending on hotel categories. The package includes everything, like breakfast, lunch and dinner. Some of the hotels are offering different cuisines for the boarders. Currently, there are 2,500-2,600 rooms in five-star and five-star deluxe categories in the city and more than 2,000 in the three-four-star categories. Besides, there are 15,000 rooms in the non-star category in the city and its surrounding areas.
