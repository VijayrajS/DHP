LUCKNOW: From an eatery selling samosa to a youth organising a get-together outside a mall, someone violated the lockdown every fourth hour in the city over the past 30 days since March 25, shows police data.

In fact, 63 vehicles were penalised every hour under the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act and a vehicle was seized every 90 minutes for violation.

According to official figures, 240 FIRs for lockdown violations were lodged by police from March 25 to April 29. Most were booked for disobeying government orders and putting the life of others in danger by an act that could spread infection. 

During the same period, 54,687 vehicles were booked and 584 seized. The vehicle drivers were challaned for violations like driving without helmet/seat belt and without licence, among other offences. “We warn and let go most violators and book only those who show complete disregard,” said a senior officer. Commissioner of police Sujeet Pandey said, “We expect that not even a single vehicle is visible on the roads, some places have done well but some need to be improved.”
