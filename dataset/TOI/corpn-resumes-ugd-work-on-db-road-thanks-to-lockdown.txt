Corpn resumes UGD work on DB Road, thanks to lockdown
2020-04-14
Coimbatore: With roads free of traffic, the city corporation has resumed its underground drainage (UGD) work on DB Road, which used to be one of the most congested roads.

The civic body has been carrying out UGD pipe laying work using minimal manpower and the work is expected to be completed in a week, corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar said. “We took the decision after discussing the pros and cons. On a normal day, digging the road and laying pipeline is not just time-consuming but also cause inconvenience to people. That’s why we decided to do the work now, when the road is empty due to the lockdown. We will be able to complete the work in a short span of time without causing inconvenience to public,” he said.

UGD pipes are laid on the centre of the lane while most of the telecom and power cables are on the edge of the road, Kumar said. “To be on the safer side, we sought the assistance of the government departments concerned. The electricity board and BSNL deployed their teams at the site to carry out repairs if cables were damaged during the work”.”

In the last two days, the workers accidentally damaged two telecom cables, which were restored immediately. “After the lockdown was imposed, telecom companies are operating with minimal workforce to carry out maintenance. If any of the main cables are damaged, it would be very difficult to mobilise the workforce and restore the connection,” said a source privy to the project.
