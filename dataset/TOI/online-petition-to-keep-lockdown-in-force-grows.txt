Goa: Online petition to keep lockdown in force grows
2020-03-27
PANAJI: While chief minister Pramod Sawant, responding to public demand, announced the opening of provisional stores from Friday, there was an angry reaction from several quarters who say that it would invite trouble for the state in a big way.


A letter petition is also being circulated on social media for citizens to sign in favour of continuing with the complete 21-day lockdown.

Noted singer Hema Sardesai and former Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr Shekhar Salkar who are among those in the forefront demanding reversal of the decision, said that the government cannot take a risk considering that three people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the state. They have appealed to the chief minister to reconsider his decision in the interest of the health of the citizens of Goa.

“The medical fraternity will be with you on this. There must be 100% lockdown and people will support this,” Salkar said on Thursday.
