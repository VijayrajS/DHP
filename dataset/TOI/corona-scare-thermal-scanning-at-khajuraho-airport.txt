2020-03-10
BHOPAL: In a bid to cope with the coronavirus scare, Khajuraho airport has started thermal scanning of tourists. Apart from scanning, travel history of tourists is also being recorded. 


Though the number of foreign tourists to Khajuraho has dropped sharply, it still continues to be the highest in the state. On Monday, two flights that landed at Khajuraho airport brought just 75 foreign tourists as compared to around 300 on normal days, airport sources said. 

Director of Khajuraho airport PK Bej told TOI, “The state government has deputed doctor at the airport along with the thermal scanning machine to check the body temperature of tourists. We are also recording the travel history of tourists. Based on the report, we are taking action.” 

Owing to the coronavirus scare, the number of tourists reaching Khajuraho has dropped considerably, especially in the last few days. Mahendra Sharma, an office-bearer of the hotel owners association in Khajuraho said, “A large number of bookings have been cancelled as the government has decided to cancel the visa of tourists some European nations, like Italy. Just 5% to 10% tourism is left at the moment in Khajuraho and Orchha. There was a good flow of Chinese tourists to Khajuraho before the outbreak of COVID, but almost all the bookings have been cancelled.
