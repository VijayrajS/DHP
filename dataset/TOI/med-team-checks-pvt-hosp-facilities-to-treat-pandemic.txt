Trichy: With many affluent people preferring private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment, a medical team constituted by the district administration has kicked off the process of inspecting facilities available at a private medical college hospital. A team led by Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) dean Dr K Vanitha inspected Trichy SRM medical college hospital and research centre on Wednesday in this regard. She was accompanied by deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr A Subramani and joint direct of health services (JDHS) Dr R Lakshmi. The team found 200 beds kept ready for Covid-19 treatment at the hospital. “The hospital reserved 10 beds in intensive care unit (ICU) and another 10 beds for semi-ICU while the rest of the beds have been allotted for general ward,” Dr Vanitha told TOI. She added that many well-off people have been treated in government hospitals for Covid.It may be noted that the state health and family welfare department had fixed treatment costs for Covid-19 patients at Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000 a day depending on admission to the general ward or ICU. The hospitals have to follow the fee structure failing which they will have to face legal action. According to collector S Sivarasu, Covid-19 patients were being treated at Kauvery hospital in Trichy. As of Wednesday, three patients were under treatment at the hospital. Since the peak of the pandemic outbreak in March this year, MGMGH has been playing a vital role in treating patients from Trichy, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Karur, Pudukottai districts. The hospital has treated 105 patients from Trichy district alone so far besides curing several patients from the neighbouring districts.
