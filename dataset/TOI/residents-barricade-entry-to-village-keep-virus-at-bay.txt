Udhagamandalam: Setting an example for the rest of us in the fight against the coronavirus, residents of Bakkorai village in Kundha taluk here have decided neither to go out of the village nor let outsiders in.

“We held a meeting with the residents and decided not to go out of the village till April 14 as prescribed by the government,” a villager told TOI. “We will not allow relatives or other people enter the village. This will make the 80 families here live fear free.”

The villagers have installed a board at the entrance stating that outsiders are not welcome. They have also blocked the entrance using sandbags.

Outsiders who want to enter the village must produce doctor’s certificate, said B Bhojan, a resident. “We have cancelled all the proposed functions and festivals till April 14. We will strictly follow the rules imposed on us by us.”
