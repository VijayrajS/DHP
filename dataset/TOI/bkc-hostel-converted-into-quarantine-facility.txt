Nashik: The MET Bhujbal Knowledge City (BKC) studentsâ€™ hostel has been converted into a quarantine facility for police personnel and their families who may have come in contact with Covid-19 patients. 

The hostel was made available by former MP Sameer Bhujbal on the instructions of Chhagan Bhujbal. There are a total of 75 flats in the hostel. It can accommodate 350 police personnel and their family members. 

The police are doing their duty around-the-clock to prevent the spread of Covid 19. 

Superintendent of police,Nashik rural police, Arti Singh had approached the MET Bhujbal Knowledge City at Adgaon for getting a part of the premises where police personnel can get their medical check-up done. She also requested that the hostel which is close to the headquarters of rural police be turned into quarantine facility. 

SP Arti Singh said that scores of police personnel are working in the containment areas of Malegaon to ensure that lockdown is followed by everyone and people do not venture out of their houses.

Some policemen who have contracted the infection have been hospitalised. However, police personnel who have come in contact with such patients should get their medical check-up done and should be quarantined for a period of 14 days. Therefore, the new facility will ensure that policemen, who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients but do not show any symptoms, can be quarantined there.
