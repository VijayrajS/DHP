Combating Covid-19: Chenchu tribe taps nature to make masks
2020-05-10
HYDERABAD: Chenchu tribes of Nallamalla forest are combating Covid-19 using the resources available to them. At a time when governments are struggling to reach out to some tribal hamlets located deep inside the forest, the Chenchus have made personal protective equipment such as face masks from leaves of teak and sal trees. 


Further, they are also not stepping out from their hamlets, except to collect forest produce once or twice a week. 

“We had seen tribal development officials using cloth mask when we visited the Girijana Cooperative Corporation (GCC) to collect ration a few days ago. After we were informed by them about the virus and how it spreads, we decided to use leaves to protect ourselves,” Nimmala Lingayya, a resident of Mallapur Chenchu penta (hamlet), told TOI. 

The tribals are also ensuring that there was no gathering at hamlets, while some of them stand guard to let no outsider intrude their territory. 

“The Chenchus have been proactive in taking precautionary measures without waiting for government initiatives. They are making face masks using leaves and a few herbal medicines with the limited resources available in the forest. They are also not stepping out from their hamlets except to collect forest produce occasionally,” an Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) official told TOI. Located 150 kilometres from Hyderabad, nearly 137 Chenchu hamlets dot the Nallamalla forest. 

When contacted, Dr Ramana Prasad, consultant pulmonologist at KIMS Hospitals said, “Anything that covers your mouth and nose can be used as a mask to prevent transmission of the virus in the community. So, even a leaf, which can act as a shield to stop the droplets that are produced as a result of coughing or sneezing, can be used as a mask.” 

“However, the leaf masks should not cause breathing difficulty and, if the mask is not of a porous material, there is a risk of CO2 retention,” he added.
