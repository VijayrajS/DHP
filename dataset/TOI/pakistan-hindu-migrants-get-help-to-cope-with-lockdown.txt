2020-04-02
JODHPUR: Volunteers associated with the Seemant Lok Sangathan and Universal Just Action Society (UJAS), working for the welfare and rights of the Pak Hindu migrants, have begun raising funds for providing foodgrain packets to migrant families settled in Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Barmer and other districts like Jaipur, Jalore, Sirohi and Pali. 


Sustaining on daily-wage jobs like agriculture, stone quarries, handicraft industry, scrap dealing and masonry, these distraught migrants have been hit hard as they lost their jobs due to coronavirus-induced lockdown. 

Unfortunately, these migrants most of whom are not Indian citizens have not been counted in the relief announced by the state government recently for BPL category as well as the other vulnerable groups covered under social security schemes and two months’ foodgrains for the marginalized families covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA).

“We have pleaded the state government to cover these migrant families under these benefits during this testing time as they are also in need of support,” said Hindu Singh Sodha, president of the Seemant Lok Sangathan. He said that over 6,000 migrant families across the state, which include both non-citizens and few citizens but not yet included under any social security scheme, who have been suffering under the lockdown and they have nowhere to go or no one to look to. 

“So, we have started raising funds at the rate of Rs 360 per kit per family and have been distributing it at their settlements making sure that no protocol is violated and no rules related to lockdown broken,” said Ashok Suthar, associated with UJAS.
