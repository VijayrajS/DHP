JAMSHEDPUR: A Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP-5) constable, posted on Covid-19 duty at Ghodabanda police station, on Saturday fired four shots at himself from his service weapon (AK-47) in a bid to kill himself, allegedly over a family dispute. Puran Chandra Munda is currently at TMH and his condition is critical, police said.


Officer-in-charge of Ghodabanda police station B R Oraon said, “Puran fired four bullets at himself, of which three bullets hit his chest while the fourth one hit another part of his body.” He added, “Our preliminary investigation indicates that Puran was upset because of some family issue.”

Puran stayed at the police barrack while his family stayed in Chakulia. His daughter is currently stranded in Kota, where she’s studying in a coaching centre for MBBS aspirants, because of the ongoing lockdown.
