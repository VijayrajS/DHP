Coronavirus in Kochi: Demand for sanitizers, infrared thermometers up
2020-03-12
KOCHI: As Covid-19 fear grips the city, there is high demand for handheld infrared (IR) thermometers (non-contact thermometers).


Druggists said many companies, mostly those from the Infopark, are placing orders for infrared thermometers and there is not enough stock to meet the requirements. Even though new orders have been placed, the high demand across the world has affected the supply and production of these devices, said druggists.

Incidentally, till about Monday, there was a little demand for infrared-thermometers, with medical shops selling about one or two in a week. But suddenly that has changed and the demand for infrared-thermometers, masks, sanitizers and gloves has grown by almost 70% to 75%. Due to this, many medical shops at present don’t have these items in stock.

“Infrared thermometer permits temperature measurement from a distance without contact with the object to be measured using infrared rays. In the wake of Covid-19, people prefer these devices over conventional thermometers. We have received so many calls from IT companies to place orders for the devices but there in not enough stock, as these devices don’t have much demand normally,” said Aslam K A, a staff of a medical store.

With the state government having issued Covid-19 Standard Operational Procedure to IT parks that suggests health screening of visitors and suspected employees, many companies are using IR thermometers.

 “In the past few days, nearly 10 to 20 lakh masks have been sold in the state. This is mainly because many Malayalis, who are travelling abroad, are carrying two to three boxes of masks as there is shortage abroad,” said P V Tomy, president, Chemist and Druggist Association, Ernakulam.
