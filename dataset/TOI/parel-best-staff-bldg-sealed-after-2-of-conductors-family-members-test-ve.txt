MUMBAI: A BEST staff quarters in Parel that houses 60 families was sealed by the BMC on Tuesday after a bus conductor’s daughter and granddaughter tested positive for Covid-19. 


The conductor’s entire family has been quarantined and their swab samples have been sent for tests. A bus driver who would accompany the conductor regularly has been quarantined as well. 

BEST drivers and conductors are frontline workers during the Covid-19 crisis and ferry essential staff from far-flung suburbs to the city.

It is learnt that the conductor’s married daughter has a residence in another locality in Parel. Her husband had recently tested positive for Covid-19 and had high fever. He was admitted to a hospital while his wife was asked to home-quarantine herself. Instead of heeding the directions, she moved in with her parents in the BEST staff quarters taking her three-year-old daughter along. Both have tested positive, said a BEST official. The conductor’s aged mother, wife and son have submitted swab samples for testing, the results of which are awaited. 

“A few of the conductor’s colleagues have come forward too, saying they want to get tested voluntarily,” said Nitin Patil, president of BEST Employees’ Union. 

Patil, who is in touch with drivers and conductors and their families at the Parel staff quarters, said more than 200 people, including family members of staffers, are now under quarantine. BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade said the BMC has sprayed disinfectants in the area. 

While the staff quarters has several buildings, only one where the conductor lives has been sealed. 

Shashank Rao of BEST Workers’ Union said conductors come in contact with several people during work. “We are awaiting his report.”

The unions had asked the management to reduce drivers and conductors and give them alternate shift duties. 

“They should ideally take samples of every driver and conductor at day’s end and send these to the labs. If anyone is found positive, he should not be asked to report to duty the next day,” said Patil. A BEST foreman from the electricity supply division was found positive on April 3. 

Union leader J M Kahar said social distancing is not maintained at depots and in buses. A senior traffic wing official said they are serious about maintaining social distancing in buses.“We will ensure there are no standees in buses henceforth.”
