2020-04-27
CHANDIGARH: Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said on Sunday the nationwide lockdown implemented in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak will have to be lifted in a phased manner and added that no state is in favour of complete lifting of the curfew. He also ruled out allowing sale of liquor in the state before May 3.


Dushyant said Haryana has done better arrangements as compared to the other states to deal with the pandemic, due to which the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in the state is better than the national average. As far as opening of liquor shops is concerned, he said, those would remain completely closed till May 3. In crisis, state governments should not only think about revenue but also cooperate with the central government, he said.

He said in compliance with guidelines issued by Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), an initiative has been taken to bring industrial and economic activities in the state to normalcy in a phased manner, and online applications have been invited from industries to help them resume their operations.
