Coronavirus hits Nepal, Gorakhpur is vulnerable
2020-01-27
Gorakhpur: The first case of deadly coronavirus reported from Nepal has led to concerns in eastern UP, especially Gorakhpur, which is close to Indo-Nepal border and many people from the city commute to Nepal daily through Sonouli and Badni border.

Though steps have been initiated for screening of the virus at the airport, experts believe that health check-up along the open border is a must to check its entry in India.

“The virus is deadly and has already claimed lives in many countries. A case has been reported from Nepal too. We share 1751-km long open border with Nepal and checking virus only at the airport and not on borders will be an exercise in futility. Health check-posts should be established at entry points on Indo-Nepal border to check the entry of virus in the country,” Dr RN Singh, campaigner, Mission Save in India, said.

“Checking for virus has already started at airport but open border between the two countries should be monitored,” he said. Singh said during SARS epidemic in 2002-03, they demanded health check-posts along Indo-Nepal border which was accepted by the government.

“Around half-a-dozen cases of coronavirus have been detected in Thailand. Many people from here also go to Thailand and people from the country visit Gorakhpur. Health check-posts are the need of the hour,” he said.

Chief medical officer Srikant Tiwari said an isolation ward would be set up at district hospital.

“As of now, no case of coronavirus has been reported in Gorakhpur but the department is ready to deal with the situation. An isolation ward will be constructed at district hospital soon,” the CMO added.
