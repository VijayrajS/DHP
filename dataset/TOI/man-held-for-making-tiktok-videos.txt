NASHIK: The Nashik rural police have arrested a 40-year-old man from Malegaon for making objectionable coronavirus-related TikTok videos.


After the videos went viral, the police swung into action and arrested the suspect under sections 153 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code.

A senior police officer said in one of the videos, the man was seen wiping his nose with currency notes and he made certain comments that could hurt religious sentiments.

“The cybercrime police swung into action and traced the location from where the post was made,” he said.

“The suspect from Malegaon was arrested on Thursday. He will be produced before the Malegaon court on Friday for getting his police remand,” he added.
