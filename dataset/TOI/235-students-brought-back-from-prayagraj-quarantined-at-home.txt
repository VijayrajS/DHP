BAREILLY: On Thursday, government buses brought 235 students who were struck in Prayagraj back to Kheri. The district administration initially took all the students to a private school in Lakhimpur city, where they were screened by a medical team. 

The students were later directed to download the Aarogya Setu app on their phones and to strictly follow home quarantine norms. They were asked to submit an affidavit that they will follow the guidelines and keep themselves isolated in their room and inform the district control room in case they displayed any Covid-19 like symptoms.

SDM (Sadar) Arun Kumar Singh told TOI, “After providing them breakfast, we completed medical check-up of all the students. Fortunately, all of them seemed to be fine and didn’t display symptoms of any disease during the examination. We made them promise they will stay at home for the 28 day quarantine period and follow guidelines. 

The students will be monitored with the support of government school teachers in their respective areas. The students were advised to download the Aarogya Setu app and follow its instructions. They have been asked to maintain social distancing and inform us immediately if they develop symptoms of any disease.”
