Coronavirus & lockdown cause a drop in district’s crime rate
2020-03-26
Kolhapur: The coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown has led to a reduction in the crime rate in Kolhapur district.

According to the police department, every day, about 12 to 15 cases are registered with the various police stations in the district. However, on Sunday — the day janata curfew was in effect — only three cases were registered. According to police officers, as everyone was staying at home and there was a heavy police presence on the roads, there has been a fall in the district’s crime rate.

Prashant Amrutkar, the deputy superintendent of police, Karveer division, said: “On an average, 12 to 15 criminal incidents are registered with the police in the district. These include thefts, robberies, chain snatchings, murders, attempts to murder and other disputes between families or individuals. Since the coronavirus outbreak, we have noticed that there has been a reduction in the number of cases registered with the police stations.”

“As the coronavirus threat has increased in the state, we are experiencing a reduction in criminal activities in the district. In the past 10 days, the officers from different police stations in our jurisdiction have been saying that fewer criminal activities have been reported in their respective police stations. Incidents like robberies, murders, thefts, attempts to murder and chain snatchings have reduced. Even criminal activities like gambling and matkas have shut. Road accidents have also reduced as there are fewer people on the roads,” he said.

“We suspect the reason is that the people are staying at home and there are low chances of thieves targetting houses. The continuous patrolling of the police has also helped,” he said.
