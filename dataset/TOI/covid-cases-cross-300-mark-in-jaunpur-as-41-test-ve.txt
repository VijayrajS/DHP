Varanasi: Jaunpur became the first district of east UP to cross the 300-mark of Covid-19 cases as 41 more persons were found infected on Tuesday.

A physician of the district hospital in Jaunpur was also among the 41 patients who tested positive.

Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Tuesday, “The total tally of Covid-19 cases in Jaunpur district surged to 326 as 41 new ones were detected. These include 40 migrants and one doctor. As many as 152 patients have been cured till now, while three had died. So, total active cases in the district are 171 now. ”

Over 1,270 test reports received by Jaunpur administration on Tuesday were negative. Most of the infected persons are migrants and belong to rural belts of the district, said officials.

“A physician, who is consultant at Shahganj primary health centre and in district hospital has tested positive,” said chief medical superintendent of Jaunpur district hospital Dr Anil Sharma.

More than 2.34 lakh migrants have returned to Jaunpur from Mumbai, Gujarat, Delhi and NCR, said commissioner. The return of migrants has alarmingly increased the number of Covid-19 cases in Jaunpur in just 25 days.

Covid-19 menace in the district had started with the arrival of Tablighi Jamaat attendees. Till May 17, only 17 infected persons had been found in Jaunpur but, by Tuesday morning the Covid-19 cases crossed the 300- mark. 

The government machinery had already geared up preparations for the treatment of Covid-19 patients as the return of migrants was very high, said the commissioner. The positive aspect is that over 90% cases are in rural belts and have not led to community transmission among locals so far.

A Covid-19 Level-1 hospital with 450 beds has been set up in Jaunpur, while Varanasi has 1,000 beds in L-1, L-2 and L-3 facilities, he said.
