2020-04-19
Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will convert its Samaras Hostel’s quarantine centre into a Covid-19 care centre where it will accommodate asymptomatic patients. It now plans to set up zone-wise quarantine centres across the city. According to SMC commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani, the SMC will start antibody tests from Sunday in Covid-19 hotspots areas of the city. “More cases are being reported from Limbayat zone, especially from Man Darwaja Apartment. We have intensified our community testing and therefore, more Covid-19 positive cases are being reported,” Pani explained. Pani said that as the number of Covid-19 positive cases are on the rise, the number of home quarantine people will also increase. “We request the citizens to download SMC Covid-19 Tracker App for better monitoring of such people and thereby handling the crisis,” he said. The SMC on Saturday issued notices to two private clinics for not updating about patients’ details to the civic body. It also called upon young people to come forward and join as Covid Commandos (volunteers) to help the civic body fight the global pandemic.
