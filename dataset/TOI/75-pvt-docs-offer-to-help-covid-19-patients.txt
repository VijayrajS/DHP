NASHIK: As many as 75 private doctors, including 20 with post-graduate degree in medicine, have come forward to help Malegaon Municipal Corporation in treating Covid-19 patients.


MMC commissioner Kishore Borde told TOI that he had a meeting with these private doctors. “We will use the services of these doctors at the 40-bed Covid-19 hospital that we established recently,” he said.

Sources informed the cash-strapped MMC does not have adequate number of doctors to deal with the pandemic. “The MMC has around 50 doctors and there are another 50 government doctors based in Malegaon. We will need more doctors in case the number of Covid-19 patients starts increasing in Malegaon. These private doctors can work in turns to treat the infected patients,” an MMC official said.
