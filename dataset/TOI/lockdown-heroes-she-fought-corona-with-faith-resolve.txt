CHANDIGARH: Having volunteered for self-quarantine, little did Tammana Jain, a student who returned from UK know that she would test Covid-19 positive. She recovered from the disease in a fortnight. She attributes the speedy recovery to will power, positive thinking, meditation and a fighting spirit. Tammana, who was admitted in Bhagat Phool Singh, PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan Sonipat, also contributed Rs one lakh towards the CM’s Corona relief fund. The 23-year-old student of Masters in Applied Mathematics in the University of Cambridge, UK reached home on March 18 and quarantined herself.


“Initially, I had cough. Without taking any chances, I approached BPS PGIMS and was admitted there. The next day, I tested positive. Certainly, I was sad and disappointed but I was confident of coming out it,” said Tamanna.

While her family members were anxious, they maintained a positive outlook through meditation and the guidance of their spiritual guru, she said, adding that her determination helped her to defeat the disease.

“I was determined to recover and in the very next test I was tested negative. Two more tests were also negative and I was discharged,” she said. Tamanna expressed gratitude towards the consultant physician and those who supported and encouraged her in the isolation ward. Speaking to TOI over phone, Tamanna and her brother Nitin said their friends and neighbours supported them through the ordeal.

“Since our family was quarantined, neighbours were a great help to us. Unlike others in quarantine who are looked upon as untouchable, we had all the support of people in the neighbourhood,” said Nitin.
