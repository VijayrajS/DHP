PUNE: The swab test report of the 25-year-old man, who committed suicide on Thursday jumping from the third-floor of a hospital after he was admitted to its quarantine facility, revealed that he did not suffer from coronavirus infection.


Senior inspector B J Misal of the Khadki police said, “He tested negative for the virus. We received the report on Friday afternoon.”

The man, a resident of Khadki, was shifted to the quarantine facility of the hospital on Thursday morning and his swab was collected for test. His brother and sister were also admitted to the facility. Their swabs, too, were collected.

Police said the Khadki man was under tremendous stress and panicked when he was taken to the quarantine facility of the hospital. 

On Thursday night, he left his hospital bed stating that he wanted to go to the washroom. 

Instead of going to the toilet, he went to the third floor of the hospital. He then jumped off from the open corridor around 9pm. 

Misal said it was a case of suicide. The police have registered an accidental death case.
