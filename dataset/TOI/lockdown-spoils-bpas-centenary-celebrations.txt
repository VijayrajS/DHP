PATNA: The lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic spoiled the Bihar Police Association’s plans to celebrate its centenary celebrations on a grand scale on Wednesday.

The association had planned to invite Union home minister Amit Shah, CM Nitish Kumar and several others, its president Mrityunjay Kumar Singh said. The invitation had been sent to Shah, but all plans got cancelled.

“We had planned to spend Rs15-20 lakh on the programme during which several police officers and civilians were to be awarded for their exemplary works. Instead, we celebrated it just by lighting candles in the presence of only a few of our officers and office-bearers at the association’s office,” Singh said.

He said only Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha had police associations formed in British era. “A meeting of lower-rank police officers was held in Howrah on May 20, 1920 when the British India Police Association was formed,” he said.

He said police associations in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha were originally the parts of British India Police Association official recognized by the British in 1924, but got separated over a period of time with police in Odisha detached from the command of Bengal presidency and then separation of Bihar and Jharkhand in 2000,” he said.

Singh said the Bihar association with 20,000 members gives financial assistance of Rs9,000 each per semester to two children of its members for graduation. “We also give assistance of Rs5,000 to Rs50,000 to our members in any medical emergency,” he said, adding the association also donated Rs1.8 crore to CM Relief Fund for Covid-19 recently.

Singh said the association of Railway Protection Force is the only police association to get recognition in independent India during AB Vajpayee’s regime. “West Bengal police association was banned by its government and the matter is sub judice,” he said.
