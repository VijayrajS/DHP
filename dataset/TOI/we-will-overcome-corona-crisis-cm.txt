2020-04-25
GANDHINAGAR: Even as fear is being expressed that the Covid-19 outbreak in the state is spiralling out of control, chief minister Vijay Rupani issued a video statement on Friday to assure people that the state will soon overcome the crisis.


Rupani said that although the need may not arise, the administration is readying 25,000-bed capacity for Covid-19 patients.

“Many are questioning whether we will be able to manage the crisis if it worsens further,” the CM said. “The state had created 9,500-bed capacity by March 20 itself. Today, we have about 2,500 Covid-19 patients and a capacity of 9,500 beds.” He went on to say: “In Ahmedabad alone, we have a capacity of over 5,000 beds and a Covid care centre (CCC) at Samras hostel with a capacity of 2,000 beds.”

Rupani said that the state government is in the process of doubling bed capacity for Covid-19 patients even if the need does not arise. “Preparations are on to have a 25,000-bed capacity for Covid-19 patients. The state government is also not facing any shortage of ventilators,” he said.

The CM said that many ask why the government has allowed private hospitals to treat coronavirus patients. “We have declared that treatment of all patients in government hospitals will be totally free,” he said. “We allowed private hospitals to treat patients so that people have an option.”

Commenting on the video of Ahmedabad Civil hospital which went viral on social media, the CM said that all issues faced by patients are being resolved.
