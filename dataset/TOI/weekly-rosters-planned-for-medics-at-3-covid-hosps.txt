KOLKATA: Six state-run hospitals are preparing weekly rosters for the medical teams that will be deputed at three hospitals designated for Covid-19 treatment. Each team will comprise 10 doctors from five specialties – general medicine, paediatric medicine, chest, microbiology, ENT and psychiatry. 


Currently, the ID Hospital Beliaghata, MR Bangur Hospital and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute’s second campus at New Town are the three Covid-19 hospitals, where the medical teams will be utilized for both in-patient and OPD services. Besides, a doctor and a faculty members from School of Tropical Medicine Kolkata will also be posted at the ID Hospital for a week.

While NRS Medical College and Hospital and RG Kar Hospital have been assigned to send teams to the ID Hospital, SSKM Hospital and Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital will send teams to MR Bangur Hospital. Medical College Kolkata and College of Medicine and Sagar Dutta Hospital will do the same for CNCI.

“The medical team will have a faculty member and a post graduate trainee from each specialty. We have been sending medical teams regularly to the Covid hospitals. But this new notification is meant to streamline the process of seven-day work and seven-day off for the doctors,” said an official at NRS Hospital. For example, a team from NRS will be deputed at the ID Hospital for a week while another team from RG Kar will be on duty the next week.
