Dumka: Family members of a 22-year-old youth, who died here on Thursday night, have been home quarantined and will undergo Covid-19 tests, authorities said on Saturday. Dumka civil surgeon Dr A K Jha said though the deceased did not have any symptoms of Covid-19, four members of his family have been quarantined and their samples, along with that of the deceased, sent for tests as a precautionary measure.

Jha said, “The youth, from Angraidih village, had returned from Gujarat a month ago and was advised 14-day home quarantine. He showed no signs of infection, but after his sudden death, we are are not taking any chances and retesting all of them.”

He added that the youth had died by the time he was taken to Dumka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) on Thursday night. “It could also be a case of liquor death as we learnt that he consumed countrymade liquor the previous night,” Jha added. 

District health department officials, in the meantime, rued the delay in getting reports from PMCH in Dhanbad. DMCH superintendent Dr Ravindra Kumar said, “We are awaiting reports of 17 samples sent to PMCH six days ago. We have also sent 10 more samples on Friday. We are in a fix due to the delay and facing problems in taking follow-up actions.”
