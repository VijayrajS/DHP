HYDERABAD: An 11-member group from Hyderabad, which was on a pilgrimage to Iraq and Iran and stranded in Mashhad city of Iran due to cancellation of flights to India in the wake of coronavirus scare, has appealed to Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar to help them return. 


Asma Fatima of Darulshifa, in a video message to Jaishankar, said they had gone to Iraq first and then to Iran eight days ago. But, they are unable to return to Hyderabad as flights have been cancelled. They are supposed to return on Saturday but they were informed four days ago that they would not be able to travel. Asma mentioned about medical aid for a person in the group as they had run out of medicines.

The family members contacted the Indian embassy in Iraq. “They were advised by the embassy to travel to capital Tehran. But, they do not have the money or resources to go there,” Syed Mujtaba Hussain, a relative of Asma, told TOI on Friday. He urged the government to bring the families back in a special flight. 

Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and IT minister KT Rama Rao to bring the families back. The group consists of Anwar Jahan, Tahera Begum, Syeda Tehniyath Fathima, Nargis Fathima, Pakeeza Fathima, Mohammed Qashim Ali, Syed Hyder Hussain, Aliya Fathima, Syed Rehanuddin Hyder and Juveria Fathima along with Asma.
