MEERUT: Mohit Rana, a youth in his 20s, who had last month shared a video of panchayat secretary, pradhan pati (husband of village pradhan) and a few others holding a booze party in Hapur during Covid-19 lockdown, was shot at by unidentified miscreants on Saturday afternoon.

Police have now begun probe on the lines of retribution by people irked by video uploaded on Twitter. "As of now, the video episode is the only plausible motive behind the attack," police said. 

According to investigating sleuths, Rana was on his way back home from a field when unidentified assailants shot at him. A bullet struck Rana in the abdomen and he is currently under medical observation at district hospital.

On April 24, Rana, resident of Sapnawat village, uploaded an 18-second video claiming that instead of helping the poor in their area during lockdown, panchayat secretary and others were "busy partying".

Sushil Kumar, panchayat secretary, landed in a soup after the video of Kumar along with Satendra Singh, pradhan pati, and three others in the liquor party surfaced on Twitter. 

Senior administrative officials had taken cognizance of the video and panchayat secretary Kumar was suspended after the probe on April 26.

Meanwhile, police claimed that family of the victim have complained against pradhant pati Satendra Singh for carrying out the attack following which he was detained for questioning. 

"We are looking at all possible angles. Pradhan pati Satendra Singh was also at the spot. There is a possibility he could have hired someone to carry out the attack. The family is pinning the blame on Singh. We have detained him to interrogate further," Sarvesh Mishra, additional superintendent of police (Hapur) said.
