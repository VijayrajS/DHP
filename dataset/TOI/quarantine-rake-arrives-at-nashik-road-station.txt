The officials said that the rakes were being moved across all the major railways' stations in the central railways' jurisdiction for any timely requirement of the facilities. 

“There is no specific demand as such, but the railways have prepared such rakes and dispatching them at the various locations so that they can be made available at the short notice wherever required. Across the country the rakes are being sent to the divisional (revenue) headquarters and even the division (railway) headquarters from where they can be diverted, called, sent to the locations required easily,” the officer said on the condition of anonymity.

The coaches have facilities to run electrical (medical) equipment if and when required and hence will be a good support to the health department in tackling the challenge was thrown by Covid-19.

The platform number 4 at Nashik Road station has the water hose facility that will help the coaches to be refilled besides a vast open space outside enabling the easier movement of vehicles. The platform also has no offices which could be affected thereby hampering the railways' parcel or other regular activities that are being carried out.
