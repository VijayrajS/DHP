Lockdown to hit JMC revenue collection
2020-03-24
Jaipur: The lockdown will have adverse effect on Jaipur Municipal Corporation’s revenue collection this year. According to civic body officials, most of the revenue is collected in March-end, which is now being stopped due to the lockdown. 

To save revenue losses, JMC officials are demanding that the government must extend the financial year from March 30 to April 30. JMC sources said a letter had been sent to the government, but no decision had been made as yet. 

Officials were able to collect around Rs 70 crore of urban development tax before the lockdown. Around Rs 20 crore tax is usually collected at the end of March as urban development tax and marriage garden license fees.

Deputy commissioner (Revenue) Naveen Bhardhwaj said, “Our regular depositors usually deposit tax in the end. We have identified some new properties that were taxable, but none of owners has deposited it. With restrictions on outsiders in JMC, it will be impossible for them to do anything. This will take a toll on revenue collection this year.”

Marriage garden license fees was increased from Rs 10 per sq-metre to Rs 20 per sq-metre. This was challenged by the marriage garden association to higher authorities. Till the matter was solved, owners were paying Rs 10 per sq-metre rates. The matter was finally resolved after two years as the government refused to lower the rates. Now marriage garden owners were supposed to pay higher price due for the last two years along with the penalty of Rs 100 per day. 

However, the government gave them relief by letting them pay fees without penalty if marriage garden owners submit fees before March 30. JMC was organising camps for marriage garden fees deposit from March 23, but that had been cancelled due to coronavirus.
