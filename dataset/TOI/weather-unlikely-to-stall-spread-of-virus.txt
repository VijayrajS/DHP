Weather unlikely to stall spread of virus
2020-03-05
NEW DELHI: Some experts believe that the spread of coronavirus may be slowed down under hot weather conditions, but the forecast till March 12 doesn’t throw up any relief on that front as there is no prediction of any increase in temperature in the next few days.


Though seasonal forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD) for March-April-May talks of “warmer than normal” temperature over northwest, west, central and parts of south India, it predicts “below normal (2-5°Celsius in general) maximum day temperatures” over major parts of the Indian mainland during the March 6-12 period.

In its weekly update, released on February 27, the IMD had, however, predicted that while temperatures would be “above normal” (by 2-3°Celsius) on March 5 in the north and parts of south India, it would be “below normal” (3-4 degree Celsius) in the rest of the country including central and northeast India.

There is even a prediction of fairly widespread rainfall over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and UP during March 5-7 period. Most parts of central and east India (Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal) too may have similar conditions during the period — it means there is low possibility of a rise in temperatures there in next two days. More clarity on the trajectory of temperature rise will be available in the next update on Thursday.
