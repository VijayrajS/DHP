2020-03-19
GUWAHATI: An Assam native who had been quarantined in a Kerala hotel after he showed Covid-19 symptoms fled along with two others — one from Odisha and the other from West Bengal — on March 16 and is suspected to be travelling to the state by train.

“We were informed by Kerala Police today that three people fled a quarantine facility there. One of them happens to be from Lahorighat in Morigaon district,” Morigaon SP Swapnaneel Deka told TOI on Wednesday. “We are tracking his mobile phone, based on which we believe he is on a train to Assam.” When the police last traced his mobile tower location, he was “somewhere in West Bengal”. All railway stations along the route to Assam have been alerted to keep an eye out for anyone matching the person’s description. “We have alerted Government Railway Police and hope to isolate him soon,” Deka said.

It isn’t known if the Assam native who fled Kerala is employed there or has a history of travel to any of the countries affected by the pandemic. “As of now, we only know where his home is,” a police official said. “We don’t have any information about his test result either.” 

Assam is among the states that have so far not reported any confirmed case of novel coronavirus. A man with Covid-19 symptoms was on Wednesday shifted from a hospital at Mirza in Kamrup district to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.

In Dhemaji district, a South Korean visiting the state since March 11 on a business trip has been quarantined in a hotel since Wednesday.
