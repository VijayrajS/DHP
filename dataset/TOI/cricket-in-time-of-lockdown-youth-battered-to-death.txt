Lucknow: A cricket match at a Hardoi hamlet in violation of lockdown norms left a trail of blood after one of the players was battered to death by three rival team members following a brawl over the scoreline. Brajkishore, 22, who was critically injured after being clobbered with a wooden bat and stumps on the pitch, died at the district hospital in Baghauli late Monday. The three accused, Dharmendra, Pankaj and Nagendra were booked for culpable homicide, not amounting to murder on Tuesday.

Circle officer, Baghauli police station, Akhilesh Rajan said, the match on Sunday evening between neighbouring hamlets, Semrakalan and Semrakhurd, turned ugly after a batsman, Brajkishore, was accused of fudging runs, triggering a violent backlash from the rival team.

“We have registered a case of culpable homicide, not amounting to murder and voluntarily causing hurt, against the trio,” said the officer. He also said players of both teams and villagers will also be booked for violation of lockdown. “We are preparing a report and a separate FIR will be lodged,” said Rajan.
