PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the government plans to rope in more laboratories to increase testing facilities. 




At present, 6,500 tests are done in a day at 38 government and private laboratories. In Pune, nearly 500 tests are being done at seven laboratories. As many as 750 samples were tested in Pune on Wednesday. 

The state is awaiting approvals for more private laboratories from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for testing. “We want to ramp up our testing facilities and more private laboratories will seek approval for conducting these tests,” the minister said.

At present, all these government laboratories are operating to 90% of their capacity, director of Maharashtra Health Services, Satish Pawar, said. 

All civic bodies are conducting surveillance and sending swab samples of those approaching the flu clinics set up in the red zone areas of Pune and Mumbai. 

“As of now, both private and government laboratories are working to full capacity. We do not know the number of proposals with ICMR. If more private laboratories come in, it would help ramp up the facilities,” state health department director Archana Patil said.

The state had tested 83,111 samples till Tuesday. The ICMR has told the state to hold on to rapid testing for two days, Patil said. With over 400 active containment zones, there are a total of 6,611 surveillance squads working across the state and over 26 lakh have been screened.

Assessing the volume of tests, health expert Raju Jotkar said till date the country has undertaken 170 tests per million population, Maharashtra tests about 525 tests per million and Pune revenue division tests 363 per million.

“One has to work out the volume of tests per million specifically and enhance its volume to match the testing volume. The active contact tracing in cluster containment zones (hot spots) as well as fever clinics are expected to fetch new eligible persons for testing. As conceived, the proposed pooled testing is likely bring further efficiency and volume in testing,” he added.

Anant Phadke, co-convenor of Jan Arogya Abhiyan,the tighter lockdown in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad should be accompanied by intensive testing of contacts of Covid-19 patients, including all persons who the doctors feel, based on standard criteria, have the infection.

On Wednesday, the central team in Mumbai told the Maharashtra government to increase the number of people in institutional quarantine facilities by ramping up the bed strength from 1,200 to 2,000 and to conduct more aggressive testing. The team expects a spike in new cases, a health official added.
