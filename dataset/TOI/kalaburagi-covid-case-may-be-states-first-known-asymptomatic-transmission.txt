KALABURAGI: Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) attendee’s 60-year-old spouse contacting Covid-19 despite her husband’s test results showing no signs of infection could be Karnataka’ first case of asymptomatic transmission.


The woman’s throat swab and blood samples confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus on Thursday. Her husband had been to Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi along with 25 others.

Epidemiologists suggest that this a classic case of asymptomatic transmission of the virus as defined by the World Health Organisation. 

Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, PHFI, said, “WHO recently pointed that there is every possibility of a person showing no symptoms capable of transmitting the virus to another.” He said the same might have happened in Kalaburagi case. The man may have been infected but asymptomatic. “If the viral load is very low, its presence will not be shown in the test,” he opined.

However, Dr Prakash Kumar BG, joint director, communicable diseases, health and family welfare, said his department has not come up with any conclusion on this case as yet.

Dr Ramesh, another epidemiologist said the person who returned from Nizamuddin was asymptomatic but has transmitted virus. On asking why was he tested negative, the doctor said his viral load may be less or the test may not be accurate. 

Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, a medical practitioner said this case can be singled out for further study.
