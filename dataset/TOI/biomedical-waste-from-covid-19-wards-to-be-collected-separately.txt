Trichy: Special vehicles have been assigned to collect biomedical waste from the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital, in the wake of a positive Covid-19 case admitted at the hospital on Thursday. The waste will be taken to the common biomedical waste treatment facility in Thanjavur which collects from over 900 hospitals in eight district including Trichy. The facility, operated by Medicare Enviro Systems, operates 13 vehicles to collect biomedical waste daily, of which four vehicles collect waste from Trichy alone. “A dedicated vehicle will be operated to collect biomedical waste generated in the ward where the Covid-19 patient is being treated,” said district environmental engineer R Lakshmi. A 24-year-old man who returned from Dubai was tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. A native of Erode district, he had gone to Dubai seeking a job and reached Trichy airport on March 22. He was taken to the MGM isolation ward after he showed symptoms.“Revised guidelines have been issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on handling biomedical waste involving Covid-19 suspected and confirmed patients,” she said. “All the five government medical colleges in our jurisdiction have been informed about the directives from CPCB that needs to be followed in preserving biomedical waste,” she added. K Velmurugan, manager of Medicare Enviro Systems, said that workers shall be provided with necessary protective equipment to handle such waste. This will include three-layer masks, splash proof aprons/gowns, nitrile gloves, gum boots and safety goggles. “We have asked CPCB to inform us of any Covid-19 positive cases,” said Velmurugan. Priority will be given to incinerate biomedical waste from Covid-19 treatment wards, he added.
