PATNA: Samastipur district authorities on Tuesday ordered a probe into the ‘cultural show’ organised at a quarantine centre under Bibhutipur block of the district on Monday evening. The controversial show, also attended by some outsiders, came to the fore when a video went viral on social media on Tuesday.

Bibhutipur block development officer Uday Kant Mishra said show-cause notice has been issued to the headmaster-cum-incharge of the quarantine centre at Upgraded Middle School, Karrakh, Raj Kishore, for allowing the cultural show in violation of the lockdown norms. 

“Action will be taken on the basis of his reply,” Mishra said, adding that he has already apprised the senior officers of the matter. 

When contacted, Raj said he had no information about any cultural show organised there and sought an impartial probe into the episode.

Sources said the show was organised at the behest of one Lalan Paswan, stated to be the husband of local mukhiya assigned to look after the quarantine centre under Raj Desri panchayat. One Naresh Sada, a member of ‘Ram Leela’ party, was among the 82 migrant workers staying at the centre. Sada, approached by some young inmates, agreed to organize a ‘gala party’ inside the centre. Sources said some local residents also enjoyed the ‘Bhojpuri’ numbers till late in the night. 

Sada, however, said no outsider was allowed inside the centre. “It was organised by the inmates for themselves only,” he told this newspaper over phone.
