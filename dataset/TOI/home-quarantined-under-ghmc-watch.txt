Hyderabad: The GHMC has set up 150 teams for every ward to help track all the passengers who have arrived from abroad. Each team consists of GHMC, police, health and revenue official. “We got a list of passengers from the government. If any passenger, who has been told to be under home quarantine, is found to be flouting the rule, they will be shifted to isolation ward,” said a GHMC official.

However, in some cases either the passenger no longer resides at the address or is again travelling. GHMC officials confirmed that in most circles there were aberrations in address. “The address taken from the passports has been found to be outdated,” said an official on condition of anonymity. 

T Yadaiah, deputy commissioner (Alwal circle) said: “We were told about four passengers in this circle. One address was incorrect and we could not trace the individual. Another said he is on vacation in Kerala. Both came from abroad.”

In Mehdipatnam circle, deputy commissioner MK Ali, said there were three to four similar cases. “We have been asked to track 159 people. A few were not found at stated addresses.” 

In Serilingampally, deputy commissioner Sri Venkanna, said there were 10 such cases. He said, “When we went to one address we found the passenger had shifted long ago to Bhimavaram in AP. But we have been able to trace all the passengers.”

GHMC officials could not confirm what was being done about passengers who were in other states or if their details would be sent to respective authorities to track.
