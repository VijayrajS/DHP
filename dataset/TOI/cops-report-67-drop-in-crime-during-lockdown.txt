Goa: Cops report 67% drop in crime during lockdown
2020-05-10
PANAJI: The coronavirus scare seems to have kept criminals at bay with the police registering on an average three first information report (FIRs) per day across 25 police stations instead of an average of over seven FIRs last year.


Inspector general of police (IGP) Jaspal Singh told TOI that the crime rate has fallen by 67% during the lockdown as compared to the same period last year.

From March 25 to May 4 this year, a total 103 FIRs have been registered in the state, while 316 FIRs had been registered during the same period last year. 

“The reason behind reduction in the crime rate is because of presence of police personnel at every nook and corner of the state and people being indoors due to the lockdown,” he said.

During the last 43 days, most police stations have registered one or two FIRs, except on a few days when around seven to eight FIRs were registered.

A senior police officer said that the thefts, burglaries and robberies have reduced drastically. The officer said that though murder and rape cases have been reported, all have been detected.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced janata curfew on March 22 and since then Goa is under lockdown. 

Apart from crime, fatal accidents have also come down. Earlier a fatal accident was reported every 30 hours in the state. Most of the victims in fatal accidents are youths.

During the initial period of lockdown, the state had witnessed 50% drop in the number of people visiting police stations with various queries. 

A senior police officer said people have started avoiding visiting police stations for police verification, tenant verification, filing complaints, among other matters.
