Telangana doctors complain to IMCT about fewer Covid-19 tests

HYDERABAD: Expressing concern on the fewer number of tests in Telangana for coronavirus, a group of doctors wrote to the inter-ministerial central team (IMCT), but the state government has rubbished these allegations, saying they would not conduct indiscriminate testing.


Dr Santhosh Kraleti, Dr Vijayanand Jamapuri, Dr G Veda Prakash, Dr M Srikanth, Dr M Rajender Reddy and Dr Karuna, on behalf of Doctors for Seva, an NGO comprising doctors and public health specialists highlighted many gaps in the fight against the pandemic, like fewer tests, non-reporting of deaths, isolation wards, and facilities for doctors, which they said would have serious consequences.

“Fewer tests are happening in the state and they are projecting a low total number of cases. Only when more tests are done, we get more positive reports. If we continue to under-test, then we will miss many un-tested positive patients in the community,” the letter reads.

They said so far 19,278 tests were conducted as on April 30, which were 551 tests per million population. Whereas other states like Maharashtra (1,212 per million), Delhi (2,778), Rajasthan (1,417), Tamil Nadu (1,527) and Andhra Pradesh (1,930) had done more. The low caseload of 1,016 in Telangana is very likely due to low testing rates. “Our doubt is that the actual caseload is much higher. We are seriously concerned that once the lockdown is relaxed, the missed patients could cause a surge in a number of cases in Telangana,” the doctors claimed. 

On isolation wards, the doctors said suspected cases and primary contacts are being kept in dormitory or general wards with common toilets. They said pregnant women in containment areas or clusters were not being tested by the government.

But Telangana government has made it clear that it was against indiscriminate tests for Covid-19. Minister KT Rama Rao added the government did not allow private labs as it creates panic and sought to prevent private hospitals from fleecing the public.
