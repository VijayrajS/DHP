Covid-19 scare in Chennai: Korean tenants face ire of landlords, told to vacate houses
2020-03-11
CHENNAI: In a bizarre reaction to Covid-19, some landlords who have leased out their houses and apartments to Korean nationals in the city are asking them to vacate, fearing spread of the virus through their tenants.


Chennai’s community of South Korean nationals, nearly 4,000 strong, is the largest of any country. They live mostly in South Chennai and near the Sriperumbudur corridor.

“We have received some complaints and issues which our people are facing here due to landlords turning restive as they see Korean nationals as those carrying Coronavirus. This is bizarre,” said Hong Yup Lee, deputy consul general for the consulate general of the Republic of Korea.

The consulate has not taken it up with the government as it feels a dialogue with the parties is a better way to deal with the issue than complain. “This is not fair and not when any of them have not visited Korea recently,” he said, adding that they were appalled at the ignorance of the landlords.

“We must see the reality. The rate of detection of Coronavirus in South Korea is dropping sharply with every passing day,” he said.

He said the government of India’s sudden decision to impose travel restrictions to and from South Korea from March 3 has severely impacted business activities.

The Union government suspended visas and e-visas granted to people travelling from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan after a surge in Covid-19 cases in these countries.

“There are 150 Korean companies here in Chennai. Most of them are vendors to Hyundai. There is constant movement of people between the two countries. This has stopped, all too suddenly. Ideally, medically fit people should be allowed. We know of Indian auto parts maker who is now stuck in Korea. He has to wait for restrictions to be removed and it is expensive for a businessman to stay doing nothing,” he said. “I wish the restrictions are eased.”
