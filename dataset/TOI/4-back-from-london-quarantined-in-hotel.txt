After reaching the quarantine facility, their primary tests were conducted and, so far, none of them have shown Covid-19 symptoms.

“As per the government policy, the flyers who have come home from various countries in special flights have to stay in institutional quarantined for four days and they have the option of staying in hotels, bearing all expenses. So they have been placed in private hotels,” Resident deputy district collector Bhagwat Doifode said. 

The health advisory of the state mentions that people landing in the country have to be first screened for health issues, and, if they are found to be in good condition, only then will they be allowed to head to quarantine facility. 

“People who returned from London were allowed to choose the facility — either hotel or the quarantine facilities put up by the concerned civic bodies. These people chose to stay in the hotel and, hence, they have been escorted to the hotels in Nashik city where they will stay for 14 days,” Doifode said. 

Doifode said that regular health check-up of these people will be carried out by the teams. They will then update the same to the state government. If a person does not report any illness till fortnight, he/she will be allowed to go home. 

In addition, two more people are expected to return from Singapore, of which, one will arrive in Nashik city. The person will be placed in the same quarantine facility at the hotel, Doifode added.
