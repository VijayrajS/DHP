Coronavirus in Pune: GPS mapping of vulnerable areas
2020-03-13
PUNE: The district administration will use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to map coronavirus vulnerable zones, Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram said on Thursday.

The exercise will be carried out as a part of the protocol issued by the central and state government health authorities. “As a part of the containment plan, vulnerable zones have been identified in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, which will be mapped with the help of GPS,” the collector told TOI.

As per the health department’s guidelines, after confirmation of a Covid-19 case in the urban areas, health officials cover the 3km and 5km radius around it. This stands at 3km and 7km radius from the confirmed case’s lodging in the rural areas. During their visit, the officials tell the residents to restrict “unnecessary movement”.

Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar confirmed that the exercise was a part of the preventive measure plan.

Both Ram and Mhaisekar reiterated that people should avoid giving out infected patients’ information on social media. Incidentally, a relative of one of the Covid-19 patients had written to the divisional commissioner on Wednesday, alleging that information about the infected patient was making the rounds on social media, creating hardships for the family. “The family is facing social boycott-like situation and this should not happen,’’ Mhaisekar said.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been asked to keep a thorough check on hoarding and pricing of masks and sanitisers. Mhaisekar said N95 masks were not needed for a general public. “All key officials from all departments have been contacted to ensure that there is proper monitoring of suspected cases,” he added.
