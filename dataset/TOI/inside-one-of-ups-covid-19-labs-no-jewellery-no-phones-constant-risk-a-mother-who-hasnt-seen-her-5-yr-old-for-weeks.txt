At the entrance of a lab at Meerut's LLRM Medical College, Dr Amit Garg carefully takes his cellphone out of his pocket and puts it away in a bag in his office.

With the elaborate armour in place, the microbiologists are ready to begin another busy day, testing samples of suspected Covid-19 patients.

Initially, we were testing 100 samples a day; the laboratory has the capacity to test 115 samples daily.
