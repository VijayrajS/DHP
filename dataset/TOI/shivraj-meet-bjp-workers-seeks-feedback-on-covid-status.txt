MP CM meet BJP workers, seeks feedback on Covid status
2020-04-30
BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh BJP has called upon the farmers to teach a lesson to the Congress for its failure to keep its farm loan waiver promise.


On Wednesday, Chouhan discussed with the BJP workers, mandal and district presidents about the Covid-19 situation in the state and urged them to provide feedback on the schemes being run by the state government for the poor and needy. Chouhan also decided to form Deendayal committees in all the rural and urban areas to monitor and provide feedback to the government on the current situation.

A day earlier, state agriculture minister Kamal Patel had asked the farmers to register FIRs against former chief minister and ministers of previous Congress government for betraying them in the name of farm loan waiver. The BJP has assured that all the farmers will get relief, Patel said.

BJP state spokesperson, Rajneesh Agrawal said, â€œthere are several farmers who are trapped in the cumbersome registration process, but have failed to get loan waiver benefit. If they are not filing cases, they should at least punish the Congress during elections in a democratic way."

Making a scathing attack on previous Congress government, the BJP state spokesperson said that it was the Congress government that failed to control the Covid-19 spread in the state during initial period. The government only pleaded ignorance and complained about paucity of funds instead of addressing the problem.

The Congress, however, reacted sharply to the BJP's move. Congress said that Congress waived off farm loans of 23 lakh farmers in first phase. "Congress government had waived off loans of 23 lakh farmers up to Rs 50,000 in the first phase of loan waiver. These farmers will teach a lesson to the BJP during the by-polls. Cases must be registered against BJP leaders for misguiding farmers," said Congress state media coordinator, Narendra Saluja.
