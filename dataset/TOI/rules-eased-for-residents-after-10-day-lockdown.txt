Kolhapur: After strict lockdown instructions for the Mangalwar Peth residents over the past 10 days — following emergence of two positive cases in the area — the district administration has now relaxed some of the rules. 

The area was declared a containment zone, as no one was allowed to enter or exit the locality. A door-to-door survey was done to identify if there are any suspected Covid-19 cases. In total 3,200 people were surveyed here. 

Accordingly, 60 people were given strict instructions of home quarantine and the health staff regularly monitored them. Six people were taken to institutional quarantine. 

Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti said that 500m surrounding the area where the positive cases were found were converted into a containment zone. “We have completed the disinfection drive in the area. Many people from the area have been screened. During these days, the locals faced some restrictions on movement. We have now made access to essential goods open to the locals,” he said. 

The health administration has confirmed that most of the samples have been tested negative. The two positive cases are undergoing treatment. 

A doctor of Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Hospital said that the health of both patients is improving. “They will be tested again in the next two to three days. And again thereafter for last time if required. Only after the swab tests comes out to be negative, the individuals will be discharged and advised home quarantine for few more days,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity.

Kalshetti said they had urged the co-passengers of the first case to get screened. “Many approached us and we advised them home quarantine. We are in continuous communication with the traced contacts," he added.
