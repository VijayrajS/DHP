Self-lockdown, don’t wait for govt: BJP to Chimbel
2020-06-14
PANAJI: State BJP vice-president Anil Hoble on Saturday appealed to the people of Chimbel to go in for a self-lockdown after a spate of Covid-19 cases in the village. Asking them not to wait for the state government to declare it a containment zone, Hoble urged people to take cue from the villages of Sattari and elsewhere, and opt for a self-imposed lockdown. 


“I urge the people of Chimbel, from Ribandar to Chinchwado, Gulebhat and Indiranagar, to go in for a lockdown,” he said. “They have all agreed. I want to appeal to them not to wait for anybody (including government) to declare a lockdown, but instead self-impose a lockdown.” He asked people not to think of it as something political. 

H e also said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has supported the call.

“I have spoken to CM Pramod Sawant about the lockdown, and he has given us his full support,” Hoble said.

He said that the people of Indiranagar should impose a self-lockdown since the houses are in close proximity. “It has a population of around 7,000,” he said. “Even if a single person there is infected, the virus will spread around the area.” 

He also said that since most people from Chimbel work in Merces, the virus could also spread there. “If it spreads to Merces, then it will spread to Ribandar, Panaji, Old Goa and Curca.” He said that while the state has seen the spread of the novel coronavirus in Mangor Hill, it would be worse in Chimbel if not controlled. 

While there have been demands that areas like Shirem in Chimbel be declared a containment zone, the government on Friday said that it hasn’t yet taken a decision, since the cases were linked to one family.
