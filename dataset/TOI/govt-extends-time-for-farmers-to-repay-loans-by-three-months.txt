DEHRADUN: In the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, the Uttarakhand government on Monday decided to provide an additional three months time to farmers to repay their loans to the state’s cooperative banks.


There are around 3.50 lakh farmers who have taken such loans in the state for agricultural purposes.

Besides, with the aim to double the farmers’ income in 2022, the Uttarakhand government had earlier announced to provide an interest-free loan of up to Rs 1 lakh for farmers and up to Rs 5 lakh for self-help groups.

Until February this year, 2.68 lakh farmers had taken loans to the tune of Rs 1,388 crore in the state. Owing to the Rabi crop, more number of farmers availed the facility in the past few months.

To help the farmers during this difficult period of Covid-19 and the nationwide lockdown, the state government has decided to give them an additional time till July, this year.

Meanwhile, state cooperative bank and district cooperative banks collectively contributed Rs 1.21 crore to the CM Relief Fund to help fight Covid-19. Cooperative minister Dhan Singh Rawat handed over the cheque to CM Trivendra Singh Rawat on Monday.
