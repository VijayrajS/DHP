Should court take note if the educated violate lockdown rules, asks HC
2020-05-29
Nagpur: Expressing concern over even educated citizens blatantly violating lockdown rules, Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court indirectly flayed their tendency to approach the judiciary after action was initiated against them."If well-educated people claiming themselves to be respected and dignified citizens continue to violate the norms, should this court either take suo motu cognisance or entertain a PIL complaining they’re not being treated in a dignified manner while flouting the rules, is the question, that needs consideration," a division bench of Justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar observed.The bench added the norms are meant for citizens’ own safety and security. “In spite of repeated requests in a dignified manner with folded hands, offering roses as a mark of protests against the movements in violation of the lockdown norms, avoiding to register the offences and imposing penalties, such citizens continue to violate rules,” the judges added.The observations came while hearing a PIL by Sandip Nair, contending that citizens who allegedly violated the lockdown, including seniors and some well-known personalities on morning walk, were subjected to inhuman indignities. The alleged violators were photographed holding placards declaring they’re enemy of the nation, society, family and humanity, since they’re breaking lockdown rules. Next day, their photographs were published in prominent newspapers and went viral on social media.“Another question on whether a petition by such violators that the police action amounts to defamation or inhuman behaviour, can be agitated by filing alternative appropriate proceedings, particularly when several disputed questions of fact are involved, also needs consideration,” the judges said.They added that the foundational facts showing serious infringement of human and constitutional rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, need to be established, in a situation where the provisions of Epidemic Act or Disaster Management Act are invoked to conclude that the end does not necessarily justify the means and it’s purely an individual grievance.While keeping it open for the commissioner of police (CP) to urge HC not to entertain such matters, the judges disposed of the petition as infructuous. “We, however, don’t intend to examine the aforesaid questions, for the reason that in response to our May 8 order, the CP has made a statement with which the petitioner claims satisfaction,” they said.Earlier, the CP in his affidavit stated he had held a meeting of all his subordinates, including deputy and assistant commissioners, and requested them to sensitize personnel under them to ensure incidents as alleged in the petition shouldn’t recur.What HC said:* In spite of repeated requests with folded hands, offering roses as a mark of protests against movements in violation of the lockdown norms, citizens continue to violate rules* If well-educated people continue to violate norms, should HC take suo motu cognisance or entertain a PIL complaining that they’re not being treated in a dignified manner* Whether their plea that police action amounts to defamation or inhuman behaviour should be considered* Norms are meant for citizens’ own safety and security* It is open for commissioner of police (CP) to urge to HC not to entertain such matters
