Pilibhit: With government stepping up measures to curb spread of coronavirus by screening people coming from abroad and suspending regular and e-visas granted to Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan, forest authorities of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) have also decided to exercise caution regarding entry of foreigners in the forests. 

Both forest authorities have issued an advisory to all foreigners to provide their medical reports before entering the forests.

“In view of the spread of coronavirus in many countries, we have decided to impose restrictions on foreign tourists. Besides, we still do not know about the effects of the Covid-19 virus is on wild animals,” said Sanjay Kumar, field director of DTR.

The screening and testing of all foreign tourists would soon be made mandatory in coordination with the health departments of each district before their entry into forest areas. “This is essential, especially in view of the contiguity of the Nepalese territory with ours,” said Kumar.

Meanwhile, a 33-year-old local resident of Pilibhit who returned from Thailand on February 9 and was kept in an isolation ward suddenly developed a cough on Friday. Doctors have sent his fresh samples to King George’s Medical University in Lucknow for tests.

Earlier, he had tested negative. The man was to be kept in isolation for 28 days. Dr Ashwani Gupta, who is monitoring the man’s condition, said he did not show any primary symptoms of affliction with Covid-19 up to 26 days but these came on the surface on the 27th day.

“His cough may be a local physical problem but as the department wants to be sure about its actual reason. We shall wait for his test reports,” Gupta added.
