THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A medical student from Wuhan, who had tested positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and was undergoing treatment at the medical college hospital in Alappuzha, was discharged on Thursday.


“The patient has been discharged as per the instructions from National Institute of Virology, Pune, as successive tests of this patient have been negative. However, the patient has been asked to be under home quarantine till this month-end,” said principal secretary (health) Rajan N Khobragade. 

However, the other two positive cases are continuing in the isolation wards of the hospitals in Thrissur and Kasaragod. “Their successive test results have to be negative and then only we can decide on discharging them. The results have to come from NIV, Pune,” said Khobragade.

Even though the successive tests have proved considerable reduction in the infection in these two cases, we are waiting for confirmatory results from NIV, he added.

The last result of Thrissur patient was negative while that of the Kasaragod patient was again positive. According to health department officials, the Kasaragod patient’s samples had been sent twice to Pune virology institute in the last few days, but, the results are yet to arrive. They said his health condition is perfect. The condition of the infected patient in Thrissur is also stable. 

On Thursday, 122 more persons, who were under home quarantine in the state, were given relaxation. At present, 2,397 people are under observation in the state of which only 22 are in hospitals. On Wednesday, 1,040 people were freed from home quarantine.

The health department has made it clear that the people under observation will be given relaxation once their quarantine period of 28 days ends. However, for a few individuals, the quarantine days have been reduced to 14 days since they do not even have the slightest of symptoms.
