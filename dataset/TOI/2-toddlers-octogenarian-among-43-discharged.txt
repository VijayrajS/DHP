INDORE: A 5-month-old baby went home with her mother on Sunday, two months after contracting Covid-19 infection. She was among the 43 patients discharged from Sri Aurbindo Institute of Medical Sciences including a four-month-old boy and 82-year-old male.

Dr Rajeev Singh, spokesperson said, “The mother of the five-month-old girl has been in different hospitals for the last two months for treatment. But, she came here couple of weeks back and now finally walked back home after getting cured.”

There were at least 17 high-risk age group people above age of 50 years of age and four children among those discharged from the hospital. Dr Ravi Dosi, HoD respiratory department SAIMS said, “Both four-month and five-month old babies were mildly symptomatic. The five-month girl was having cough but couldn’t say it is because of Covid-19.”

Both of them got infection from their mothers, said Dosi. Now, all of them are cured and went home, said Dosi. The 82-year-old male came with mild symptoms including headache was in ICU for two days. Later, he was shifted to isolation ward. The male was having some fluctuations in ECG, said Dosi. So, it was decided not to administer Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin to him. He was treated with other medicines and got cured, said Dosi. The rest high-risk persons were treated in accordance to protocol of ICMR including injection of low molecular heparin to them. HCQ is also administered, added Dosi.
