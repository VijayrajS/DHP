SECUNDERABAD: Coronavirus cases are rising across Secunderabad Cantonment with New Bowenpally recording it’s first case after a 27-year-old techie from Hanuman Nagar tested positive on Friday. Late on Thursday, a doctor living in Mahendra Hills also tested positive.

Bowenpally is one of the largest residential areas in the cantonment. Cases have been confirmed in Mahendra Hills, Bollarum, Picket and Karkhana in the civilian-military area. With these new cases, the total cases in the cantonment has gone up to 10.

“The techie is working at a multinational company. He was down with fever, cough and sore throat. He is now quarantined at Gandhi Hospital. We are waiting for the test results of three of his family members,” M Devender, SCB senior superintendent (SWM), told TOI. 

“As per new norms, we have barricaded only his house instead of the whole of Hanuman Nagar. The area is declared as a red zone, and has been sanitised,” said Devender, adding that the doctor’s house has been barricaded.

“A lady doctor, who is working at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), was tested positive on Thursday night. Her house in Mahendra Hills was barricaded and sanitised,” he said.

Meanwhile, a team of medical staff led by Dr Mary Meena Kumari, conducted door-to-door survey at Mahendra Hills, in the wake of new case. 

Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) vice-president, J Ram Krishna, who is also the representative of Mahendra Hills, said he is concerned about the rising number of cases. “Though we have taken up sanitisation thrice, covering Mahendra Hills and adjoining residential colonies, the cases are increasing. We will sanitise all the colonies in the ward again. Residents need not panic but should follow preventive measures,” Ramakrishna said.
