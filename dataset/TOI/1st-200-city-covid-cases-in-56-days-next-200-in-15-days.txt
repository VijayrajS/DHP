Nagpur: Twenty more persons from the city tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday taking the district’s tally to 407. The first 200 corona positive cases, including three deaths, were reported in 56 days, but the latest 200, including four deaths, came in just 15 days.Among the 20 who tested positive on Thursday, 12 are from Mominpura containment zone and seven from Gaddigodam containment zone. Number of cases from Mominpura containment zone increased to 219. Cases in Gaddigodam surged to 20.Total lockdown was implemented in the district from March 21. Of total 407 cases, 403 came during lockdown. This happened due to high number of cases in two hotspots — Mominpura and Satranjipura. Total number of cases from these two containment zones is 340, which is 83.53% of total cases in the district.The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) aggressive contact tracing and quarantining system planned by municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, chief medical officer Dr Yogendra Savai, additional chief medical officer Dr Praveen Gantawar and others helped detect large number of cases from the two hotspots.The biggest concern for the city now is surge in cases from Gaddigodam. Mominpura and Satranjipura have been containment zones from April 4 and 6 respectively. However, people reportedly met each other and roamed inside the containment zones, leading to many cases. But Gaddigodam was notified as containment zone only from May 16 onwards. A 65-year-old comorbidity patient from Khalasi Line, Gaddigodam, was admitted at GMCH on May 13, and tested positive on May 15. He was on ventilator and died on May 16. Therefore, chances of spread of coronavirus from Gaddigodam to other areas cannot be ruled out.Over 600 persons from this locality were quarantined as it is NMC’s model to contain spread within a slum or congested area, and stop transmission to other areas.One remaining positive case on Thursday came from Bajeria in Central Nagpur. It is a new area for Covid-19. “A girl was admitted at IGGMCH for consuming something in an attempt to commit suicide 3-4 days ago. Her samples were taken for Covid-19 testing and came positive on Thursday,” said NMC sources.Now, Bajeria will be a new containment zone increasing their number to 19 in existence in the city.Number of samples tested increased to 9,367 on Thursday. Thus, positivity rate is 4.34%. On Thursday, 580 samples tested negative, the highest number to test negative in a single day in the district. Earlier highest was 562 on March 12.Total nine corona positive patients were discharged, increasing the number of discharged persons to 310. Eight were discharged from GMCH and remaining one from IGGMCH.
