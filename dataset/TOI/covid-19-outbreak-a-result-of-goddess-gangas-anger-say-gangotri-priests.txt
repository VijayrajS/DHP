Covid-19 outbreak a result of goddess Ganga’s anger, say Gangotri priests
2020-03-26
Dehradun: The head priest of Gangotri shrine said on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is because of “goddess Ganga’s anger.” He alleged that the calamity had befallen because of the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Act that the state assembly recently passed and which gives control of around 50 temples including the four Char Dham shrines to the Uttarakhand government.

“I had on many platforms, warned the state and Union governments to withdraw the Char Dham Shrine Board Act, or else there will be a disaster that will cost lives. Now this has come true,” said Shiv Prakash, the head priest (rawal) of Gangotri.

The priest had some weeks ago asked pilgrims not to visit the Char Dham shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri alleging that “they might witness something worse than the 2013 tragedy because of the Act brought about by the government.”
