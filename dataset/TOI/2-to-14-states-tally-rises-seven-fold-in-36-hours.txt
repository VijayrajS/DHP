2020-03-22
AHMEDABAD: The health and family welfare department stated that on Saturday, the samples of six persons returned positive for COVID-19. The figure was two on Thursday and five on Friday. Sources in the health department said that a primary test of a woman from Kutch came back positive, but a confirmatory report is awaited.


Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani at a media interaction on Saturday confirmed that the state had 13 positive cases as of Saturday afternoon and one case was a 67-year-old man from Surat with no history of foreign travel. The person had gone to Jaipur and Delhi and later developed symptoms.

“We are closely watching the internal spread, so far we have seen cases with travel to countries such as US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, UK, Sri Lanka, Spain and Finland. Isolation of all persons with a history of travel abroad is the most effective way of prevent the spread. We are still not at Stage III where the infection spreads in the community,” said a senior state health department official. 

The number of passengers at Ahmedabad and Surat airports has decreased but a significant number of people are still returning home, said health department officials, adding that more than 100 persons were either put under quarantine or were advised home isolation.

To tackle the increase in cases and need for isolation, the state government will add up to 3,500-4,000 beds.
