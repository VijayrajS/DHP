Nine Filipinos to be arrested after lockdown: Vashi cops
2020-04-22
NAVI MUMBAI: Vashi police are waiting for the lockdown to end to arrest the nine Filipinos who had been booked for violating visa norms and prohibition orders two weeks ago. “We have taken necessary steps to ensure that they do not leave India when international flights resume after lockdown ends,” said Vashi police senior inspector Sanjeev Dhumal.


On April 5, the police had registered an FIR against 10 Filipinos for visa violation norms as they had lived in a religious place in Vashi between March 10 and 16 without informing the local police after returning from the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi. Though three of them tested positive for Covid-19, they did not selfquarantine themselves. One of the affected Filipinos succumbed to the virus. Later, the office-bearer of the religious place, his son, a house maid and his 18-month-old grandson tested positive for coronavirus.

The 10 Filipinos were booked for violation of prohibition order during lockdown under IPC Sections 188, 269 and 270, as well as the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, Maharashtra Covid-19 Management Rule, 2020 and Foreigner Act, 1946.
