VADODARA: Another bank branch in Chhota Udepur district suspended its operations after one of its staffers tested positive for coronavirus last weekend. 

The Gadh Boriyad branch of Bank of Baroda (BoB) shut its operations and around 10 staff members have home quarantined themselves as Covid-19 report of one staff member turned out to be positive on Saturday. The employee is currently undergoing treatment in Ahmedabad. He was planning to fly back to his home in Hyderabad when his reports arrived.

Sources said that the man had developed mild fever on June 2 and next day his temperature spiked due to which he was sent home to Naswadi town early. On June 4, swab samples of three staff members were collected for tests. Since the reports did not arrive next day, the coronavirus affected staff member booked his flight tickets through website and went to Ahmedabad airport on Saturday in a hired car. 

Health department sources said that while he was waiting for departure at the airport, the reports were received. “We could not get through his mobile phone, but later he responded to one of his colleagues’ call. He was convinced by his colleague to get himself admitted,” an official said. When he agreed, the health department coordinated with their counterparts in Ahmedabad and the man was admitted.

Meanwhile, the other bank staffers were asked by their higher-ups to quarantine themselves for a week. 

On Monday, when the branch, which serves around 80 villages in the tribal-dominated district, did not open several customers who had travelled several kilometres for banking work had to return empty-handed.
