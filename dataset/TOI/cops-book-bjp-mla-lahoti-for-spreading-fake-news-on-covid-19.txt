JAIPUR: Sanganer BJP MLA Ashok Lahoti was booked by police for giving inflammatory speeches and spreading fake news about Covid-19. 


A resident of Rajat Path in Mansarovar lodged a complaint against the MLA at the local police station claiming that Lahoti was instrumental in spreading disharmony. 

Mansarovar SHO Suneel Kumar said, “We received a complaint on Friday night from a local resident who alleged that Lahoti was spreading fake news and trying to promote communal disharmony. Apparently, the complainant came across the MLA’s press releases in which something to this effect was written. We have registered a case.” 

Officials claimed that when a case against an MLA is registered, it is transferred to a higher authority. “When a case is registered against an MLA and political leaders, it is transferred to CID-CB and we have also prepared the file which we forwarded to them. Now, they will carry out further investigation to check the veracity of the allegations.”

A case under IPC sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 505 (Statements conducing to public mischief) and others have been registered against the MLA. 

 Last year too, the ACB had registered a case against Lahoti and others after receiving a complaint that he had misused his powers when he held the post of mayor.
