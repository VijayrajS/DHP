NASHIK: The relatives of a suspected Covid-19 patient created ruckus at the sub-civil hospital in Malegaon after the 42-year-old man died within hours of getting admitted.


During the ruckus the relatives entered the quarantine facility and started banging the oxygen cylinder. They also broke the air-cooler meant for the patients.

“A suspected patient was admitted to the quarantine facility on Sunday afternoon. The man died of complication while being treated. When the family was informed about the death, they went berserk,” Pankaj Ashiya, deputy collector and coordinating chief of the Emergency Operating Centre (EOC), said. 

The relatives also got into an altercation with the staff following which the staff threatened to go on strike. However, timely intervention of police helped in easing the tension.

“There was no manhandling of the staff, but property was damaged. A case has been registered against two people, but they not been arrested yet,” additional superintendent of police Sandeep Ghuge said.

Policemen have already been deployed at the hospital.
