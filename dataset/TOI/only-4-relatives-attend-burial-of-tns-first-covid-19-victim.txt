MADURAI: The body of the 54-year-old man from Anna Nagar in Madurai city, who died on Wednesday night while undergoing treatment for Covid-19, was laid to rest at a burial ground in Melamadai early in the morning.


His wife, son and two brothers were the only relatives around when the body was taken to the grave.

It was around 2 am that health minister C Vijayabaskar declared the man, who was admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), dead. He said the patient had a medical history of prolonged illness with steroid-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and uncontrolled diabetes with hypertension.

The body was shifted directly to the burial ground from GRH around 3.30 am after the authorities completed the hospital procedures. The body was alighted from the hearse van and kept at the ground for an hour until the work of digging the pit was complete.

Other than the family members, a police team from Madhichiyam station which accompanied the body, was also present. There was no medical team or sanitation officers during the burial, which was completed by 5 am.

Meanwhile, the district administration locked down all the ways leading to the street where he was hailing from using barricades fastened with ropes. All the people from 60 houses on the street have been kept under watch. In addition, one street on either side of the particular street has also been locked down. Barricades have been erected at least at eight places to make sure that no one leaves the place or an outsider goes in, police sources said.

Only the residents are allowed to enter, that too after showing proof of residency in the street. One member from the family is allowed to purchase essential articles like milk and groceries from stores available there itself.
