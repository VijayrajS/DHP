Hit by lockdown, Uttar Pradesh workers forced to walk to homes from Haridwar
2020-03-28
HARDIWAR: The non-availability of any public transport due to the 21-day lockdown has forced workers and daily wagers from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh who work at factories in SIDCUL to walk all the way to their homes. The migrant workers claim that they don’t have the money to survive for 21 days in Haridwar while adding that the essential commodities are being sold at higher-than-usual prices in the city.


These workers are mostly from the western districts (Bijnor, Moradabad, Saharanpur, and Muzaffarnagar) of Uttar Pradesh and live in slum colonies in Haridwar. “We don't have enough money to pay our rent or buy food. We don’t want to leave Haridwar but we don’t have any other option. We can’t survive this lockdown period without any work and money,” said Ashish (40), a daily wager who hails from Bijnor.

Meanwhile, the state forest department has deployed its teams on the Haridwar-Bijnor highway (which is close to the Rajaji Tiger Reserve) to help these workers pass safely and provide food packets to them. The officials have assured that they will protect these migrant workers from any attack while they pass through Shyampur-Chidiyapur pass, which is frequented by wild animals.

Akash Verma, divisional forest officer of Haridwar forest division, told TOI, “Two patrol teams of forest guards have been deployed on the highway to help the stranded workers pass safely. We are also providing them with food packets at Chadighat and Chidiyapur post.”
