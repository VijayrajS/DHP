Andhra Pradesh: Focus shifts to virus containment clusters in red zones
2020-04-30
AMARAVATI: In an aggressive approach to contain the spread of Covid-19, the state government has segregated red zones into three different clusters and directed district collectors to go for micro-level management.

The government has designated 73 zones as very active clusters, 55 active clusters and 73 dormant clusters within existing red zones depending on the number of positive cases in each cluster.

Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy reviewed the latest status of Covid-19 containment measures with senior officials at the CMâ€™s camp office on Wednesday. The officials said the state was on the right track as it had increased screening of patients in all districts. Special chief secretary (health) KS Jawahar Reddy said 13 clusters within the red zones have not reported a single positive case in the last 28 days.

He said segregating red zones into micro clusters would help district administrations take up effective measures to contain the virus spread. He said 27 of the 29 positive cases in Guntur district came from Narasaraopet town and the new analysis will provide a focused approach.

The chief minister directed the officials to entrust the third joint collector to be appointed in the district with the task of overseeing the YSR telemedicine wing in the districts. He said YSR telemedicine would be the new normal post-lockdown system and help people take medical aid without leaving home.

The officials explained that trial testing has begun at Srikakulam medical college lab and labs in Ongole and Nellore were being readied. They said all three laboratories would start functioning by Saturday. Covid-19 tests on the suspects identified during the family survey would be completed within three days.
