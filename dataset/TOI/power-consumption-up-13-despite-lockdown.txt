2020-05-06
PATNA: Electricity consumption in the state capital increased by up to 13.6% in the last couple of days owing to rise in temperature, an energy department official said on Tuesday. The rise in power consumption during the lockdown period, though, has surprised many.


The maximum power demand on Monday was 334megawatt (mw) at 8pm, the highest in the last 40 days since the lockdown was announced by the Centre. The power demand had dipped in the initial days of lockdown as all commercial establishments, malls, restaurants, hotels, coaching classes, hostels, educational institutions and industrial units were closed.

Interestingly, the peak power demand is still low when compared to last year’s figures of above 400mw per day in April and May.

Dilip Kumar Singh, general manager of Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (PESU), said the electricity demand would further increase as temperature has started to rise. “The average peak demand is increasing as many households have started using air- conditioners and coolers. The peak demand was low in April compared to the same month last year. It varied in the range of 250mw to 320mw per day,” Singh said.

He added, “As the commercial establishments are still closed due to extended lockdown till May 17, there won’t be much change in peak power demand. Before the lockdown, the peak power demand stood at 360mw on March 21,” Singh said.

According to PESU data, the maximum power demand in the city was 320MW on Sunday, 294mw on May 2 and 298mw on May 1.

Another energy department official said though overloading of transformers is generally witnessed in May, no such case has been reported from any district in the state so far. The state recorded peak power demand of 4,100mw on Sunday, he added.
