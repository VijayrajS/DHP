NEW DELHI: Vishwa Hindu Parishad has called for a complete ban on Tablighi Jamaat and its Nizamuddin Markaz besides freezing of its bank accounts and closure of all its offices for endangering the lives of people after many Covid-19 cases across India were attributed to attendees of its congregation here last month. 


“The whole of India is in serious crisis due to the country-wide criminal misdeeds of Tablighi Jamaat and its Nizamuddin Markaz,” said VHP’s central joint general secretary Surendra Jain, seeking a ban on the outfit.
