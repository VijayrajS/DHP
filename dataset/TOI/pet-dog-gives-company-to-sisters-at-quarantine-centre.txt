Pet dog gives company to sisters at quarantine centre

BEGUSARAI: Dogs are known for their unconditional loyalty and considered man’s best friends. This unflinching love for each other came to the fore in Begusarai on Wednesday when two young sisters refused to go to nearby quarantine centre without their dog, a white colour Pomeraian breed and aged about one year. 

The sisters did not want to leave the dog alone in the house at Garhara railway colony after their parents tested positive for Covid-19. The authorities had to agree to let the dog accompany the two sisters to the nearby Asurari government middle school quarantine centre as the small dog also resisted every bid to part with them.

Incharge of Asurarari Government Middle School quarantine centre Mithu Prasad said the sisters were discharged on Friday along with two other women and sent to home quarantine after they tested negative for coronavirus. “The dog was allowed to accompany the sisters during their quarantine after I made an appeal to Barauni circle officer (CO) Sujit Suman in this regard,” he said.

The CO said the father of the sisters is a cancer patient and had gone to Mumbai for treatment before returning home on May 8 after obtaining special permission. 

“The cancer patient had gone to Mumbai along with his wife and a son. However, the man and his wife were later tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. As the condition of the man deteriorated, he was referred to Patna for treatment. His wife, on the other hand, was put in an isolation centre, leaving the two sisters to go to the quarantine centre with their pet dog,” Suman added.
