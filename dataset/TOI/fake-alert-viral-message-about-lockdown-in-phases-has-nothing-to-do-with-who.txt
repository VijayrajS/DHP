2020-04-05
CLAIM

A message that is going viral on WhatsApp claims that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has a 'procedure and protocol' for lockdown and that India is only in the second phase of it as of now.

Here's what the message says: 

'WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION PROTOCOL&PROCEDURE OF LOCKDOWN PERIODS FOR CONTROLLING ON MOST DANGEROUS VIRUS

STEP 1 - 1 DAY.
STEP 2- 21 DAYS.
AFTER 5 DAYS.
STEP 3- 28 DAYS.
AFTER 5 DAYS.
STEP 4 - 15 DAYS.

The same way, our Indian governments are follow:
MAR22-1 DAY ( TRIAL LOCKDOWN)

MAR24-APR14 - 21 DAYS(FIRST LOCKDOWN)

APRIL15- APRIL19 - RELAX FROM LOCKDOWN.

APR20 - MAY 18 - 28DAYS(SECOND LOCKDOWN)

Incase Covid19 patient ratio is Zero, withdraw the LOCKDOWN. Otherwise,

May19 - May 24 - Relax from LOCKDOWN.

May 25 - June 10 - 15 days (FINAL LOCKDOWN).

NEED TO CHECK OUT ON THIS PROTOCOL, KEEP YOURSELF MENTALLY PREPARED (sic).

Many alert Times Fact Check users sent the message to us on our WhatsApp number asking if WHO indeed issued such a protocol. 

 


TRUTHThe World Health Organisation has nothing to do with the claims made in the message that is now viral on WhatsApp.

Times Fact Check scanned the WHO website but couldn't find any such 'procedure or protocol' suggested to India or any other country for that matter. 

The 'lockdown in phases' is a product of some fake-news peddler's imagination and it is now viral. 

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had said that there is no plan to 
extend the nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19 in the country.
