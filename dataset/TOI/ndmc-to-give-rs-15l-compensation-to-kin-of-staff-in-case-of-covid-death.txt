2020-05-04
NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) will pay a compensation of Rs 15 lakh to the heirs of an employee in case of their death due to Covid-19 while on duty. All employees, including contractual and daily wagers, will be eligible for the compensation.

“All municipal services to contain the spread of infection by the novel coronavirus are being provided to residents and important offices like central government building, diplomatic missions, etc. Though NDMC is adopting all measures to safeguard and protect its staff, it has been felt necessary to assure financial help to motivate them in these difficult times,” said an official.

NDMC’s compensation scheme is valid for next three months and no age limit has been prescribed for it. “ This facility will, however, not cover those not attending duties or it cannot be established that their death occurred due to Covid-19,” said the official.

The civic agency has also decided to reimburse all medical bills and facilities used during the treatment of its contractual and muster roll employees for coronavirus infection. Their family members will also be covered under the scheme. There are around 6,000 contractual and RMR employees in NDMC.
