HYDERABAD: In the first instance of a policeman succumbing to the novel coronavirus in Telangana, a 2007 batch constable died on Wednesday while undergoing treatment in Gandhi Hospital. Hyderabad police said that the constable, who had been undergoing treatment since May 13 at Gandhi Hospital, died at around 10.30pm. Meanwhile, 40 of his contacts were tested of whom 28 tested negative. Results on the rest are awaited.

Confirming the cop’s demise, Telangana DGP M Mahendar Reddy in a tweet said: “#PoliceConstableOfficer Dayakar Reddy a #Covid19FrontLineWarrior of @hydcitypolice died of #CoronaVirus last night @ GandhiHospital. My Heartfelt Condolences to the bereaved family members. The Govt & #TSPolice will standby & support the family in #TheHourOfDistress by all means (sic).”

“We suspect that he would have contracted the virus during the enforcement duties, especially when he was in check post duty,’’ Hyderabad police said. Sources said he was suffering from fever in the last 15 days but continued to report for duty. On May 13, when he went to the police station concerned where he is attached, his higher-ups directed him to go to Nature Cure Hospital. 

Later, he was taken to King Koti Hospital from where he was shifted to Gandhi after testing positive. The cop is survived by his wife and two children. He was cremated late at night.
