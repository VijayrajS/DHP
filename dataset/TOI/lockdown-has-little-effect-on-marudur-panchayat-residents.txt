Lockdown has little effect on Marudur panchayat residents
2020-04-14
TRICHY: For people in Panikampatti village, lockdown has hardly made any difference as many are seen roaming on the streets unmindful of keeping social distance. Same is the case with Koodalur village where shops could be seen open after 1pm where people are shopping groceries.

These villages are located within 8km from Periya Palam where the first positive case of Covid-19 was reported in Karur district. Locals blame it on Marudur town panchayat that has failed to take proactive steps sensitizing people.

“Since most of the people are farmers, they cannot be fully blamed for ignorance,” says K Sundaresan, 41, from Panikampatti village who works in a private company in Trichy. But the local body workers have not shown up even for the basic sanitising work as it is happening in other villages and panchayats.

“The rain a couple of days ago has adversely affected banana corps and other plantations. People didn’t wear face mask or even cover their face here,” said S Rajesh, a local from Koodalur village.

Police personnel too seem to be ignorant unlike in the city where there is strict vigil. Panikampatti can be an ideal example of how lockdown is flouted. However, the consequences can be catastrophic, even if it is a village, he said.

Officials from Marudur panchayat could not be reached for comment despite attempts over phone.
