JAIPUR: All government and private offices, malls, transport operations barring essential services will remain shut across the state till March 31 as chief minister Ashok Gehlot directed a complete lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.


The order states all factories, public transport, shops and private and government offices will remain closed from March 22 till March 31. Governor Kalraj Mishra had recently issued a notification declaring coronavirus as a pandemic while making it mandatory for doctors to report each and every case to the health authorities.

Gehlot has also directed the labour department to make sure that no employee working in factories is sacked during the period. “Factory owners should give holidays to their employees till the lockdown is over,” said Gehlot. To ensure that no family faces shortage of food, he said families registered under NFSA will get the two months of food supplies in advance for free.

 
 

Similar arrangements have been made for street vendors, daily wage earners and those in need living in urban areas. 

“The local administration will provide them two months’ ration on or from April 1,” said Gehlot.

The chief minister has formed a high-level committee to take important decisions and to ensure its strict implementation. The committee is headed by additional chief secretary (home) Rajiv Swaroop.

The government has also decided to release pensions under social welfare schemes early-April.
