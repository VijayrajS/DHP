BAREILLY: Defying Covid-19 protocol, a 30-year-old woman stayed back at a hospital in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri to feed her 10-month-old son who is Covid-19 positive.


The father of the two children, a ten-month-old son and a three-year-old daughter, had returned from Mumbai a week ago and the three members of the family tested positive on May 17. They were admitted to the hospital but the situation became serious when the boy refused to eat. 

Unable to see her children suffer, the woman, armed with masks, gloves and a sanitizer, stayed back when all efforts by the administration failed.

Nodal officer of the hospital Dr Balbeer Singh said that the woman accompanied the children and refused to leave the hospital room. “I finally had to allow her to stay,” he said.

Kheri chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agarwal added, “We provided milk powder, diapers and every possible item but still the child kept crying. Even if it is against protocol, we had no option but to allow the woman to stay with her children and feed them. We couldn’t have let the boy die of hunger.”

Dr Agarwal added that the family has now been shifted to a higher centre in Lucknow. “SGPGI Lucknow has a specialised children’s ward and they will be taken care of there. We were also monitoring the woman and her samples had tested negative on Monday.”

The father of the children returned to his native Barkheria Jat village a week ago from Mumbai. The health department then brought him to a quarantine centre and sent his samples for testing which showed it to be Covid positive. The children also tested positive soon after but the woman was negative.

Meanwhile, district magistrate Shailendra Singh assured that the children were being shifted to SGPGI Lucknow for better treatment and their mother has also accompanied them.
