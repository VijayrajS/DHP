PUNE: Baking seems to be one of the most effective way to keep anxiety at bay during the lockdown. More and more women across the city are getting creative with the dough.

Bavdhan resident Reshma Dalvi, 60, attended baking classes 40 years ago but she didn’t pursue the passion at the time. “I would bake for my kids when they were young. Then they grew up and it was all about eating healthy, less fat and sugar. Now that my husband and I are spending the lockdown at home, I wanted to revisit my passion for baking. I even found an old diary of recipes I used to keep back in the 80s. It helps me keep my mind off the constant Covid news,” she said. Her delicious hits include banana muffins with nuts, pista biscuits and the classic mawa cake. “I put pictures of the goodies I had baked on social media and people started asking for recipes. It has lifted my spirits. I want to try baking bread and pav now,” she added.

Pallavi Patil always wanted to try her hand at baking but never found the time to indulge until now. “I’m a yoga instructor and I usually wouldn’t have the time but I always wanted to bake. Now, when my son sees any treats while watching TV, he asks me if I can make it. Since I have the time, I thought why not give it a try. I started with cookies then went on to bake cakes, puddings and so on,” said the 37-year-old.

 For 28-year-old Malancha Bag, who lives in Vimannagar, baking was therapeutic. “It makes the baker and those enjoying the delicacies happy. Since there was no way of getting a fancy cake for my dad’s birthday, I decided to bake his favourite sponge cake, which he loves to enjoy at teatime. Not only was my dad overcome with joy when he saw the cake, I also thoroughly enjoyed making it. The supper fluffy, eggless, butter sponge cake requires minimum ingredients and can be stored for a long time, unlike cream cakes,” she said.
