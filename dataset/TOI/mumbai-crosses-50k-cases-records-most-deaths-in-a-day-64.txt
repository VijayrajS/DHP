MUMBAI: On a day the city started limping back to normalcy with BEST buses resuming services, Mumbai crossed 50,000 Covid-19 cases. With the addition of 1,311 fresh cases on Monday, Mumbai’s case tally reached 50,085, three months after the virus arrived here. The city also recorded its highest deaths in a day, 64, taking its overall toll to 1,702. Maharashtra logged 2,553 cases and 109 deaths.


The city now contributes nearly 57% of the state’s caseload. If Mumbai were a country, it would be occupying the 22nd spot in the global Covid-19 chart today. Countries like South Africa and Sweden have fewer cases than Mumbai, which since May 31, has added over 10,000 new cases to its tally.

 

In fact, nearly a quarter of the state’s 88,528 cases have come in the first eight days of June. Maharashtra added 2,553 new cases on Monday, surpassing China with a margin of 5,000 cases at least. In the past eight days, the state has added 20,876 cases to its tally. Maharashtra added 109 Covid-19 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to 3,169. Of the deaths, according to the public health department, 32 are from the last two days while the other 77 are from the period May 3 to June 5. Seventy deaths or 64% are from the Mumbai region.

Of the 50,085 cases in Mumbai, 263,45 are currently active. Of the 88,528 cases in the state, 44,374 are currently under treatment. The city took 33 days to jump from 10,000 to 50,000 cases.

Rising deaths in the city have emerged as a cause for concern, though. The city has seen 423 deaths in the first eight days of June. One of the deans said deaths have started reducing at the tertiary hospitals. “There are still delays in patients reaching hospital. But largely deaths are on a slide in Nair and KEM hospitals,” he said. The previous single-day highest deaths seen in the city was 61 on Sunday. The case fatality rate for Mumbai and Maharashtra continues to be under 4%, though numbers for June have seen a jump. 

Civic officials said they are anticipating a spurt in cases over the next 8-10 days since several offices and shops have opened from Monday. It said that for better bed management, the job of allocation has been decentralised and assigned to ward war rooms. “For effective and faster bed allotment, 24 ward war rooms have been activated,” it said in a statement. Those who do not have symptoms or are mildly symptomatic and are under home isolation will also be monitored by the ward teams for the next 15 days.

Allotment of ambulances too will be managed at ward levels. Every ward level war room will have extra telephone lines, which will be managed in three shifts by doctors, supporting staff, teachers and students. A team of 10-12 people will be working in the war rooms.

Meanwhile, rate of recovery of the state is seeing a steady rise, with 1,611 people discharged on Monday. The total number of people discharged crossed the 40,000 mark, reaching 40,975.
