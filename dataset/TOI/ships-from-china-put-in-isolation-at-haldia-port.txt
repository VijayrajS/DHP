KOLKATA: Two ships from China that entered the Haldia Dock Complex (HDC) of Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust (SPMPT) via Singapore on Friday have been isolated though no crew member was diagnosed with symptoms of the deadly Coronavirus. The pilots who boarded these ships at the Sandheads to guide them to the Haldia port also wore special suits and masks as a precaution against the virus.

“The 128.6-metre long MT Royal Peridot flies a Marshall Islands flag. However, it entered the port from China via Singapore. All 24 crew members are from Myanmar. It reached HDC around 9.30am and was detained outside the lock gate. Medical teams boarded the vessel and carried out tests using thermal scanners. All the crew members were cleared by the Public Health Organisation around 11.30am and it was allowed to enter the port,” a senior SPMPT official said.

The same happened with Indian flag carrier MT Neelambari that had visited the Gaolan port in China on January 20. All the 28 Indian crew members were checked for symptoms of coronavirus before the tanker was allowed to enter the port.

“We are taking all necessary precautions. The crew members of these two vessels have not been allowed shore leave. Boarding of the ships has been restricted and those given permission are taking special protection,” the official added.
