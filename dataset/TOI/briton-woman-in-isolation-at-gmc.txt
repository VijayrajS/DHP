PANAJI: A female Briton was quarantined at GMC early Thursday morning. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said the Briton “was detected with symptoms of the virus on arrival at Goa International Airport”.


On Wednesday, two other persons who had travelled to Germany and Malaysia were placed in isolation.

The suspect from Germany was discharged on Thursday after her report came negative, Bandekar said. 

The other two are responding well to treatment while reports of their swab samples sent to a Mumbai laboratory are awaited.
