Jail within jail: Quarantine must for new prisoners
2020-04-23
AHMEDABAD: With over 2,500 prisoners, the Sabarmati Central Jail is like a small township. Like the rest of the world, the jail is taking steps in response to Covid-19. 

The jail authorities have set up a jail within the jail. In fact, all 33 jails in the state have created a quarantine ward where every new prisoner is housed for 14 days before being shifted to a barrack.

Additional DGP jails K L N Rao said that the jail staff, and doctors and paramedical staff of jail hospitals, are being advised through video-conferences about dealing with the sickness of colleagues or prisoners.

“We have compiled a list of hospitals with their telephone numbers in every district so that anyone who shows Covid-19 symptoms can be sent for treatment immediately, ” Rao said.

On Tuesday, to check the preparedness of the jail staff, a mock drill was conducted at the Sabarmati jail. The task was to deal with a prisoner who starts showing symptoms of Covid-19.

“The jail staff give the prisoner oxygen and then a police ambulance takes him to a designated hospital,” Rao said.

The police ambulance, jail staff, and doctors are then sanitized and all get back to work.
