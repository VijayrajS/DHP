PANAJI: Construction activity continues to pick up in the state with the availability of raw material also improving, said industry stakeholders.


The MHA’s decision to allow migrant workers to leave the state has some smaller builders worried but CREDAI – Goa does not expect a significant impact on construction activity in the days to come. Real estate developers have also begun to notice an increase in raw material prices, which could remain on the higher side, said stakeholders. 

 

“Most sites have started work again and each contractor will have his own workers. Activity may slow down if many workers leave, no doubt, but it won’t stop,” said CREDAI – Goa president Nilesh Salkar. Construction projects where raw material and labour is available have started full fledged activity and have also begun to release wages to workers to ensure them a decent livelihood. 

What is worrying builders is the increase in rates for a truck of sand, which comes from across the border. 

A builder who did not wish to be named said that authorities at the checkposts are stopping and seizing trucks carrying sand. Under the cover of darkness, sand is being extracted from Tiracol river, said the builder. Sand extraction is prohibited in Goa. 

“Sales inquiries are coming in but many builders have not yet opened their offices even though construction has started at a proper pace,” said a Panaji-based builder. 

Construction activity at Mapusa, Porvorim, Dabolim, Kadamba Plateau and Sancoale has resumed with builders trying to complete as much work as possible before the monsoons set in. 

“Only work that does not happen during the monsoons is new foundation. Once the plinth is complete, work inside goes on. The site work does slow down because of the rains but internal masonry, finishing goes on,” said Salkar.
