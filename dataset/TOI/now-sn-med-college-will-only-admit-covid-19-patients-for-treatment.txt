2020-04-20
Agra: Agra administration on Sunday decided to earmark government’s SN Medical College (SNMC) Hospital exclusively for treatment of Covid-19 patients, after 20 people, including three resident doctors, health workers and their family members, tested positive for the infection. 

Confirming this, district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said that the medical college will treat Covid-19 patients only and non-Covid patients will be treated at the district hospital to contain the spread of the infection among health workers, who are working together in the same premises. However, emergency services will remain operational at the medical college, he added.

Babloo Kumar, SSP, told TOI that many ward boys have tested positive for the disease as they were not following social distancing rules. “Though ward boys were not allowed to meet anyone while deputed in the Covid ward, they were ignoring the directions. Now, they will not be allowed to go anywhere and will be grounded on the campus till they complete their 21-day cycle of quarantine and seven days of duty in the Covid ward,” he said. 

District authorities have also issued an advisory for private hospitals to allow only 30-40% of manpower for treating their patients at one go, so that the remaining staff can be used in rotation when the earlier one goes back home after completing a certain period at the hospital. All these steps are being taken to contain the spread of coronavirus in Agra, said officials. 

Till now, nine health workers from various departments of the medical college, three resident doctors and their family members have tested positive for coronavirus.
