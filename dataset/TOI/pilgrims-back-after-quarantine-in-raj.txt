2020-05-01
Hyderabad: After spending more than 40 days of isolation in a quarantine facility in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer, a group of 11 pilgrims from Old City’s Darulshifa are back in Hyderabad. They were brought back to Darulshifa on April 28.

A relative of the family, Syed Mujtaba Hussain told TOI that the 11 members, who had gone to Iran and Iraq on a pilgrimage in March, were quarantined at Jaisalmer after their arrival in Delhi on March 18. “They were brought to Hyderabad two days ago,” he said.

On March 7, the pilgrims were supposed to have taken a flight from Mashhad in Iran, travel to Sharjah and from there, arrive in Hyderabad on March 8. However, with no flights operating from Mashhad due to coronavirus pandemic, they were stranded. TOI carried a report on their plight. Juveria Fatima, one of the pilgrims, had put out a video appealing for help. 

The Indian embassy in Iran responded to their pleas. After testing negative for Covid-19, they returned in special flights arranged by the Indian government.
