JAIPUR: In a relief to parents suffering financial losses during Covid-19, the School Shiksha Pariwar, a private schools’ organisation in Rajasthan, has decided to recover pending fees in nine months.

According to the government guidelines, school fees from April to June were deferred till July. Parents were to deposit the three months’ fees in July in addition to next three months’ fees. So, to reduce the burden of parents for depositing six months’ fees, parents who are financially not capable of depositing it in one go can do so in nine months.

Anil Sharma, president of the organisation, said, “A three-member committee will be set up in every school that will analyse every case forwarded to them. One parent, principal and teacher will be part of the committee. Parents have to apply to this committee. As per the analysis of the committee, if parents are not able to pay the fees in one go, they can pay it in nine installments. Parents are integral part of our schools and in the time of crisis how can we not support them.”

Another important decision taken was that this year fees will not be increased. There are 30,000 private schools in Rajasthan in which 60 lakh students are studying.

Due to the pandemic, all the economic activities were shut down and huge revenue losses were faced by people. The government in April had decided that fees from April to June will be deferred i.e. to be paid later. The decision does not imply that fees is waived, just deferred.

There are, however, many complaints being received from parents that private schools have started making phone calls to them to deposit fees. Many schools postponed their summer vacations to keep pestering them to pay fees.
