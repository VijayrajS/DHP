The civic body has asked the RWAs and facility managers of the condominiums and gated societies to make residents follow a specific set of guidelines to combat novel coronavirus.

“We have released a set of guidelines and recommendations for the residents and also distributed pamphlets in the condominiums and gated societies, ensuring they are followed,” said an MCG official.

The official added that the RWAs have welcomed the step which specifies uniform guidelines to be followed all across. “I had been discussing with the authorities that there is a need to ascertain a set of guidelines for the residents to follow. Now, that we have the specific steps in place, it would be easier to bring uniformity,” said Sudhir Sacdeva, a resident of Sushant Lok-1.

Residents said that in the absence of guidelines, there was no uniformity in what needs to be followed. The recommendations include temperature screening for all workers/visitors, guests, delivery personnel; hand sanitizers at the entrance; additional wiping down of elevators, handrails and common surfaces with disinfectants; supply of soaps/disinfectants to all workers and security personnel for their home use; masks for security guards and gloves for the housekeeping staff.

Moreover, it is also recommended to educate the housekeeping and security staff about the measures. “If your community is using a gate security app for visitors, do ensure that it is not touched by the visitors. Wipe with cloth and disinfectants every two hours. Reduce group activities for kids and parents in the apartment complex and avoid visitors as far as feasible,” read the guidelines released by the MCG.
