Karnataka: 12 more labs to start Covid-19 tests in one week
2020-04-26
BENGALURU: Karnataka, which has been steadily increasing the number of Covid-19 tests every day, plans add at least 12 RT-PCR diagnostic labs, taking the total number of such facilities to 30 by April 30. 


The move comes in the wake of apprehensions expressed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) over rapid antibody-testing kits, which were expected to boost the state’s testing capacity amid an increasing number of asymptomatic coronavirus cases. The state government is yet to use these kits, though it has placed orders.

As on April 23, nearly 69% of the 445 cases reported in Karnataka were asymptomatic, up from about 60% a week before. Almost every expert recommends scaling up testing to ascertain the extent of the viral spread and to prepare corresponding containment strategies. 

“Right now, we have 18 testing centres in Karnataka; another 12 are in the pipeline. Two at Kidwai (institute) in Bengaluru and one in Gadag should begin testing in a couple of days. By April 30, we should have 30 labs in Karnataka,” Dr CN Manjunath, Karnataka’s nodal testing officer, told STOI.

Between April 12 and 22, the number of Covid-19 tests conducted in Karnataka jumped by a staggering 374 per cent, from 691 to 3,279. Here’s how the transition happened: from 691 tests on April 12, the figure rose to 957 on April 13, 1,812 on April 17, and 2,733 on April 21 before crossing the 3,000-mark on April 22.

Despite the growth, challenges remain. The state is still struggling to process all samples that are collected; there’s a backlog of at least 30%. “Our target is to test at least 5,000 samples per day and we should be able to do that with the additional 12 labs by the end of this month,” Dr Manjunath said.
