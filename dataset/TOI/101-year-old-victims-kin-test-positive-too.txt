Mumbai: 101-year-old victim’s kin test Covid-19 positive too
2020-04-11
MUMBAI: The son and daughter-in-law of a 101-year-old woman—the oldest in the state to succumb to coronavirus on Thursday—have tested positive as well. 

Grappling with several questions and grief, the son told TOI on Friday his mother was barely mobile and could only walk a few steps. The couple is currently undergoing treatment at SevenHills Hospital and have not got any major symptoms. 

“I have been thinking about it almost every moment. How did she get the infection? None of us has travelled abroad or ventured out, barring a few occasions to buy essentials. My children are also young,” said the 48-year-old son, adding their positive reports arrived a day after her demise, leaving them with little time to grieve. “We were asked to immediately get admitted to a hospital,” he said. 

“However, we got a lot of support from the BMC in terms of testing and finding a hospital bed,” he said.

After the centenarian developed cough and weakness on April 3, the son admitted her to Brahman Sabha Hospital in Girgaum. 

“Though she didn’t have fever, I insisted that she should be tested for coronavirus, and the report came positive on Monday. The same day she passed away,” the son said, adding that unlike what he had heard about other coronavirus victims, he did not face any problems carrying out her final rites. 

Physician Dr Sanjay Godbole said the woman’s right lung was fibrotic and she was malnourished. “She had a history of tuberculosis. A day prior to coming to Brahman Sabha Hospital, they had gone to another hospital where she was put on IV drip,” he said, adding it would be difficult to point to a source of infection. “We have also inquired if anybody who had travelled to Nizamuddin had visited them. They have denied that,” he said. 

Following her positive report, they had shut down the hospital and quarantined around 55 staffers. 

“Their samples have been taken,” said the doctor.
