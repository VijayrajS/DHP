Ranchi: Jharkhand on Friday recorded 49 fresh cases of Covid-19, a dip of more than 50% than earlier figures for the second consecutive day. Authorities of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) were also relieved as two of its intern doctors, who had tested positive for the viral infection June 2, recovered and were discharged on Friday afternoon.

The total number of cases in the state has now risen to 1,657; of which 964 are active cases while 693 have recovered and eight have succumbed to the viral infection.

Rims director Dr D K Singh said, “It is definitely good news for us as two of our young doctors have recovered and have been discharged from the Covid ward. We are also pleased to inform that samples of all 24 others who had come in contact with the two doctors have tested negative. The intern doctors, who were discharged, will soon join us in the fight against the pandemic.”

Of the total cases detected on Friday, Gumla district reported the maximum number of cases with 19 followed by Palamu with seven cases. Ramgarh, East and West Singhbhum reported four cases each and Ranchi, Simdega and Chatra reported three cases each. Latehar reported two fresh cases.

In Ranchi, all three cases were detected from Rims but the hospital’s health workers said the new cases didn’t affect the hospital’s operation as the patients were already in the isolation ward after their contact tracing exercise. “All three new cases on Friday are family members of those who were detected positive three days ago from neurosurgery and general surgery departments,” a Rims official said. 

Friday’s dip in the cases has come as a relief for health authorities in the state, which has recorded a total of 764 cases in the last seven days, a figure which accounted for nearly 46% of the total cases detected in Jharkhand since the outbreak of the viral infection on March 31.
