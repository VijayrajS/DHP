2020-03-29
Kolhapur: The civic administration has decided to put all the people who have returned from abroad or from the cities which have reported a high number of confirmed coronavirus cases in institutional quarantine till the 21-day lockdown period ends. As many as 210 people have been identified who will be put in institutional quarantine.The decision was taken after the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) found, during its survey, that many people were hiding details of their travel history.The first confirmed coronavirus case was reported from Mangalwar Peth area of the city. According to municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti, a man recently returned from Pune to Kolhapur before the lockdown was announced last week. He neither turned up for the screening conducted by the administration, nor did he divulge his travel details to the authorities. The man’s swab sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), in Pune on Wednesday. The results declared on Thursday revealed that he tested positive for the contagion. He is currently undergoing treatment in institutional quarantine. “We will bring all the people who have come from abroad or from high-risk cities under institutional quarantine. They will be looked after by our health staff. We have already set up beds in our hospitals. Now, many private hospitals have also offered their infrastructure for institutional quarantine,” said Kalshetti.Hoteliers too are ready to provide rooms for the quarantine process. Kalshetti has given the option to the concerned people to either stay in institutional quarantine or confine themselves to the rooms identified in various hotels. “The hotels will take a nominal charge. All that they (identified people) have to do is not move out or come in contact with others. Their hands will be stamped with the number of days they have to be in quarantine,” said the civic chief. Meanwhile, several complaints are emerging from the area where the confirmed case has been reported, which has been earmarked following the identification of the case. Locals claimed they have not been allowed to step out of their houses or societies to buy milk and other daily essentials.30 people from the housing society, where the first case has been reported, have been compulsorily put in home-quarantine as they came in contact with the confirmed patient. Kalshetti said that five relatives of the patient, whose swab samples have been sent for testing, have been put in institutional quarantine. “We have set up teams under local corporators to look into the concerns of the people in their wards. We have provided the details of the local grocers after consulting with the retailers. Only thing people have to do is to dial them and the essentials will reach their doorstep,” said Kalshetti.
