Covid-19 in Odisha: Auto-rickshaws drivers wear mask, keep handwash
2020-03-19
BHUBANESWAR: To ensure safety of passengers travelling in auto-rickshaws from Covid-19, auto drivers are keeping handwash bottles in their vehicles and wearing masks. The All Odisha Auto-rickshaw Association has requested the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation to provide water facilities at auto stands so that drivers can wash their hands frequently. 


“All are concerned about their health. So we are all cooperating. But we need support from the government and passengers to maintain sanitation. We advised our drivers to keep their vehicles clean and wear masks and gloves. Some have also kept hand wash and water to wash their hands frequently,” said Padman Kumar Samal, secretary of the auto-rickshaw association. He said 30,000 registered auto-rickshaws are plying in the city. 

Despite all the precautionary and sanitation measures, the auto-rickshaw drivers are worried about the sudden fall in their earnings as large number of people are avoiding commuting. The association has also requested auto-rickshaw drivers to move to their villages instead of staying in big urban centres.

People are not ready to sit close to each other in auto-rickshaws for fear of infection. “So we are taking only two passengers at a time instead of four or five we used to take earlier. It has affected our income. Besides, very few people are coming out of their homes,” said Manas Pradhan, a visibly worried driver.
