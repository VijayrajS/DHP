2020-03-18
MEERUT: With a fresh batch of 131 people coming from abroad to Meerut, the health department is on its toes to identify the new travellers apart from the 37 who have already been tracked and are being monitored for any symptoms related to coronavirus.


According to health department officials, the most sensitive travellers are the ones coming from eight countries -- China, France, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Iran and Germany. The officials will stay in touch with the people concerned to keep a track of whether they show symptoms of any sort.

“As many as 37 travellers were already under surveillance. However, with 131 new people coming from abroad, the number of people under surveillance will increase. We are in the process of identifying the travellers and will give a number once the process is complete. All these travellers will be tracked for any symptoms for 14 days to ensure that they do not have the disease. They will also be asked to remain at their homes to prevent any spread of infection,” said Dr Vishwas Chaudhary, Meerut district surveillance officer.

This comes at a time when all the suspected samples sent from Meerut have tested negative for the disease. “The locals should maintain good hygiene, clean their hands as frequently as possible and not touch their face repeatedly. People should not panic and rather take steps to contain the disease,” said Dr Chaudhary.

He further advised that one should mix one litre water with 15 grams of bleaching powder and use it as a disinfectant to clean table tops, floors, door knobs and other places.
