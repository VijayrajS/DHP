2020-04-27
Madurai: Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam conducted inspections in Bodinaickanur, Chinnamanur, Cumbum and Gudalur in on Sunday while taking stock of Covid-19 prevention measures in Theni district. He interacted with the local body, health and police officials involved in prevention works. 

However, he created a flutter when he said during a review meeting that it was a good sign that no positive cases were reported in the district in the past 11 days, when actually, it was only nine days since the last case was reported on April 17. It is unclear whether it was a slip of the tongue from the minister or officials had given him the wrong figures. 

OPS urged the officials to ensure that enforcement measures of the lockdown are implemented fully, but also to be compassionate towards the needs of the people. He has also arranged special ambulances in the eight blocks in the district to help pregnant women reach hospital after he was informed that two women were harassed and made to walk long distances by the police. The deputy CM distributed four lakh masks from his own funds to the frontline workers, while his son and Theni MP P Ravindranath Kumar gave away a vehicle for disinfection to the district from his funds for the purpose. The 600 litre capacity tractor costing Rs 11 lakh has 12 nozzles for spraying disinfectants.
