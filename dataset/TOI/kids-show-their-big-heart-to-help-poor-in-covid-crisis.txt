Surat: In these difficult times, little children from the state are showing their big hearts by donating money to the government from their piggy banks.Five-year-old, Paris Vyas from Ankleshwar, has become a source of inspiration for charity to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and help the poor affected due to the lockdown.Paris donated Rs 11,200 from her piggy bank savings for the relief of the poor people affected due to the lockdown in the state.In a small video that went viral a couple of days ago, Paris holding her decorative piggy bank was seen appealing people to donate generously for the poor.Talking to TOI, Paris said, “Poor people are not getting food to eat, so I decided to donate my piggy bank saving. I am also requesting other people and children to donate their savings to help poor people”In the video, she is heard saying, “I am giving whatever I have in my piggy bank to the government so that they can help the poor people and fight against corona. Like me, you also come forward to help the government to fight corona.”Paris’ father, OM Vyas, who owns a chemical unit in Ankleshwar said, “My daughter was inspired seeing tycoons like Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani donating huge amounts to the PM-CARES fund. She came to me with her piggy bank and asked me to donate it to the government.”Vyas added, “I can transfer the amount online to the PM-CARES fund, but I want to donate her piggy bank to the district collector in Bharuch. Since there is a lockdown, I am trying to get permission from the police to meet the district collector in Bharuch and hand over the piggy bank as donation.”According to Vyas, many of his daughter’s classmate at the Little Flower School have come forward to donate their piggy bank money. Three brothers, aged between four and 10 years, walked into a police station in Ahmedabad with their piggy banks as they wanted to contribute in city police's efforts to feed the poor, homeless and migrant workers.In a video shared by the Ahmedabad police on its Twitter handle, the three brothers are seen walking into the premises accompanied by their mother.“Heartfelt thank you to Zaid, Moin and Amen, who donated Rs 5,500 from their piggy banks after their mother showed them the relief work being done by us. “We are extremely pleased by the kind gesture of these kids,” said the police in a tweet on Wednesday.
