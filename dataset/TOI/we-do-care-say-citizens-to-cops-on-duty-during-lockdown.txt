We do care, say citizens to cops on duty during lockdown
2020-03-24
Nashik: Consistent hard work by police personnel in tough times, like curfews and other bandobast duties, generally goes unnoticed. However, a gesture by a group of citizens offered some solace to cops on duty during the current lockdown and Sunday’s “janata curfew” in view of the coronavirus fear.

Since food joints are closed in various areas of the city, this group of citizens took up responsibility to make sure that the warriors in the frontline to fight the novel coronavirus are offered water, snacks or food.

Harpreet Singh Basoor and Nuruddin Batliwala, astride a two-wheeler, were among those seen distributing packaged drinking water among policemen.“The days are getting hotter and these policemen are on duty without worrying about themselves. They have to run around in the scorching sun to stop overcrowding in the streets so that citizens can be safe from the fast spreading coronavirus,” said Basoor. 

Ravindra Deo, a retired medical professional, saw a group of traffic police deployed in the Dwarka area on Sunday. Hotels and restaurants were closed that day due to the “janata curfew”. Around 10.30 am, he brought tea and biscuits and offered them to the traffic cops. 

“Around 10 police personnel were working since morning. My son-in-law and I thought of giving them at least tea and biscuits as no shop was open in the area. It was immense pleasure to see them happy. They looked relieved of the work pressure for a while,” Deo told TOI.

Deo also went to Dwarka Circle on Monday and served tea to policemen on duty there. “I went out at 6am with tea in a flask as they were working since last night without having anything. At least that much I could do for them,” he added.

One person was seen serving biryani to cops at Sarda Circle.
