2020-05-31
BATHINDA: The power connections of five people who flouted home-quarantine norms have been disconnected on the orders of the Muktsar district administration, while show-cause notices have been issued to 67 violators asking why power should not be discontinued to their residences. 


Muktsar additional deputy commissioner Sandeep Kumar said this action has been initiated after all entreaties to people flouting home quarantine norms went unheeded. "Out of the 67 persons who have violated protocol, 13 are from Muktsar sub division, 16 from Malout sub division and 38 from Giddarbaha sub division. The district police have also been asked to initiate legal action against those persons," he said. 

As per the order issued on Friday, the state health department has imposed a fine of Rs 2,000 on all people who violate quarantine norms.

According to new Punjab government guidelines, all domestic travellers entering Punjab who are found asymptomatic or test negative will have to remain under home quarantine for 14 days. International passengers who test negative also have to remain under home quarantine for 7 days after mandatory stay at paid institutional quarantine centres.
