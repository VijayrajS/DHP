PUNE: Far from the usual high-octane activities, a large tin shed housing the decorative items of an event organizing firm near Pashan-Sus Road looks all desolate and bereft now, with four workers still occupying it desperately waiting for the lockdown to get over.


Seated amidst king-size masks, artificial trees, colourful cotton tents placed in large stainless steel containers, Sooraj Vegle and Shyam Tadhawale from Madhya Pradesh spend time listening to music on their make-shift home theatre music system. 

“We had got the last decoration order on February 15,” Vegle recalled, adding “I don’t know when will we start getting orders again. Due to Covid-19, it appears that people have locked themselves in their homes and have stopped partying.”

As of now, food, stay and monthly payments have not been a problem for the workers. They, however, have doubts about their finances in the future. 

“We had decided to go back home. But, had to stay back as lockdown was implemented. So, now we are stuck here,” said Tadhawale. 

Most of Tadhawale’s co-workers left for their home towns much before the lockdown. Though, he is kind of comfortable staying at the tin shed, it’s the longing to meet his family members that bothers him a lot. 

As the day progresses, the heat engulfs the tin shed, prompting the workers to look for a cold corner. “We are just waiting for the customers and orders to get back to work. Creativity is my passion. Initially, I utilized time giving finishing touches to one of our installations. However, with no new orders, I’m just killing time listening to news and waiting for the lockdown to end,” Tadhawale said.

The long narrow passage outside the shed bears different expressions of joker masks. Due to Covid-19, these masks have been kept in a stash, as if waiting for good times to arrive and decorate the walls for yet another event.
