2020-05-23
NEW DELHI: Fresh Covid-19 cases in Delhi touched another new peak on Friday, the fourth in as many days, with 660 infections added to the city’s virus count, which crossed the 12,000 mark.


With this, 2,263 infections have been recorded in the past four days, more than a third of the 6,214 active cases in the city, indicating a surge in infections. The city’s death toll crossed 200, with 14 fatalities reported in Friday, taking the total to 208.

Epidemiologists predict there may be a further rise in cases over the next few days, as the epidemic curve of Covid-19 in Delhi is still rising.

Delhi has so far recorded 12,319 Covid-19 cases, the fourth highest in the country after Maharashtra (44,582), Tamil Nadu (14,753) and Gujarat (13,273). On the brighter side, 5,897 patients (48%) have recovered from the disease.

Need to scale up health infra to avoid crisis: Docs

A doctor at a private hospital designated for Covid-19 treatment said the city urgently requires more isolation beds for the rush of new cases.

“In India, the fatality rate is much lower compared to other countries affected by the pandemic. But we cannot be complacent. The health infrastructure dedicated for the care of persons developing complications on contracting Covid-19 has to be scaled up further to prevent a crisis situation. We need to arrange for more isolation beds, oxygen support system and ventilators,” the doctor said.

He added that already they were facing a shortage of beds due to which many suspected as well as positive patients cannot be admitted. Delhi has 14 hospitals designated for Covid-19 treatment.

Of these, Lok Nayak and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty are state-run, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML), Safdarjung and AIIMS (Delhi and Jhajjar) are run by the Centre. Eight others are private hospitals. Among these are Max Smart, Apollo, Sir Ganga Ram Kolmet and Sir Ganga Ram City, Maa Durga Charitable Trust, Batra, Fortis Shalimar Bagh and Cygnus hospital.

As per government’s data, Delhi has 6,214 active cases of Covid-19 at present. Of these, 1,835 (30%) are admitted in hospitals – 1,348 in government hospitals and 487 in private ones. A total of 196 patients have severe symptoms and complications associated with Covid-19 due to which they either require ICU support or ventilators.

“If the number of cases continues to go up, more hospitals will have to be designated for Covid-19 treatment. Also, like in Mumbai, some standardisation of money charged for treatment in private facilities is needed,” a doctor said. Maharashtra, which is worst affected by the Covid-19 epidemic with over 44,000 cases and 1517 deaths, on Thursday issued a revised notification to cap treatment charges for Covid-19 and nearly 200 non-Covid procedures in private hospitals.

As per the order, the capped rates will apply to 80% of hospital beds, while the management can charge their own prices for the remaining 20%. The price capping will stay in effect till August 31. Under the ceiling, no hospital can charge a Covid-19 patient more than Rs 9,000 per day for an ICU bed with ventilator, Rs 7,500 for an ICU bed without ventilator and Rs 4,000 for isolation in a routine ward.

“Nearly 20% of Covid-19 patients have severe symptoms which require medical monitoring. For this, a majority of patients require admission, especially those with preexisting illnesses and complications like breathing difficulty,” a doctor said.
