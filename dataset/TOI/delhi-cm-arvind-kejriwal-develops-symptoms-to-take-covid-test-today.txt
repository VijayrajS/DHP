NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has developed Covid-like symptoms and will undergo test for novel coronavirus. After developing mild fever and sore throat, he has cancelled all meetings since Sunday and gone into self-isolation. 


“The chief minster started feeling down since Sunday afternoon. He has fever and pain in the throat. He has put himself into self-isolation at his residence. All meetings have been cancelled since Sunday. He will undergo Covid test on Tuesday,” AAP MP Sanjay Singh said. 

As Kejriwal has a medical history of diabetes for a long time, doctors have advised him to avoid meetings and stay isolated, Singh said. “I pray to God that everything is fine and he recovers very fast and returns to work,” he added. 

During the complete lockdown, Kejriwal mostly worked from home and also attended various meetings through videoconferencing before returning to the secretariat on a regular basis following the relaxations. Not only Aam Aadmi Party functionaries but also several members of the opposition BJP and Congress have wished him a speedy recovery. 

In the meantime, three staff at the office of the North district magistrate have tested positive for novel coronavirus, prompting an extensive sanitisation exercise. But all of them are without any major symptom and under home isolation. A contact tracing will be undertaken and “all those with Covid symptoms will be tested”, said an official.
