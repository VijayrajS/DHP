Madurai: As the number of Covid-19 positive cases continues to rise, apprehensive public now turn to traditional method to fight off the deadly epidemic. 

Many households in Sellur here have hung bunches of neem leaves at the door, hoping that their healing properties could work wonders for them.

“When there is an illness in the community, we usually use neem leaves for its curative properties. It serves as a warning to others that there is someone in the house with an infectious disease,’’ K Ramasamy of Sellur says.

“Even now, when children catch measles or chickenpox, we use neem leaves to treat them. It has a lot of healing properties,’’ says Sandanam of Sellur.

The public believe in the healing powers of the neem leaves which are often seen outside almost every house in the area. Usually, women walk out to pluck the leaves early in the morning. “We have been doing it over the past few days. Now as most low-hanging branches have shed their leaves, men have to go out to pick them,’’ says A Selvi a resident.

Even inhaling the air from under neem tree has healing powers, Selvi says, adding that some people even started searching for saplings so they can grow them in their homes. 

Many neem trees in Madurai are flowering now, and saplings would start arriving only after nearly six months, says Thirupathi a resident.
