Unorganised sector bears the brunt of lockdown
2020-03-23
Aurangabad: The ongoing coronavirus scare and the imposition of section 144 till March 31 have hit thousands of workers in the unorganized sectors, autorickshaw drivers, handcart pullers, porters, hawkers, domestic and farm workers hard.

Anticipating the tough times ahead for several lakhs of workers in the drought-prone Marathwada region, activists said that even if these people survive the coronavirus, they may die of hunger.

On the instructions of the state government, the state labour commissioner has already issued directives to the private employers asking them to neither cut salaries not fire their employees.

On Sunday, none of the workers gathered at the spots where they usually come looking for work. The region has more than 50,000 autorickshaws, and they too have gone off the roads, affecting an equal number of families directly dependent on them. The activists working for the unorganised sector, fear that it would be impossible for the poor to sustain the restrictions, stretching up to 8 days at a time.

Maharashtra Rajya Hamal Mapadi Mahamandal general secretary Subhash Lomte, who has been fighting for the cause of unorganized workers for decades, demanded immediate measures for workers, domestic helps and farm workers. Almost 93% of the workforce in India is in the unorganised sector. They include porters and other workers directly or indirectly connected with essential services. The district administration and the state should immediately initiate measures to address their problems. Health check-ups of the workers should be carried out.”

 CPI district joint secretary Abhay Taksal said, “The state government is doing a good job, but considering the situation we are facing, these steps are not enough.” He demanded special packages, apart from unemployment wage.
