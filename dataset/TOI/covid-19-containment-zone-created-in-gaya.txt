GAYA: A containment zone has been created in the Gurudwara Road locality of Gaya town following Covid-19 protocol.

The zone was created after a woman tested positive report on Wednesday. An estimated 300 houses fall in the area notified by the district administration and both the entry and exit points of the zone have been sealed. Police have been deputed to execute the ban order. 

On Wednesday evening, a woman in her early forties with an international travel history, tested Covid-19 positive and she was immediately shifted to ANMMCH. The area of the containment zone has been fixed considering her house as the epicentre. According to a press release issued by NK Gupta, deputy director, public relations department on Thursday, “All nine members of the woman’s family have been evacuated and put in the isolation ward. Sample of all the nine persons have been collected and sent for test in a Patna-based virology lab.”

The infected woman had reached Gaya on March 22, by an Air India (AI 433) Delhi-Gaya flight. On its return journey, the same flight has a stopover in Varanasi. Asked whether everybody in the sealed area will be tested, the DM said that as of now only those who came in direct contact of the Covid positive woman would be tested. Others may be tested only if they develop Covid-like symptoms.

As part of the containment zone protocol, each and every house has been sanitised with disinfectants and all people living in those houses will remain under home quarantine for 14 days beginning Thursday. Earlier, the district administration also sealed the Paharpur area on the southern outskirts of the town, from where the first Covid case was reported.
