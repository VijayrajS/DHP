TRICHY: District collector S Sivarasu inspected the ongoing precautionary measures taken up by the Trichy Corporation and Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) at the Central bus stand on Monday evening.


The bus crew were told to report the passengers displaying symptoms of Covid-19 to the information centres established at the bus stand, which in turn will alert the health department officials.

With more than 2,000 bus services per day, more than one lakh passengers visit the Central bus stand here. As precautionary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 are under way across the state, the civic body has been spraying disinfectant in the corridors and pillars of the bus terminus.

Similarly, TNSTC has been cleaning the buses and applying disinfectants in the buses across five depots here. 

Supervising the work and promoting awareness among the bus crew members, the collector encouraged the TNSTC employees to keep a watch on people showing symptoms of Covid-19 for providing medical attention. 

The corporation said that a team of 20 sanitary workers are constantly stationed at the bus terminus to spray the disinfectants near buses and chairs.
