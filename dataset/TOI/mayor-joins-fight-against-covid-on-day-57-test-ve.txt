SURAT: Surat mayor, Dr Jagdish Patel joined fight against Covid-19 by offering his service at civic body-run SMIMER hospital, even as 57 more tested positive for the deadly virus on Wednesday. With this the total number cases in the city rose to 390.

Health officials said that majority of the new cases were detected during the community sampling drive in Katargam and Limbayat zones respectively.

Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) Banchhanidhi Pani appreciated Dr Patel’s gesture in offering service to fight the pandemic. Pani also appealed to people to maintain social distancing even after the curfew in the red zones ends on April 24.

“As curfew is going to end on April 24 in Limbayat and Central zone and Ramadam is starting from the same day, I appeal to people to take precautions and maintain social distancing and not gather at one place,” said Pani. “Unfortunately, we still have to penalize people for not wearing face masks and not maintain social distancing. We have to make it a way of life in view of Covid-19,''Pani said. 

“We are procuring yellow dustbins wherein people can dispose of face masks. We are launching a campaign for hand wash in the city and its a community effort to win a war against the virus,” he informed.
