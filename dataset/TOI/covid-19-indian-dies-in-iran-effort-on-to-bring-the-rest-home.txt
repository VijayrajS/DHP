2020-03-20
NEW DELHI: E ven as the government confirmed one Indian death in Iran from Covid-19, MEA additional secretary Dammu Ravi said diplomats and staff of the Indian embassy in Iran had been tested as a precautionary measure and found negative. 

A sserting that the Indian ambassador to Iran, Gaddam Dharmendra, was in full control, Ravi said a "wellness" facility had been commandeered in Qom where the positive tested Indians were being cared for. Ravi said India was focusing on bringing people back from Iran. At some stage, he said, the government hoped that those who tested positive would have recovered enough to be brought back. 

T he PM, he said, was monitoring the situation on a regular basis. Both the MEA and the bureau of immigration have set up 24/7 helplines to assist those in distress, with separate people handling issues from specific countries. "We're increasing the number of people in the control room." 

Ravi said the Indian medical team had brought back 380 samples from Italy, out of which 376 were negative and four positive. While the embassy had set up a testing centre in Rome, the lockdown had made it difficult to get the team to Milan in Lombardy. 

A cknowledging two pressing issues - of students left stranded by airlines at airports and the difficulty of getting medical certificates - Ravi said these were being addressed by and by.
