Coronavirus scare: Testing time for family after neighbours panic
2020-02-01
BENGALURU: A family of five living in a Bannerghatta Road flat is in the eye of the coronavirus scare gripping the city. The family had recently visited China, raising concerns among other dwellers of their apartment complex. 

Following an alert sounded by the apartment residents, a team of doctors from the health and family welfare department visited the complex on Thursday night, but the family was not willing to meet them and shut their doors on the visitors. 

On Friday, an ambulance with staffers was sent to counsel the family and take them for testing. The family finally agreed and went to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD).

“They had not travelled to Wuhan, but to another province in China. They returned on January 23 and were screened at the airport too. On Friday, as a precautionary measure, their sputum and blood samples were taken for testing. They don’t have fever or respiratory infection. One of them has gastrointestinal issues,” said Dr Deepak UG, nodal officer, coronavirus isolation ward at RGICD.

Meanwhile, 12 people with travel history to China have tested negative for coronavirus. Only one man’s test results are awaited. He is the only patient in the isolation ward of RGICD.


Testing only at govt labs

While the government has chosen four private hospitals in Bengaluru for admission of suspected persons with travel history to China, their blood and sputum samples will have to be sent to government-run labs. 

A lab at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) and a branch of National Institute of Virology located near RGICD are the only two authorised for testing.
