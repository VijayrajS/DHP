Vijayawada: Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers in Krishna district have submitted a representation to district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz requesting him to consider problems at the ground-level in handling suspected Covid-19 patients.

The state government is utilising the services of village volunteers, health secretaries and Asha workers to identify foreign returnees and home quarantine them. 

Stating that the district health department has ignored their needs, Asha workers said they were not provided with masks, sanitizers, gloves and other safety gear. “There are around 3,000 Asha workers in Krishna district. We are going door-to-door and handling the Covid-19 suspect patients. Officials are ignoring our safety. We are buying our own hand sanitizers and other safety gear to prevent the transmission. We have requested the district medical and health officials on this, but there is no response,” said A Kamala, general secretary of Asha workers’ union.

Kamala also requested the district collector to provide free transport within the city as Asha workers were facing problems in travelling with the lockdown.

Speaking to TOI, the district collector said the administration will be responsive to the demands raised by Asha workers. “Field-level staff are top priority for us. We have come to know that they are facing a problem with the shortage of masks. I have ordered the health wing officials to provide masks and gloves immediately,” Imtiaz said.
