INDORE: A sub-inspector posted in RPF police station in Khandwa district, who was admitted at a hospital in Indore, lost his life battling Covid-19 on Sunday. 

Officials said that sub-inspector Ramapati Pandey and his son’s samples were collected on May 18 in which the son was tested positive whereas Pandey’s report was yet to arrive. While the son was kept in isolation ward in district hospital, the SI was not admitted. It was only after his condition started deteriorating that he was admitted to hospital in Khandwa on Saturday and was rushed to Indore, where he succumbed on Sunday. 

RPF inspector Mahendra Khoja said that SI Pandey had taken leave on May 13 after he faced breathing difficulties. 

His oxygen saturation in blood was 40% when he was brought to Indore and after being kept on BiPAP, it increased to 80% but he couldn’t survive, said doctors. Meanwhile, two police officials were tested positive at GRP station in Indore. They were among a dozen other police officials who were tested recently. “We had over 150 officials tested of which two including a constable and an ASI were tested positive. After the Indore-Rewa special train was started, we had a feeling that there must have been some spread and so to be cautious, the tests were conducted,” said Gayatri Soni, GRP inspector.
