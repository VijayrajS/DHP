HYDERABAD: Startups and small scale industries are the worst hit due to Covid-19 lockdown. 


A recent survey by Local Circles revealed that 47% of Indian startups and small scale industries are having limited cash reserves which can fend them only for a few days.

Around 74% startups and SMEs are either staring at a shutdown or planning to scale down their operations in the next six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected business across the nation.. 

Akshay Gupta of Local Circles said, “Startups, SMEs and industry associations are seeking government’s help to wriggle out of this crisis. Our survey received over 13,970 responses from startups and SMEs located in about 90 districts.”

“Queried about their cash reserves, 6% said they can manage for six months, 23% have reserves for three to six months and 24% said they can survive for one to three months,” Akshay Gupta added.

“But about 20% of startups have cash to survive only for a month while 27% have no funds,” he said.

Startups are demanding the government to reimburse 50% of employee salaries for one month or give a grant of Rs 20 lakh. 

About 61% are planning to scale down their business, 7% are planning to sell their units and 13% want to shut down completely. However, 13% sounded optimistic and are looking to expand their business.
