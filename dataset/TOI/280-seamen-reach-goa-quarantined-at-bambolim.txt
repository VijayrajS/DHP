Panaji: A Qatar Airways chartered flight arrived at Goa International Airport on Saturday morning with 280 stranded seafarers who were employed with P&O cruises. The flight departed from London and had a stopover at Doha. The Goan seafarers have been put up at Bambolim Beach Resort and are expected to be tested on Sunday or on Monday, officials said.

The seafarers were stranded in London for over 60 days and had tested negative before they boarded the flight for Goa but will be tested again as per the state government’s protocol. 

“Early Saturday morning Qatar Airways, the 11th repatriation flight, brought in 280 stranded seafarers from London to Goa via Doha,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said. The passengers were screened by directorate of health services and then allowed to board special KTC buses that were deployed to take them to the resort at Bambolim. 

“Their tests are expected to be taken either on Sunday or Monday after which they will have to wait for another two to three days for the results before they are sent home,” nodal officer for repatriating Goans P S Reddy said. 

Three more flights are expected to arrive at Goa International Airport in the coming days with crew that used to work on vessels operated by P&O Cruises, a British cruise line owned by Carnival Corporation.

Interestingly, the government has yet to test the seafarers who had arrived a few days earlier and who have been put up at various hotels in Vasco. “With the coronavirus spreading in Mangor Hill and other parts of Goa, the department does not have staff to test the boys. They want the boys to go to Margao for tests,” Goa Seamen Association of India founder president Dixon Vaz said.
