MADURAI: Even as the world sees a surge of cruelties, a 50-year-old man proves that there is still room for compassion by feeding dogs left in the lurch after the deadly Corona virus forced many into lockdown.


K P Marikumar, of Mahatma Gandhi Nagar, ensures that while the homeless people are taken care of by various NGOs, his canine friends should not starve to death on the street during this difficult time.

He starts his day at 5 am by preparing food and carry it to a stretch between his house and Pandikovil, an area located 9 km from his house, where a good number of dogs await him. He has been doing this for the past four years, but this time he decided to feed more number of dogs as the curfew left them hungry.

He also takes care of at least 30 dogs in his house and on his office premises and has a helper from his friend who lends him a car for the job. “Rice is boiled with milk and egg to make nutritious food. Apart from food, we carry water. Many dogs first drink water before they eat food. It shows that they are deprived of water,” he said.

Marikumar, who runs a coaching centre for competitive exams to benefit the underprivileged, turned dog feeder four years ago. However, his kindly act was often greeted with contempt and ridicule by residents who thought feeding dogs would only help the canine population swell.

Despite the criticisms, Maikumar stood for animal welfare and spread awareness about helping the helpless. He then started taking care of abandoned dogs on his office premises. “It all started with one dog, soon many dogs came in search of shelter and I could not shun them,” he said.

With food sources dwindling during lockdown, he has urged people to keep water and food or at least one stray dog. “When we step out to feed dogs, we come across many dogs that are abandoned by their callous owners. Abandoning pets at this time is the worst thing to do,” he said.
