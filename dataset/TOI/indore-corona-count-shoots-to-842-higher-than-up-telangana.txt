2020-04-17
INDORE/BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh was hit by an avalanche of 361 Covid-19 cases on Thursday – with Indore alone accounting for 244 of them. MP's was the highest tally of the day in the entire country, with Maharashtra coming second at 286.

MP’s corona count rocketed to 1,299 – putting it at third place in the country, behind only Maharashtra and Delhi. It has more than doubled in the last three days; the tally was 614 on April 13.

Indore’s count is now a whopping 842 – higher than all of Uttar Pradesh, a state with nearly 80 times its population. Indore also reported the maximum Covid-19 deaths in day – eight were added to the city’s toll, taking it to 47, and the state’s to 63. Fifteen of Indore’s patients are in critical condition.

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan sought to reassure people, saying: “The spurt in Indore and Bhopal is not a matter of great concern because earlier there was no testing, which led to spread of the disease. “

“People in Indore started dying of coronavirus infection in March, which means the infection was there but patients were not tested and treated because there were no facilities. Since March 23, there had been no test for Coronavirus in the state. Now that tests are taking place, patients are being detected and treated. There is a good sign that the maximum number of patients are responding to treatment and returning home after cure,” he said in a statement. 

The CM admitted that there has been a “delay in attempts to tackle the menace”, but now the state government is working on a war footing to contain the pandemic. “The number of covid-positive patients seems to be higher, but they are among those people already in quarantine,” said ACS-health Mohammed Suleman.
