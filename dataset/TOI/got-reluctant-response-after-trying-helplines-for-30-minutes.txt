The response on the Covid-19 helplines was appalling, and the entire process was time-consuming. I first tried the Delhi helpline 011-22307145 several times — 11 times over 32 minutes — 4.31- 5.03pm on March 15. It was busy each time, after which it kept ringing but no one picked up.

In between, I tried the national helpline 011-23978046 four times too. On the fifth ring, they finally picked up. The person at the other end first told me it’s a coronavirus helpline, then took nearly five minutes to jot down, very slowly, where I was calling from, my name and number, and asked me what my ‘samasya’ (problem) was.

This seemed unnecessary, as he couldn’t have done anything about it except redirecting, but I anyway told him about the fever and cough. He gave me two numbers, one of DSO Dr Pankaj Prasad, and another doctor, Dr Abha Rani. In all this, there was no sense of any urgency at all. I then tried the two numbers some six to seven times, and they were busy as well.

I finally asked for my doctor’s advice again on what to do, as testing is what he had suggested in the first place. As only RML and Safdarjung hospitals seem to be testing right now — it seems sorely inadequate — I was advised caution about the overcrowded hospitals and to wait and watch.
