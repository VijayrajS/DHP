Jaipur: Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has accused the state government of not implementing the lockdown effectively in the state.

In a press conference held over video conferencing on Saturday, Shekhawat expressed his concern over the rising number of cases in Jaipur and Jodhpur. He demanded that central reserve forces take over both the cities to control the spread of coronavirus. Jaipur was nearing 900 cases, while Jodhpur with 500 cases are leading the chart in the state. “It appears that the government is not interested in taking measures to stop the spread of coronavirus in Jaipur and Jodhpur. Not implementing the lockdown effectively is the reason behind the surge in cases,” said Shekhawat.

Hitting out at CM Ashok Gehlot over the issue of migrant workers, Shekhawat said the state which has been raising the issue of calling migrant workers back has failed to come up with any concrete plan. “CM Gehlot assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having 4,000 buses ready to bring back migrants while seeking permission for arrival and exit of migrant workers can nowhere be seen,” Shekhawat added.

Accusing the state government of not being able to provide food to the needy, Shekhawat thanked the civil society members and NGOs for reaching out to the areas where the government couldn’t reach.
