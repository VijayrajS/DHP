Meanwhile, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi in a statement stated that Bihar, when compared to developed states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, has very few Covid casualties due to effective measures by the state government. “Recovery rate in Bihar is 48%. But the way migrant labourers are returning in large numbers, people are shifting to their homes after completing quarantine period, markets have opened and buses have started plying, it will be a big challenge to stop the spread of virus in the coming days,” he said.
