Virus paralyses Margao’s pre-monsoon work
2020-04-04
Margao: With hardly two months to go for the monsoon to set in, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have an adverse impact on the pre-monsoon works of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC). As is the practice, the MMC engages a large number of workers during this time of the year for pre-monsoon works to ensure that all the tasks are completed well ahead of the monsoon. This year, however, as the migrant workforce is unlikely to be available for work in view of the lockdown situation as they will be unable to come to Goa, sources in the municipality said that the MMC was mulling engaging local labourers to carry out the works.The pre-monsoon works include cleaning of drains and gutters, desilting of nullahs, cutting and trimming of tree branches, identifying low-lying areas prone to flooding and clearing illegal hutments, preparing plan for accommodating people affected by monsoon calamity, etc.MMC chief officer Ajit Panchwadkar when contacted, acknowledged the scarcity of labourers, but dismissed all concerns. “All pre-monsoon works will be carried out in time. We will soon chalk out a plan of action,” he said.Meanwhile, the director of urban development has issued a circular to all the civic bodies to carry out some of the pre-monsoon works departmentally instead of inviting tenders for the purpose.The civic bodies have also been asked to consider engaging labourers housed in government shelter homes for the tasks.Sources in the MMC, however, expressed apprehensions over engaging labourers from the labour camps. “As it is, none of the labourers housed in the shelter homes are municipality workers. Besides, these labourers earn daily wages anywhere between Rs 600 and 800, whereas the municipality has to pay the wages as per the Minimum Wages Act which is far less. Besides, as they are housed in government shelter homes, engaging them for pre-monsoon works could turn out to be a risky proposition in the event their safety is somehow compromised,” a senior official said.
