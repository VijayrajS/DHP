Visakhapatnam: Coffee cultivation in Araku valley escapes lockdown unscathed
2020-04-19
VISAKHAPATNAM: Coffee plantations in the Araku valley have escaped the brunt of the lockdown imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 as there is no apprehension that production will fall once the lockdown is lifted.


“By the time the lockdown was imposed, the season to pluck the coffee fruit was over. Most farmers had sold their quotas of fruits and those had gone for processing. In no way will the lockdown hamper production of coffee from the valley,” DK Balaji, project officer for the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) told STOI.

Farmers normally pluck the coffee fruit by February or at the latest, in March. The dried fruit is then pulped, roasted and ground to produce the coffee powder. The processing can be done at home and there is no restriction on carrying out this task during the lockdown.

The processed powder is next packaged and sent to retail markets in early June.

The history of Araku Coffee dates back to 1898, when a British official introduced coffee plantations in the valleys of Andhra Pradesh.

 Post-Independence, in 1985, the Girijan Coffee Cooperative Development Corporation (GCCDC) was formed and the cultivation of coffee was taken up on 5,000 acres of plantation land in the Araku valley.

Later, in 1997, employees of GCCDC were deployed to ITDA, which then took up the task of expanding coffee cultivation. At present, coffee is cultivated one one lakh acres in the valley. The lands are maintained by tribal farmers.

“Villagers of around 1,140 villages under 200 gram panchayats are involved in the job of coffee cultivation. It is good that there is no effect on the farmers belonging to poor tribal communities,” said Balu Gadi, who runs an NGO in the Araku region.
