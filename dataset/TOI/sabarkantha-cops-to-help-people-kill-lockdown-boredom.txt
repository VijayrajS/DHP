Sabarkantha cops to help people kill lockdown boredom
2020-03-29
Ahmedabad: While fighting lockdown violators in the streets, harassed cops are also mindful of the fact that staying cooped up inside homes on forced exile is also playing heavily on people’s minds. In order to allay people’s stress and anxieties, the Sabarkantha police have taken an innovative step and organized a slew of indoor activities for the citizens under lockdown.

Organized under the title 'Hoon Corona Killer Chhu' or #CoronaKiller, the activities include various indoor competitions like push-ups, planks, squats, sit-ups, burpee, and yoga besides dancing, handicraft, painting, cooking, and singing too.

A category has been added innovatively, titled ‘helping hand’, for the husbands who are helping their wives with daily household works including cooking. 

Talking to TOI about this initiative, Chaitanya Mandlik, Sabarkantha SP, said, "We want to keep people active inside the safety of their homes during the lockdown period. As we have also started home delivery of all essential items like vegetables, milk, and groceries, they will no longer require to step outside. We have received a very good response to all the competitions, which will be judged by a team of three senior police officials.”

Police in other districts like Amreli, Panchmahal, and Rajkot too plan to replicate Sabarkantha police’s idea. 

 "In the daily contest, winners will be declared daily and essential commodities will be sent to their doorsteps by the Sabarkantha police as prize. That apart, if contestants need essential commodities to be delivered at their homes, the police will help them,” added Mandlik.

The release further said that contestants can WhatsApp their entries through photographs and videos along with their addresses before 8pm to ‘6359626891’ of the Sabarkantha police headquarters. All the winners of the various contests will be awarded and felicitated after the lockdown period is over, cops added.
