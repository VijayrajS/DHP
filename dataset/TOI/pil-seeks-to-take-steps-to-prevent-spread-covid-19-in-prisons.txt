2020-03-25
MADURAI: A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed before the Madras high court seeking to take steps to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in all prisons in the state.


P Thangaraj, coordinator of Prisoners Reform Intervention Support Mission (PRISM), a registered charitable trust which was formed by few advocates to provide free legal services to jail inmates, in his petition stated that following the outbreak of Covid-19, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared it as a pandemic and have asked the people to follow precautionary measures. Though the people have been asked to follow social distancing, the same would be not be possible in the prisons due to overcrowding.

Steps must be taken to address this issue immediately by reducing the arrest and remand of petty offenders and enlarge them on bail in their own bond. Parole of prisoners who are already on parole can be extended and applications for leave could be considered leniently.

The petitioner stated that since prevention is the most vital, prison cells should be sanitised periodically. Hand sanitisers, masks should be made available to the prison staff and inmates who are newly brought inside the prison should be screened. He further stated that quarantine and isolation wards should be provided at the prisons where new admissions must be quarantined for 14 days. Testing kits should also be made available at the hospitals in prisons.

Since the visitors would not be allowed to visit the prisoners, steps should also be taken by the authorities to provide telephones to them for them to speak with their relatives.

The petition is likely to be taken up for hearing soon.
