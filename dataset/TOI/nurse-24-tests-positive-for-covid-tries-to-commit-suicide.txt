GURUGRAM: A 24-year-old nurse working at a private hospital in the city tried to commit suicide in her room on Thursday after her Covid-19 test result came positive. She is under treatment at the hospital.

According to police, the woman lives alone in a rented accommodation in Jharsa. Her test sample was collected on Wednesday after she developed symptoms for the infection. 

On Thursday afternoon, she learned that she has contracted the disease.

Minutes after she hanged herself from the ceiling fan, a woman living in an adjoining room saw her through the window opening into the common corridor. She raised an alarm. Other neighbours came rushing, broke open the door and took the nurse to the hospital. 

ACP (Sadar) Aman Yadav said she was under treatment but shared no other information about her condition. The hospital did not comment. Police said it is not clear what drove her to take this extreme step. “We will get the details only after recording her statement,” said Sadar SHO Naveen Kumar. No case has been registered yet. The nurse is originally from Kerala. 

Tragic reports of people agonising over contracting Covid-19 and killing themselves have emerged from across the country, and even from Gurugram.

On April 29, a 54-year-old man, Satbir Saini, had committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan of his house in Ganga Vihar a day after his wife tested positive for Covid-19. A test conducted on him after his death revealed he was also infected.

Saini’s wife was admitted to a private hospital in Prem Nagar for treatment of an ulcer when she tested positive for Covid-19.
