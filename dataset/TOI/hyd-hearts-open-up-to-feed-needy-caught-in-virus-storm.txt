Hyderabad hearts open up to feed needy caught in coronavirus storm
2020-03-28
HYDERABAD: The coronavirus pandemic may have stopped people from shaking hands but it has not stopped people from lending a helping hand. In one such instance, a city couple have started a kitchen service at their Rajendranagar apartment to feed the homeless and labourers who find themselves stranded in wake of the lockdown.


Aizazuddin, a 43-year-old IT professional and his wife Shehnaaz, cook the food along with the help of their two daughters and deliver the food in an autorickshaw. “We have began supplying food in parcels a few days ago. We serve rice and daal to nearly 150 people every day. As of now, we are bearing the expenditure” Aizaz said.

The couple began surveying slums in their area and in Aramghar almost immediately after PM Narendra Modi announced a nation-wide lockdown.

“We are focusing on feeding the homeless, migrant labourers and are distributing it to different groups every day” Aizaz said. 

“Our security guard helps us in distributing the food. Residents of our apartment are cooperative and understand the effort we are putting in,” says Shehnaaz.

The couple had initially stocked rations for three days. “We want to continue this effort till the lockdown continues but it is becoming difficult for us to obtain the ration. Until now, I had procured it through a wholesaler whom I know,” said Aizaz. 

“Few of our friends who are also engaged in social work support this idea. We will take their help if we find it difficult,” he added. The family also spreads awareness on basic hygiene methods to curb the spread of corona.

The idea of a community kitchen is finding more takers around the city. In Attapur, a group of ten members have started a similar initiative. “We are ten friends working in the same company and have decided to supply meals for 1,000 people every day in and around the Aramghar area,” said Shamiudeen, one of the group’s members.
