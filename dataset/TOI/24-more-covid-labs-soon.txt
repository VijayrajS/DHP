The CM also said that labs in 14 remaining state medical colleges and 18 divisional-level labs should be included in the Laboratory BSL-2. 

Later, principal secretary, medical education, Rajneesh Dubey said: “As many as 10 labs are already undertaking coronavirus testing in the state. In all, they can test 1,350 samples every day.
