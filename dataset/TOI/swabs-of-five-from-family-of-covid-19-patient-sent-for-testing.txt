KOLHAPUR: The civic administration has collected the swab samples of five people from the family of the first confirmed Covid 19 positive case from Kolhapur city.


The Covid-19 patient has travelled to Pune and Mumbai, where cases have earlier been confirmed. He reached Kolhapur before the lockdown was announced last weekend.

Immediately after the test result came in positive, the civic administration took over 25 persons, who were in contact with the patient, for screening.

Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti said, “The health administration has taken swab samples of five from the family for testing. We have requested for immediate testing as they are showing symptoms. We are also tracing other persons, who he was in contact with.”

The positive patient has been at his home since then. However, he may have come in contact with those from the society. The civic health staff is checking with the residents of the society and bringing them for screening.

According to the district administration, the patient must have come in contact with someone already infected as he does not have international travel history. Officials said that none of the people with travel history to infected countries and under home quarantine have reported coronavirus positive.

A senior official of the district administration has said that the rules of quarantine are being followed by each suspect and the persons hiding the symptoms may pose a threat than those under home quarantine.

In addition, the administration is tracing and screening relatives of another Covid-19 patient from Peth Vadgaon, who was in contact with the family from Sangli that has tested positive. The local administration has been asked to conduct a door-to-door survey to find out such people and bring them to Chhatrapati Pramila Raje civil hospital for screening.
