2020-03-09
NEW DELHI: Coronavirus scare has gripped the world. Despite a claimed mortality rate of less than 1% (which is lesser than most of the previous pandemics) there is no denying the spread of the virus from China to several countries in the world. With over 3,000 reported deaths and more than a million people infected, coronavirus has caused widespread panic. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk seem to disagree with all the panic. According to him, the panic over coronavirus is 'dumb'.


 
The coronavirus panic is dumbâ€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1583527359000 
The tech billionaire's comment drew some sarcastic and negative comments from Twitterati. "I really hope it is a joke", "Thank you for stopping it, Elon", "The worries of the poor look dumb to the rich", "Sure is easy to say when u are a billionaire" etc. Some the longer replies to Musk's tweet include "I'm sure it seems like that from SPACE. All you can see is a blue marble with some interchangeable profit centres on it." and "I am the biggest Elon Musk fan and he is so wrong to tweet this, he is probably doing this because he doesn't like how the virus has affected his company revenues etc. he is already successful but guess more money is always more important than lives to people."

There were some who tweeted in defence of Musk's statement, saying that he referred to the panic, not the disease; that he was saying that "the media is being over dramatic with the virus" and it can take lives, only the media is portraying it as world-ending. To which replies of this nature came: "Pretty world ending for those who die from it" and "That doesn't exclude the hysteria about it."
