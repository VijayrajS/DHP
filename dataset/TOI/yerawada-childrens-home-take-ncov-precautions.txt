PUNE: The authorities of the Jawaharlal Nehru Udyog Kendra, a children’s home in Yerawada, have decided to prevent minors who are with them, from coming into contact with coronavirus through contact with outsiders. 


As a preventive measure, the authorities suspended all programmes organised for them.

“We have also obtained 50 masks and sanitizers for the minors and staff members,” superintendent G N Padghan told TOI.

Padghan said the security guards at the outer gate of the home have been told not send any person inside without applying sanitizers.

“We take efforts to reform these boys who are in conflict wit the law so that they can lead a good life after their release. We organise different programmes like meditation, yoga and motivational talks by speakers and we invite many outsiders to the home,” Pagdhan said.

They have stopped these activities for the protection of the children inside the home from Monday.

 “We will continue with these activities once the situation is normal,” Padghan said.

Padghan said he has provided soaps at all barracks in the home. “We have been requesting the inmates to wash their hands regularly. “We have started lodging a limited number of boys in one barrack as a precautionary measure,” he added.

He said the home has a facility of visiting doctors. “These doctors check the inmates regularly. I have also told the staff members that if they noticed an inmate with any symptoms, they should immediately take him to the hospital,” Padghan said. Another official from the Jawaharlal Nehru Udyog Kendra told TOI, “At present there are 33 minor inmates. They have been kept in six barracks inside the home,” he added.
