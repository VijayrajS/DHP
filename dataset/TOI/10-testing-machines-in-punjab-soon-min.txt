CHANDIGARH: To ramp up testing, the Punjab government is all set to establish 10 TrueNat machines at district hospitals, said state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Tuesday. 


He said ICMR had approved TrueNat machins for Covid-19 testing. Special chips would be made available in hospitals where machines would be set up. While five TrueNat machines have been installed at hospitals in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mansa, Barnala and Pathankot, the new 10 will be installed at hospitals in Bathinda, Fazilka, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, Moga, Muktsar, Ropar and Sangrur.

Sidhu said no AC or special bio-safety cabinet was required for TrueNat machines and they could be set up at primary health centres too.
