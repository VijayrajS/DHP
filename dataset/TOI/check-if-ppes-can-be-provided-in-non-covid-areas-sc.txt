Check if PPEs can be provided in non-Covid areas: SC
2020-04-28
Nagpur: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday directed the Central government to examine whether personal protection equipment (PPEs) could be provided to all health officials working in ‘non-Covid treatment areas’.

“We direct the Union of India to examine this issue and make necessary suggestions in the ‘Rational Use of Personal Protective Equipment’ guidelines, so that PPEs are provided to all health officials who are working in non-Covid treatment areas,” a bench comprising justices NV Ramana, Sanjay Kaul and Bhushan Gavai said.

The directives came while the SC was hearing an intervention of city-based doctor Sameer Paltewar through counsels Shreeyash Uday Lalit and Krishna Kumar Singh, via video conferencing.

The intervener sought provision of PPEs to all health workers, including doctors, nurses, ward boys and other medical, paramedical professionals working in all non-Covid treatment areas, contending that Covid-19 infection from asymptomatic patients is on the rise in the country.

While allowing Dr Paltewar’s application, the judges stated that they found substance in his suggestions. “Needless to say that the other directives passed by this court on April 8 are directed to be continued,” the bench said, before disposing of the intervention application.
