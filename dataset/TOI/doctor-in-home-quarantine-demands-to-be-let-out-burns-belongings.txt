ROORKEE: An ayurvedic doctor at a government clinic in Tehri on Monday allegedly burnt some of his belongings, including a motorcycle, out of frustration from being in home quarantine.

The doctor identified as Sushil Kumar had returned to his home in Adarsh Nagar locality, Roorkee on May 12 after being in Tehri and was subsequently home quarantined.

On Monday, Kumar started shouting at his family members and demanded that he be let out of the house and allowed to go to Tehri. His family members called police for help, who managed to bundle him into a car and confine him in a cell at the police station.
