Coronavirus: Private labs can inject life into fight
2020-03-18
NEW DELHI: Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday released guidelines for testing for Covid-19 by private laboratories and requested them to process the tests free of cost. Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR, said the country needed the support of such labs in weathering the crisis posed by the novel coronavirus.


The guidelines state that the test should only be carried out when prescribed by a qualified physician. “ICMR will share the standard operating procedures for laboratory testing and provide positive controls for establishing the test as soon as the private laboratory has procured the primers, probes and reagents,” the guidelines said.

Covid-19 test requires two key agents: primer and probe. Primer is used to hybridise with the sample DNA of the suspect and define the region of DNA to be amplified in the polymerase chain reaction, a testing method. The probe is used to search for the virus DNA sequence. The government labs prepare their own primer while ICMR provides the probes in batches of around 250 per day, depending on the needs, revealed officials.

ICMR said private labs willing to test for free will have to purchase the primers and probes. Some companies are also selling commercial kits with both primer and probe and their results are being validated by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. ICMR said adoption of commercial test kits should be based on NIV validations.

The guidelines said “appropriate biosafety and biosecurity precautions should be ensured while collecting samples” or “alternatively, a disease-specific separate collection site may be created”. Private laboratories are also mandated to ensure immediate/ real-time reporting of test results to ICMR and officials of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme for timely initiation of contact tracing and research activities.

Some private labs held a meeting on Tuesday after which, according to sources, Dr Arvind Lal, owner of Dr Lal Path Labs, wrote to Bhargava expressing willingness to help the government if they were provided the test kits for free along with patients' extracted samples. “We shall also be happy to help via our own CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds, where applicable, provided the government gets us the CSR permission from the competent authorities,” Lal wrote.

The letter said another option would be to fix a reasonable retail price for patients, arrived at with inputs from private labs, as was done during the H1N1 crisis in 2009. Paying patients would then choose the private labs for the test while patients who want a free test can continue going to government labs. Lal’s letter to ICMR added that there also were many companies that would be happy to use their CSR funds and donate to ICMR if the latter expanded testing to private labs and allowed large-scale screening of people.
