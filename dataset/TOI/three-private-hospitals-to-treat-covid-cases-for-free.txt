AHMEDABAD: After a meeting with doctors in the walled city, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided that they should start their clinics, as fever clinics, and AMC will provide PPE kits, masks, gloves and sanitizers for free.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said, “AMC officials had a meeting with doctors operating in the ‘red zone’ areas of Khadia, Jamalpur, Shahpur, Danilimda, Behrampura and Dariapur, and it was decided to start fever clinics in these areas. This will help the corporation find patients with Covid-19 symptoms and treat them immediately.”

The commissioner said that the corporation will not only fumigate such hospitals and clinics but will also provide PPEs, N95 masks, sanitizers and gloves. Nehra further said that a hospital run by Isha Foundation has been converted into a Covid care centre and it will treat patients for free. If required the AMC will provide staff.

Another hospital in Chandkheda, attached to a medical college, will also give free treatment to Covid patients.

The commissioner said that government is in talks with authorities of the Gujarat Cancer Society and their hospital will also soon start treating Covid patients.

Nehra said that Ahmedabad’s case doubling rate is now nine days, from four days earlier. On April 17, there were 557 Covid patients and the number grew to 1,162 on April 20. The April 20 number of 1,162 then doubled on April 29. “We want the case doubling rate to be 11 to 12 days. “Even if the nine-day doubling rate continues, the city will have 15,000 cases by May 15,” said Nehra.

Nehra said that the growth rate of active cases for the past nine days was eight percent and the AMC aims to reduce this to five percent.
