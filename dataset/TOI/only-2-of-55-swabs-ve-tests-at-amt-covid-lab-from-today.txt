Amravati: After seeing an alarming spurt in the number of Covid positive cases in the last three days, the administration as well as citizens heaved some sigh of relief on Sunday as only two of the 55 swab test reports reaching here turned out to be positive, taking the total number of cases to 55.Collector Shailesh Naval, who had on Saturday exhorted people to observe 14-day home quarantine and lauded Hathipura residents for successfully breaking the novel coronavirus chain by strictly following the government instructions, was a relieved man on Sunday. “We received 55 swab reports from the lab and barring two, all other tested negative,” he said.Naval said both the positive cases are women aged 62 and 25 from Kholapuri Gate and Taj Nagar areas, respectively.“Both were institutionally quarantined at Covid Hospital as contacts of previously positive cases from their area and now they have been shifted to Covid-19 ward for treatment,” he said.With today’s one case, the number of Covid cases coming from Kholapuri Gate has entered double digits at 10 — the highest from a single locality. Taj Nagar too increased its tally to seven, the second highest.From March last to date, the health administration has tested 1,529 swabs and 55 of them have tested positive so far, while 1,077 negative. “We are still awaiting reports on 388 samples,” an official said.This wait is likely to get curtailed as the lab at Amravati University is all set to start testing samples from Monday. The AU lab is expected to test 48 reports each day.
