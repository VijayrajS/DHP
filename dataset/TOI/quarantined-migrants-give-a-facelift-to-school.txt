2020-05-03
BAGAHA: A group of 52 migrant workers, who were quarantined in a government middle school here after their return from other states following lockdown, has changed the face of the school by doing wall painting and other beautification work. 


The migrants, who are staying at Government Middle School, Lakshmipur under Bagaha-II block at India-Nepal border, first cleaned the school which was closed for a month and then painted the entire school building with fresh colour coat apart from planting flowers on the campus to give it a new look. Local mukhiya Suman Singh provided the materials to the migrants for the beautification work.

Some of the migrants, residents of Kadhamahawa village, had gone to Nepal to earn livelihood. After they returned from Nepal, the district administration quarantined them in the school as a precautionary measure in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.

Later, the migrants voluntarily decided to paint the school and carry out other beatification work in a bid to spend time and set an example for others.

The migrant workers said they wanted to do something for the village as a token of thanks for good arrangements for their stay done by the mukhiya and the school headmaster Sanjay Kumar. Sanjay said the workers changed the look of the school during their quarantine period. 

West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar has also lauded the work done by the migrant workers at the school.
