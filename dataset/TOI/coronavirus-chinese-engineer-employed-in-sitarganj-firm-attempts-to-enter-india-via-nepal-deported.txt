DEHRADUN: An overcautious Uttarakhand health department deported a Chinese national, reportedly an engineer in a firm in Sitarganj in Udham Singh Nagar district, at the Banbasa India-Nepal border late on Tuesday.

The man, who had visited China last month, had gone to Nepal for a short trip and was trying to enter India via the border town of Banbasa when he was deported to Nepal even though he was not showing any symptoms of the novel coronavirus. 

Talking to TOI, Champawat chief medical officer (CMO) Dr RC Khanduri confirmed that the health department’s team deployed at Banbasa check post had deported a Chinese national. “The man had visited China on January 6 and from there, he went to Nepal in the first week of February. He stayed in Nepal for around three days that then tried to enter India on January 11. Even though all his documents, including work visa, were in place, we followed government guidelines and deported him to Nepal.”

He added that a team of doctors present at the Banbasa check post conducted his scanning and he showed no apparent symptoms of coronavirus. “We told him that if he has to enter India, he should come via New Delhi as entry from check posts are not allowed now. We have also asked doctors who had scanned the Chinese national to keep him under observation for the next 14 days, which is the quarantine period of the virus,” the CMO said, adding that information about the Chinese national has been shared with the US Nagar health department to enable them to track his records.

Meanwhile, the authorities of AIIMS Rishikesh on Wednesday confirmed that all eight cases of suspected coronavirus that were brought to the hospital in the past two weeks have tested negative.
