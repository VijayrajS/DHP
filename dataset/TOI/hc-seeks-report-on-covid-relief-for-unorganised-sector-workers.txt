HC seeks report on Covid-19 relief for unorganised sector workers
2020-05-28
MADURAI: Madras high court on Wednesday sought a status report from the state government on a plea which sought to provide Covid-19 relief to unregistered unorganised sector workers in Ramanathapuram district.

A division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi passed the order while hearing the public interest litigation filed (PIL) by N Malaikannu, founder of an NGO named Association for Rural Development and Upliftment of Humanity to Virtual Integrity.

Malaikannu stated that following the lockdown announcement, all daily wagers and unorganized sector workers are suffering due to poverty. The state government had announced Rs 1,000 and essential commodities for them as Covid-19 relief. The government had also extended such relief to migrant workers in the state. 

He said that the relief provided by the government had not properly reached unregistered unorganised sector workers as most of them, who are uneducated, were not aware of the fact that they should register with the welfare board. 

Malaikannu said that he had sent a representation to the authorities with the list of 1,600 unregistered unorganised sector workers seeking to provide relief to them as it would protect their livelihood.

Since no steps were taken with regard, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench.
