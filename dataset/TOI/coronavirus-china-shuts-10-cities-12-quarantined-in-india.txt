Coronavirus: China ‘shuts 10 cities; 12 quarantined in India
2020-01-25
Twelve people who returned from China and Hong Kong have been quarantined (as a precautionary measure) in hospitals in India — three, including a Briton, in Mumbai, and nine in Kerala’s Ernakulam and Thrissur — as China locked down 10 cities and closed a part of the Great Wall to control the outbreak of a new strain of a coronavirus (nCoV) that has killed 26 people and affected 1,100 people across the globe.

Nepal was the latest to confirm an nCoV case: a student who had returned from China’s Wuhan was treated for respiratory problems and discharged. But the authorities are now searching for the man and his family after samples taken from him and sent to a Hong Kong laboratory tested positive.

Samples from two people in Mumbai and one each from Hyderabad and Bengaluru tested negative, health officials said late on Friday. One woman in Kottayam, Kerala, has been isolated at home and was under observation after she developed a fever.
