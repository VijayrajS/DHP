Rajesh Tope taps committee to reduce rates at private testing laboratories
2020-06-07
PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope has appointed a four-member committee to ascertain charges for Covid-19 tests conducted at authorized private laboratories and the panel is expected to submit its report on June 10.


With cases expected to rise across the state and large dependence on government laboratories for testing, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had called on states to take a call on reducing the cost of testing at private laboratories. Presently, a test for Covid-19 at a private laboratory costs Rs4,500.

“The committee should talk to all stakeholders and come up with an amount that works for private laboratories as well as citizens,” he told TOI. With 80% beds reserved at private hospitals, the minister wants to focus on reducing charges at private labs.

State Health Assurance Society CEO Sudhakar Shinde, who will chair the committee, said, “We will submit a report on the final cost that should be taken then respective collectors can take a call whether they want to call for tenders to further reduce the costs in each district. The report will include the amount set for the state,” he said.

However, representatives of private labs have stated that they are not making any profit and will voice their say on the same. While the tests are free at government labs, the ICMR has fixed charges at private labs at Rs4,500.
