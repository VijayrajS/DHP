HYDERABAD: A passenger who had recently returned from China was kept in isolation at Gandhi Hospital on Monday. A total of 74 cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) so far. 


Another passenger who had returned over 15 days back and had previously tested negative, was admitted to the Gandhi Hospital on Monday after he developed cold and cough and was apprehensive of his condition. His sample was taken for repeating the test, said health authorities. Currently, 70 people continue to be in home isolation after being suspected for the virus. 

“If any of the suspected patients who have been quarantined at home develop symptoms of fever, cough and cold, they are being referred to the Gandhi hospital and tested for the virus.

Meanwhile, health authorities have advised public to adhere to advisories issued by government. “Those who have arrived from affected countries should remain under home isolation for 28 days from date of arrival in India, irrespective of whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic,” says one advisory.
