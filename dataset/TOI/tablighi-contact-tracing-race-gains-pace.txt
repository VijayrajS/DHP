CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation (MC) has traced 123 contacts of five city residents who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi and quarantined them at their homes for 14 days.

“Out of these 123 contacts, 57 are from different areas in Mauli Jagran, 41 from Manimajra, 19 from Bapu Dham and one from Daria. As many as 111 contacts were found as soon as the five returned from Delhi after attending the congregation. Twelve more were traced on Friday,” said a senior official of the MC.

The contacts include family members, relatives and friends. Authorities are still on the job to find out whether there are more contacts. More than 1,400 people have been home quarantined in different parts of the city, according to record. Many are those who had returned to the city from abroad. The UT administration had recently asked the cellular company operators to keep an eye on these people by monitoring their locations.
