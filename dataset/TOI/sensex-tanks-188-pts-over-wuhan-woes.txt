Sensex tanks 188 pts over Wuhan woes
2020-01-29
Mumbai: Spooked by the spread of coronavirus from Wuhan, China and its likely impact on global trade, the sensex lost another 188 points on Tuesday to close below the 41K level for the first time in three weeks. The fears about the likely impact of coronavirus also spooked other Asian markets. Korea’s benchmark index was the most affected while the Chinese market remained closed under government orders.

After opening higher, the sensex lost ground towards the close of session to touch an intraday low of 40,870 points and closed about 100 points off that level at 40,967. The Nifty too closed 63 points lower at 12,056. After the global trend of risk-off trades, meaning not buying high-risk assets like equities and derivatives, in India too foreign funds remained big sellers with a net outflow of Rs 1,358 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 712 crore, BSE data showed.

According to an SBI report that draws parallels with the spread of 2003’s SARS epidemic in South Asian countries, the impact of the new epidemic on trade is yet to be estimated. However, it noted that the novel coronavirus has spread at a much faster pace than SARS, which had affected global trade by about $57 billion at current rates. “The impact of the outbreak on China will be severe as Wuhan is the hub of transport and industry for central China,” Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI, said in the report.

In Tuesday’s trade, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel and RIL were the top losers while strong buying in HDFC and Bajaj Finance cushioned the fall. Of the 30 sensex constituents, 21 closed in the red while nine closed with gains.
