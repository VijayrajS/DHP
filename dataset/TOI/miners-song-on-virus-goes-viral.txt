Hyderabad: A worker of Singareni Collieries has taken upon himself to spread the word on social distancing and precautions to be taken against the novel coronavirus in the coal mines.

Kattoji Naresh (31), an electrician in PVK No. 5 incline mine in Kothagudem, has recorded a video song with action and dance on social distancing. The video has gone viral among the 48,000-strong Singareni miners’ community. 

He also alerts the workers on the precautions they should take in the underground mines. 

“In some of the districts, a few coronavirus cases have been reported and I decided I should let the coal miners know about the dangers of Covid-19 and how to take precautions,” Naresh told TOI. 

The spread of Covid-19 made him think about what more he could do to let the miners know about the pandemic. 

He chose the most popular song of the season composed and sung by Ram Miriyala of Chowraasta band to convey the message of social distancing.

When his daughter Muktika was born a few years ago, he bought a camera and that came in handy now. He followed instructional videos on Youtube and created his song. He even presented himslef as a miner in the video. “Ideally, I would have loved to perform in front of them and convey the message but because of the current situation, I chose to bring out a video,” he said. 

“I have also shown other workers in the video and tried to convey the message,” Naresh said. He has also come out with another video praising the services of doctors, police and municipal workers. 

Naresh, who has done his MBA, joined Singareni Collieries in 2015.
