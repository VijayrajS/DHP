2020-03-18
PUNE: The Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) will soon have a dedicated laboratory for testing of samples for coronavirus collected from across the state. 


The Indian Council of Medical Research on Monday announced that nine additional laboratories, including the one at the AFMC, would soon be made operational for testing of suspected coronavirus patients’ swab samples. “A team of microbiologists, laboratory staffers and technicians recently received training at a facility in New Delhi,” a senior Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) officer told TOI on Tuesday.

The laboratory is coming up at the AFMC’s microbiology department. “This department has several laboratories, out of which one will now function as Covid-19 sample testing centre. The facility is equipped with requisite kits,” the officer said.

“Our team will work in tandem with the health department. We are in the process of formulating a standard operating procedure in consultation with the health department. The number of tests to be performed every day and the roles of our experts will be decided soon,” the officer added. 

“Besides the experts, senior doctors from other departments will provide requisite assistance,” another AFMS officer said. 

“The new facility will enhance our testing capabilities and reduce the time as well,” a senior district administration official said.
