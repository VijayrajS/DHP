PANAJI: With cruise ships being seen as fertile grounds for the Coronavirus (Covid-19), Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) has decided to turn away all international cruise vessels till the end of this month, as a precautionary measure.


International cruise lines have also informed MPT that they are cancelling cruises as passengers across the globe have begun to cancel their bookings. This, said MPT officials and stakeholders, will have a financial impact on stakeholders.

“In view of the coronavirus threat, the central government has decided that no cruise ship from any foreign destination will be allowed to call on Indian ports with immediate effect,” deputy chairman Guruprasad Rai said in a notice to shipping agents.

MPT’s restriction on port calls does not apply to cargo vessels, which continue to arrive as per schedule, but the crew of the vessels have to abide by the standard operating procedures put in place by the Union ministry of health and shipping.

The port has already put in place screening, detection and quarantine system for disembarking seafarers of cargo tankers and other commercial vessels.

Cruise liners MSC Lirica with 1,560 passengers and MV Celebrity Constellation with 2,000 passengers were scheduled to arrive on Sunday and Monday, but were turned away.

MS Nautica, MS Asuka II, Norwegian Jade and Seven Seas Voyager have cancelled their cruises, which were scheduled for April.

“Our revenue from cruise tourism is low so not much impact will be there on our revenue, but yes there will be a dip,” said Rai.

MPT handled 38 cruise vessels till February end and at least 15 more vessels were expected at the port before the season ends.

Apart from international cruise liners, two domestic cruise liners, Angriya and Karnika, also make regular trips to Goa from Mumbai.
