Coronavirus takes toll on festivals & fairs, Shri Nath Mahotsav cancelled in Aurangabad
2020-03-12
AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad district administration has called off the centuries-old tradition of celebrating the Shri Nath Shashthi Mahotsav — on the birth anniversary of Sant Eknath — at Paithan in Aurangabad in view of the Covid-19 scare.



Coronavirus outbreak live updates

This is the first time in its history of about 425 years that the festival will not be held at the Shri Nath temple. 

The district administration cited statistics and guidelines issued by World Health Organisation (WHO) as well as that of ministry of health and family welfare, for calling off the festival. The administration stated the decision was taken to ensure that there is no coronavirus outbreak. 

 Last week, state minister Sandipan Bhumre had announced that the Mahotsav would take place as per the schedule. The locals had then started preparing for the festival. They were taken aback when acting district magistrate Bhandudas Palve on Tuesday issued orders calling off the event.

The Sansthan Shri Eknath Maharaj Vishvasth Mandal, a group of trustees, organise the Shri Nath Shashthi Mahotsav every year. Every year, at least a million people visit the temple situated on the banks of Godavari river. The place also has the Nath Samadhi.

Mangir Baba fair and 

Tableegh Ijtema uncertain

With the ministry of health and family welfare issuing an advisory asking the administration to abstain from granting permission for events where a large number of people may gather, there are doubts whether the Mangir Baba fair and the Tableegh Ijtema will be held this year. While Tableegh Ijtema is set to start on March 28, the annual Mangir Baba fair is scheduled to begin from April 10.
