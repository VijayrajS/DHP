Maharashtra: Covid-19 threat looms over census, NPR exercise
2020-03-22
PUNE: The state government will explore the option of deferring the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) and census updates in Maharashtra during a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee March 26.


Top government officials said the Centre was likely to postpone census and updating of the NPR, scheduled to kick off in all states between April and September. Officials said the postponement could be attributed to the health ministry’s guidelines limiting mass contact on account of coronavirus. The state government was to undertake the exercise between May 1 and June 15 this year.

A minister and a member of the state-government appointed committee told TOI that a final decision on the matter would be taken on March 26. “As the state nears lockdown on account of coronavirus, the execution of the exercise in the predetermined time frame would have to be reviewed,” he said. 

The government had appointed the sub-committee after protests over the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and NPR in the state. 

“The enumerators would be required to go to door-to-door to collect information for the exercise. This would pose a great risk for field functionaries in the wake of coronavirus spread. I think a decision to postpone the two exercises should be taken immediately,” a senior government official said.
