MARGAO: The ordeal of 42 Goan seamen onboard the Diamond Princess cruiseliner quarantined off the coast at Yokohama in Japan, ended on Thursday, as a special Air India flight chartered by the Indian government landed in New Delhi early Thursday morning. It carried all 119 Indian nationals on the vessel. 

An update by the Union ministry of health said that all the evacuees are currently in 14-day quarantine at a facility set up by the Indian Army in Manesar, Haryana. Once they are cleared by the medical team following the quarantine period, they will be allowed to return to their respective homes.

Of the 138 Indian nationals onboard the ship, 16 who had tested positive for coronavirus are hospitalized in Japan, while three crew members opted to undergo the extended quarantine period. 

Dhanasth Raikar, who is among the 42 Goans in quarantine, told TOI, “On our arrival, we were subjected to some blood tests, and the results are awaited.”
