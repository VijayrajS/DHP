Teachers seek rationalisation of state board syllabus to cope with lockdown
2020-04-26
Madurai: With uncertainty prevailing over reopening of schools due to Covid-19, managements are anxious about planning for the next academic year especially if time is lost due to extended closure. Many schools are calling for at least rationalisation of state board syllabus like how CBSE has done to ensure that there is no additional burden on students and teachers.“Schools may become fully functional only by July or August. For high and higher secondary classes, any loss of time will be an additional burden on the students and teachers to complete and review portions in time, particularly those appearing for board exams,” said a mathematics teacher. Teachers feel that rationalising the syllabus can help them plan ahead and ease pressure on them and the students.The Federation of Associations of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu has written to the state education minister K A Sengottaiyan seeking rationalisation of syllabus. “Our schools are struggling to plan the upcoming academic year with the current load of syllabus. To make up for any lost time, we request the minister to rationalize the syllabus proportionate to the time left for the current academic year,” said the association in its letter. However, rationalising syllabus could mean students missing out on certain topics which might otherwise be helpful, especially for those writing competitive exams.On the other hand, online classes seem to be the way forward for schools. At present, only CBSE schools are conducting online classes. “We are planning to try and reopen schools by June, even if not physically. We are planning to start online classes by then,” said the principal of a private school in the city.
