Ajmer: Dantra is the first village in Ajmer district where CCTV cameras are being used to monitor the lockdown. Dantra is a village in Pisanghan block of the district. Eight CCTVs cameras were installed last year to keep a watch over the village with 6,000 residents.

As Dantra village is situated on national highway, there were regular incidents of thefts or robberies. But last year, the former sarpanch installed CCTV cameras on every road leading to village as well as in the centre of the village.

“Around 85 people are home quarantined in the village and they are being monitored through CCTV cameras,” said the gram panch.

Sarpanch Ranjeet said that people from the panchayat have been deputed for eight hours to monitor CCTV cameras. They make daily reports of monitoring, “If we find anyone roaming without reason, people from the control room go and counsel him/her and send them home,” said gram panch.

People from outside the village or in the village are not allowed to move around and the entry points are sealed. “Even grocery vans coming to the village are checked and whereabouts of drivers are noted in a register,” added villagers.

Since this is the time for harvest, those who want to go to their fields need to seek permission from the control room.
