Bareilly: A 55-year-old man’s urge to have fish proved too costly for him, as he ventured out for fishing, defying lockdown orders, and ended up getting attacked by a crocodile.

The incident took place near Ull river in Mahevaganj area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Wednesday night. The man succumbed to his injuries in a hospital on Thursday.

Giving details, a resident who didn’t want to be named said, “Victim Shree Kishan was fond of eating fish. Since the meat market was closed due to lockdown, he and six of his friends went fishing on Wednesday evening.”

“When Kishan was catching fish, a crocodile came out of the river and attempted to pull him in deep water. He shouted for help after which his friends charged at the crocodile with batons and stones, forcing the reptile to leave his prey,” the resident said.

Kishan was immediately rushed to the hospital, but his wounds were deep and excessive blood was lost.

“The victim died during treatment at the district hospital and his body was handed over to the family after autopsy on Thursday,” SHO Kotwali police station Ajay Mishra said.

Meanwhile, divisional forest officer Sameer Kumar told TOI, “We came to know that a man injured by a crocodile died during treatment at the district hospital. He was fishing in Ull river which has a healthy population of crocodile.”

When asked if the family is eligible for compensation, the officer said, “The family has not contacted us for claiming any compensation.”
