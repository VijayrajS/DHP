2020-04-09
BELAGAVI: A 32-year-old mother who is a staff nurse at the Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS) had a surprise caller on Wednesday: chief minister BS Yediyurappa. The CM was calling Suganda Korepura to express his admiration for her dedication and spirit of selfless service. 


As the country battles to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection, nurses and doctors have been at the very front line of this battle, and the hardest part for many has been the prolonged separation from their loved ones, since most healthcare personnel are being housed at lodges in addition to being kept in quarantine for a fortnight. For Suganda, this estrangement from her family was particularly painful, since it meant having to leave her three-year-old daughter behind. Undaunted, Suganda decided to join the battle instead, much to her daughter’s grief. This sacrifice on her part earned her appreciation from the CM. 

“You have been doing a good job despite not being able to see your child. Please cooperate in the future as well. I would like you to take care of your concerns as well,” Yediyurappa told Suganda. 

An elated Suganda said, “I would not even have dreamed of the CM calling me. It left me speechless. His appreciation has filled me with a newfound satisfaction with my work. I am very grateful to him.” 

Suganda, who has been staying at a hotel since March 1, attended to a few infected patients from April 3 through April 5. Donning protective suits, she assisted doctors as they attended to the first positive cases in Belagavi district. She will now have to spend the next fortnight in quarantine. 

“My daughter was very unhappy that I was going away from her, but we have to put everything else aside. It is not just me, many others working at our hospital too have made similar sacrifices. For all of us, duty comes first,” said Suganda.
