GHAZIABAD: The swab samples of six people who had come in the chain of contact with a Covid-19 patient from Raj Nagar Extension have been taken by the health department. 


The six persons include three doctors - two from MMG district Hospital and one from District Combined Hospital. They had come in contact with two paramedics (the advanced life support ambulance driver and the emergency medical technician) who had transported the Covid-19 patient to Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.

Swab samples of three more health staff - a pharmacist, a lab technician and a ward boy - were taken and sent to the National Centre for Disease Control for testing. They were also in the chain of contact of the paramedic staff. 

Sources said that while the sample of one doctor was collected on Sunday, those of the other two were collected on Saturday night. A sample of the District Combined Hospital doctor, who had put himself in self-isolation for a day, has also been collected for swine flu testing.

A sample of a woman from Indirapuram, with travel history to Singapore, has also been sent for testing although she has no symptoms, said district malaria officer GK Mishra. Meanwhile, the two paramedics have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Chief medical officer N K Gupta said that three other people who had travelled to Singapore, Dubai and Slovakia also tested negative.
