BATHINDA: With the the Covid-19 lockdown being strictly implemented, famous shrines of various religions are almost deserted. Devotees even stayed away from temples, which were closed anyway, during the Navratras.


Hundreds of devotees visit Takhat Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo every day. With Baisakhi drawing close, this number increases manifold. But now, there is only a smattering of devotees here. A functionary of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which looks after the Takht, said, “Due to curfew, very few people are turning up. Usually, people from far and wide visit the shrine in these days.”

The famous Shiva Temple at Ranike village on Barnala-Dhuri road is usually thronged by hundreds of devotees every day but only a few people from nearby places visit the shrine these days. 

The Dargah of Hazrat Sheikh, also called Baba Haidar Sheikh in Malerkotla draws huge crowds on Thursday nights. People from far off places, including Haryana and Rajasthan pay obeisance here on Thursdays. Barring a few residents of Malerkotla, there is hardly anyone to be seen here these days. The Sufi saint to whom the shrine is dedicated is known as the founder of Malerkotla. Malerkotla resident Mohammad Iqbal said every Thursday, thousands of people of various religions visit the shrine but now it is almost empty. 

Tilla Baba Farid in Faridkot is another busy shrine lying deserted in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown. Gurdwara Tutti Gandi Sahib in Muktsar, where hordes of people reach for Maghi is also deserted due to curfew, an SGPC employee said.
