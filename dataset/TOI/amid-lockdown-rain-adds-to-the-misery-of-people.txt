COIMBATORE/SALEM: Heavy rain lashed Kurinchi Nagar at Madvarayapuram in Coimbatore district early on Tuesday. The summer showers came as a surprise for residents who woke up to inundated streets.


On Tuesday around 2 am, parts of Madvarayapuram, Alandurai and Sundarapuram received a steady spell of rain. Residents said there were instances of frequent water-logging in several residential areas of Kurinchi Nagar because a drainage canal had not been desilted.

Local residents requested the civic body authorities to desilt the stream immediately in order to prevent water-logging in the future.

By Tuesday afternoon, a team led by a village administrative officer cleared the drainage canal, an official said.

P T Dharmalingam, a resident of Kurinchi Nagar, said officials responded immediately and cleared the stream. “We demanded the public works department to desilt the stream in advance,” he said.

Meanwhile, rain battered across Salem district on Tuesday evening, uprooting trees and knocking off barricades placed on roads as part of the lockdown. The disinfectant tunnel erected at the Salem new bus stand was also thrown off due to strong wind. An average of 11mm rain was recorded across the city, an official said.

Similarly, Dharmapuri district also received good rainfall. At Dharmapuri town, rainwater entered several houses. More than 10 trees were uprooted near Harur. 

A senior official from the meteorological department said the district had received a total of 77mm of rain. “While Harur has recorded 41mm of rain, Dharmapuri town received 13mm, Palacode 15mm and Pappireddipatty 8mm.”
