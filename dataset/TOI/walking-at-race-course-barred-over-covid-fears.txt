Walking at Race Course barred over Covid fears
2020-06-10
Coimbatore: To prevent the spread of Covid-19, district collector K Rajamani has ordered the public not to use the walking track on Race Course till the lockdown is over.

Hundreds of people have been using the stretch for morning walks every day at Race Course ever since the government relaxed the lockdown from May 4. There were lots of complaints of overcrowding and lack of social distancing on the stretch. 

“We came to know that some people failed to wear protective masks and maintain social distancing when they came to the Race Course for a walk. Hence, the district administration has imposed a ban on using the walking track at Race Course until further orders,” the collector said. 

He said the police patrol vehicles have been asked to advise the general public to desist from using the walking track. 

He said that the government has invoked section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that empowers an executive magistrate to issue an order prohibiting assembly of five or more people at one place or from organizing any event/ programme where a gathering can be expected.

Rajamani said that people who had returned from Chennai should compulsorily inform the district administration so that they can be kept under quarantine for at least two weeks. 

“Those who fail to inform the district administration and those who are roaming freely with flu symptoms will be booked under the Epidemic Act,” Rajamani said.
