CHENNAI: A commando of the state police, and assistant commissioner of police posted in north Chennai a fire and rescue services worker tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. All three were later admitted to the Omandurar Government Medical College and Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. 

The commando who tested positive for the infection is attached to the training centre-cum-school at the Marutham complex in Raja Annamalaipuram. Next door to the commando school, close to the posh Boat Club area, is a building housing the core cell CID which handles the chief minister's security arrangements and escorts his convoy every time he steps out. The commando training school was sanitized thoroughly and closed temporarily. The source of the commando's infection is being analysed.

The ACP, the second man to test positive, is thought to have contracted the infection from a containment zones in Royapuram which he recently visited as part of his duty. After he was admitted to the hospital, police advised all his family members to stay under home quarantine. His office was sanitized before being shut.

When news of the fire services man testing positive came and it was known that he had been attached to the Raj Bhavan, there was consternation. Immediately, a press release issued by the additional director of the Raj Bhavan fire station clarified that the said worker had once served there but had been transferred to the T Nagar fire and rescue services station on April 14.

So far, about 100 police personnel have tested positive for the Covid-19 in the city. Of these, 54 police personnel have been shifted from the Omandurar government medical college and hospital to the temporary quarantine centre set up on the IIT-Madras campus. Two doctors who have been infected have also been shifted to the temporary centre, police said.
