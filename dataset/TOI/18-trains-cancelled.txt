JAIPUR: Amid the low turnout in various trains to important destinations, the North Western Railways (NWR) on Thursday decided to terminate the services of nine pairs of trains.

Trains are already facing poor turnout due to the Covid-19 scare for the past one week. “Due to poor passenger load in the trains and to ensure safety of the public, we have decided to terminate the services of nine pairs of trains upto March 31,” said a senior officer of NWR on Thursday. 

At Jaipur railway station, a majority of the trains including Pooja Express, Mandore Express, Aashram Express, Jaipur-Delhi double decker, Jaisalmer-Delhi via Jaipur, Aala Hazrat Express and others witnessed a very poor turnout. “We are reviewing the situation every day and depending on the passenger load, decision has been taken to terminate trains upto March 31,” said a senior officer of the commercial wing of NWR. 

Passengers were confused and clueless on their cancellations, especially those who had pre-booked their tickets online. “In this emergency situation, railways should give us full refund,” said Arjun Ahlawat, who came for cancelation of his tickets to Mumbai which was planned for March 22.
