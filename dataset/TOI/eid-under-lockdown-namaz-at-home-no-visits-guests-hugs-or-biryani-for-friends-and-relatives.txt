Eid under lockdown: Namaz at home, no visits, guests, hugs or biryani for friends and relatives
2020-05-25
PANAJI: For Imtiaz Shaikh, observing Eid-ul-Fitr every year after a month of fasting and abstinence was nothing short of a celebration. He would attend the Eidgah held at Panaji early in the morning, then go home to feast on shir korma followed by a busy evening of attending to guests, distributing biryani in the neighbourhood and wishing loved ones ‘Eid Mubaraq’.

This year owing to the lockdown and social distancing norms, Eid-ul-Fitr prayer will be performed at home to ensure safety followed by a quiet meal with the family.

“I will not be visiting my friends and relatives due to the lockdown. Neither we have invited people to our home this year, nor we will be distributing biryani and shir korma owing to social distancing norms,” Shaikh said. Mosques across the state will remain closed and Eidgah congregations will not be held as a precautionary measure. This year celebrators are therefore going to perform the prayer within the confines of their home and have a low-key observation of the festival.

Saligao-based Tawquir Shaikh starts prepping for the Eid special cuisine days in advance, purchase new clothes for the big day, however this year the annual fervor is amiss.“It doesn’t even feel like Eid,” he said, who for the first time in decades will be restricting himself indoors on Eid-ul-Fitr. “But I’m thankful to be spending the festival with my family unlike the stranded migrant workers who are perhaps spending their Eid traveling to their hometown,” he said.

The All Goa Muslim jamats had earlier issued an advisory to the community to offer the ‘nafl chast namaz’ from their homes along with their family, this year .

“This is a good time to help one’s neighbours and the underprivileged that are affected due to the lockdown,” Bashir Ahmed, president of the jamat said.
