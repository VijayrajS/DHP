KOLKATA: The West Bengal government has decided to postpone the ongoing higher secondary (Class XII) examinations and called off the Class XI exam, which are conducted by the schools based on question papers provided by the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council. All the exams will be rescheduled after April 15.


After the announcement by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, the same was explained by education minister Partha Chatterjee. He also lashed out at some private schools, alleging parents had complained that they were kept flouting the advisories.

Three more days of exams remain now. These will be rescheduled. “The decision was taken in the wake of the ongoing crisis and the immediate need to prohibit movement. The pandemic may flare up with the number of affected persons multiplying in no time,” Chatterjee said.

Among the examinations, which are left includes physics, nutrition, education, accountancy, chemistry, economics, journalism & mass communication, Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, French, statistics, geography, costing and taxation, home management and family resource management.

Earlier, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and the CBSE had decided to reschedule all Class X and Class XII Board examinations till March 31.

Delay in completing the examinations by a month will, however, have a ripple effect on the academic sessions as well the publication of results, alerted the educationists.

Angshuman Guha, an HS science student said, “There are a series of national entrance tests lined up from April. These are yet to be postponed. If those are not rescheduled, I may have to skip them.”

The Class XI examinations conducted by the schools will be held later.
