NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday slammed the BJP government for not taking the threat of coronavirus seriously enough, and hit out at PM Modi saying he should quit wasting India’s time “playing the clown” with his social media accounts when India is facing a health emergency. 


“Dear @PMOIndia, Quit wasting India’s time playing the clown with your social media accounts, when India is facing an emergency. Focus the attention of every Indian on taking on the coronavirus challenge,” Gandhi tweeted.

Gandhi elucidated on “Here’s how it’s done”, sharing a video of Singaporean PM Lee Hsien Loong addressing Singaporeans on how to deal with coronavirus. “There are moments in the life of every nation when its leaders are tested. A true leader would be completely focused on averting the massive crisis about to be unleashed by the virus on India and its economy,” Rahul had earlier tweeted. He also tagged his February 12 tweet in which he said coronavirus is a serious threat to “our people and our economy”.
