Coronavirus outbreak: Delhi budget to be placed, passed in one-day session
2020-03-22
NEW DELHI: In a first, Delhi assembly has curtailed its budget session to just one day following the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country. The budget will be presented and passed the same day.


This is also the first time that the budget session will not begin with the speech of the lieutenant governor. According to the list of business prepared by the Delhi assembly secretariat, the one-day budget session will begin with tabling of the copy of economic survey of 2019-20 by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the charge of finance department.

It will be followed by the status report of the outcome budget 2019-20 (up to December 2019). The document provides insight into the output and outcome of the allocations made under the state budget for various projects. Following this, Sisodia will present his sixth consecutive annual budget for FY 2020-21. He will later table the supplementary demands for grants for the FY 2019-20 and appropriation bills.

To ensure there was lesser number of people in the assembly, the government has decided not to allow the guests and visitors to the House. Delhi assembly secretariat has also allowed its staff, which was not required for the session, to work from home.

Former secretary general of Lok Sabha, PDT Achary, said that extraordinary situations call for extraordinary measures. “The tabling of economic survey, presentation of budget and discussion on it could have been spaced out if there was time. But due to the novel coronavirus scare, Delhi government seems to have taken this decision,” Achary said.
