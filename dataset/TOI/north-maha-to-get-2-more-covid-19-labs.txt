2020-05-23
Nashik: The Nashik divisional commissionerate is starting two more coronavirus testing laboratories — one each in Ahmednagar and Jalgaon — taking the total number of Covid-19 testing labs in the region to four.

While the testing lab at Jalgaon will be located at the government medical college and hospital (GMCH), the one at Ahmednagar will be located at the premises of the district civil hospital.

At present, the two existing Covid-19 labs are located at the government medical college at Dhule and at Dr. Vasantrao Pawar Medical College and Hospital at Nashik.

“The acquisition of two new testing labs would ease the pressure on the existing ones as the number of suspected Covid-19 cases in the region are increasing,” said state health officials.
