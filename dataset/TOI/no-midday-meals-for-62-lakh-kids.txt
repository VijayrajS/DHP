JAIPUR: The spread of coronavirus has cast its spell on the nutrition of 62.22 lakh school children in the state. The closure of schools till March 30 has also led to the suspension of the midday meal programme in 66,876 schools leaving the children without a nutritional diet.

Unlike Kerala, the state has not roped in its teachers to distribute the meal citing the distance of students’ homes from the school. The Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed concern over the closure of the programme due to coronavirus scare and sought responses from the Centre, state and Union territories. 

Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said, “Schools have been shut affecting the programme. At present, teachers are not distributing the meal at the homes of students. The state is exploring the feasibility of developing a distribution mechanism.” The scheme is prepared for students enrolled in classes I to VIII in government schools. The schools have been shut from March 12. 

The scheme serves two purposes —it tackles the problem of nutrition and increases enrolments in schools. Several reports have proved that the scheme has proved to be the lifeline of these children who come from low-income families. “It appears that schools are least likely to open by March 30. In such a situation, I believe that state should utilise its biggest human resource—the teachers in distributing the meals at the doorsteps,” said KB Kothari, senior educationist.
