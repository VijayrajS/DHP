2020-06-03
Chandigarh: Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday directed the Haryana government to take a decision on the representation against setting up of dharamshalas and similar establishments in thickly populated parts of Panchkula as quarantine centres. The state has been told to decide on the issue within a week.

These places are being used by the Panchkula administration to quarantine people who have returned from abroad to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

“The respondents are directed to ensure that the protocol and safety measures required to be adopted at quarantine centres and restrictions imposed upon inmates lodged in the centres are strictly complied with and followed by the authorities. Counsel for Haryana fairly submitted that the representation dated May 26 filed by the petitioner shall be considered and decided by the authorities within a period of one week,” observed the HC while disposing of the matter.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli passed these orders while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Devender Mahajan, a resident of Mansa Devi Complex area of Panchkula.
