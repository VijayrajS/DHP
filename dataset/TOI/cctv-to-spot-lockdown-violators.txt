AHMEDABAD: Devendra Vanzara, 21, a resident of Krishnanagar, was booked on Saturday by cops for venturing out during the lockdown. 


According to a senior police official, he started abusing the police and also had a scuffle with the police officer on duty at Baliyakaka Chowk in Krishnangar. 

“We called extra enforcement from the police station and booked him under Section 186 of the IPC,” said a police official. 

Police have now started booking those violating the lockdown on the basis of CCTV camera footage from nearby areas. 

“We will now be strict and nobody violating the lockdown rules will be spared,” said police commissioner Ashish Bhatia.
