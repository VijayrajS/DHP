SURAT: As many as 50% of the total Covid-19 cases in the last few days are linked to three Civic zones in the city. According to the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials, 68 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Sunday. 

"We have observed that 50% of the cases in the city are linked to three civic zones in the city _ Katargam, Limbayat and central zone. On Sunday, out of the total 68 fresh cases, Katargam recorded 25 cases. In Katargam, cases are coming from diamond workers, workers' family members. It is physically difficult to visit every diamond unit to enforce social distancing and other Covid-19 rules but unit owners are requested to follow these rules for the sake of public health,'' Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, Surat. 

Three more people succumbed to the virus on Sunday taking the death toll to 194 in the city. "All the three people who died of Covid-19 on Sunday had comorbidity and were aged. We have come across such cases where people are not reporting to doctors when they develop initial symptoms fearing the SMC would hospitalise them but people don't need to worry about it. If you have just a cough, cold or fever, you will not be forced to be admitted to hospital. If you have breathing problems then only you will be hospitalized for your better treatment,'' Pani said. 

"People have a misconception that if they will tell about cough and fever, SMC would consider them as Covid-19 patients. We want to make it clear that we don't want them as Covid-19,'' he added. 

'At present, 130 patients are on oxygen, seven patients on ventilator and 44 patients are on bipape. This indicates that people are not reporting to doctors when they develop symptoms and late admission make their conditions critical,'' Pani added. 

Meanwhile, 59 Covid-19 patients were discharged on Sunday taking the total number of discharged patients to 1775 in the city.
