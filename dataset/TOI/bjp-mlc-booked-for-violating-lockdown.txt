Aurangabad: A BJP MLC from Beed district, Suresh Dhas, was booked on Monday for violating the lockdown and visiting a containment zone where he interacted with several people.

In the past week, 12 Covid-19 cases have been reported across Beed of which seven have been reported from Sangvi Patan village in Ashti tehsil.

The MLC visited this village following which his pictures went viral on social media platforms. Taking cognizance of the same, Beed police registered an offence against him at Ashti police station under sections 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by authorities), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. In addition this, sections of National Disaster Management Act and Maharashtra Police Act have also been imposed.

Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar said, “We have registered an offence against Dhas for violating the lockdown and entering containment zone.”

The officer said that this is the second offence registered against the MLC during the ongoing lockdown. “Earlier, he was booked for defying border sealing and going to Ahmednagar district,” he added.

The registration of offence was followed by the local crime branch (LCB) summoning the MLC and getting the mandatory bond signed by him under CrPC section 107 (security for keeping the peace in other cases).

“I had to go there to reassure the people. Moreover, I did not enter the village. There is political conspiracy behind registering offences against me,” Dhas said.
