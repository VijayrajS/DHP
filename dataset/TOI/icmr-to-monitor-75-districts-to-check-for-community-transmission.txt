Coronavirus: ICMR to monitor 75 districts to check for community transmission
2020-05-09
NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) plans to start a study in about 75 districts of the country that have the maximum number of Covid-19 cases to check whether community transmission has begun.

The health ministry has also asked states to test at least 250 samples of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza like illnesses (ILI) from each district as part of active surveillance to monitor spread of the infectious disease.

Officials said the ICMR study was initially planned to be conducted through rapid antibody test kits. However, it was postponed when these kits showed variations in results. Now, the council is planning to use ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test kits to carry out the study.

The ELISA test kit is similar to the rapid antibody test kit as it detects antibodies in the blood. But these kits are yet to be validated by ICMR. The ICMR had conducted similar studies in March to check community transmission. But it had maintained that there was not adequate evidence to show community spread.
