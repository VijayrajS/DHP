Covid-19 hits GIDC’s SEZ land auction, coal block plans
2020-04-03
Panaji: The nationwide lockdown to curtail the spread of Covid-19 has brought the process to appoint a consultant for the Dongri-Tal II coal block and auction of around 5 lakh sqm of industrial land to a grinding halt, officials said.

With the state’s energies focused on combating the spread of the virus, authorities hope that the Centre gives Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) additional time to complete the coal block utilisation process.

“Everything has come to a standstill because the focus is on fighting coronavirus,” GIDC chairman Glen Ticlo said. “Now we have to rework everything and ask the Centre for more time.”

GIDC needs to appoint a consulting agency that will provide transaction advisory services for selection of a mine developer cum operator (MDO) and an agency for marketing the coal. Another consultant is being sought by GIDC to assist in the auction of 5 lakh sqm of industrial land recovered from the Special Economic Zone promoters.“Two committees were formed to take these processes forward but after that nothing could take place,” a senior government official said. 

The department of industries has constituted a selection committee and a monitoring committee for each of the projects. 

Industry secretary Nila Mohanan heads the selection committee, while industry minister Vishwajit Rane heads the monitoring committee. 

However, Mohanan also serves as the health secretary and Rane is the state’s health minister.

The industries department had issued an order to GIDC in the last week of December asking GIDC to go ahead with the auction of a fraction of the 38 lakh sqm of SEZ land and submit an action taken report.

The state government has been offered the Dongeri Tal-II Coal Block in Madhya Pradesh for utilisation. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had told GIDC that Goa cannot afford to lose out on the coal block.
