2020-04-16
AHMEDABAD: City police on Tuesday morning booked a man from Chandlodia at Tapovan Circle on Sardar Patel Ring Road near Chandkheda, when he was returning to his home on foot presuming that the 21-day lockdown was over. 


The man, Vijay Rathod, 40, a resident of Alfa Row House in Chandlodia, had been in Bayad taluka of Aravalli district on March 23 when the lockdown was announced. Rathod stayed there for 21 days waiting to return to his home in Ahmedabad. 

On Monday night, Rathod thought that the lockdown was about to be over on Tuesday, so he left Bayad and began walking towards the city. He walked for some distance and later took a lift in a truck carrying vegetables and then resumed his journey on foot from Mehsana. 

Rathod was around 12km from his home when Chandkheda police apprehended him and booked him for violating the lockdown notification. 

A cop said that Rathod had travelled around 80km from Bayad to Ahmedabad to reach his home, but his journey was cut short at Tapovan Circle. Rathod had crossed the borders of Mehsana and Gandhinagar districts evading the eyes of cops. But as he presumed that the 21-day lockdown had ended on April 15, and was unaware of the new extension for 19 days, he started walking on road without making any effort to hide and got caught.
