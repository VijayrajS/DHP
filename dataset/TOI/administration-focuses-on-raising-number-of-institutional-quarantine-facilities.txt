2020-05-26
Pune: The district administration is gearing up to identify more facilities for institutional quarantine in the wake of the spike in Covid-19 cases and also to accommodate people flying in from international destinations. 

The health ministry has mandated 14-day quarantine — seven days of institutional quarantine followed by a week of home isolation — for people reaching in international flights. The administration has so far readied 314 quarantine facilities. Most of them are for the rural areas, followed by areas under the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits.

Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram the need for institutional quarantine facilities would increase once the number of people reaching Pune from various countries increased. He said the bigger challenge was to ready quarantine facilities for the slum clusters and rural areas where “home quarantine” was difficult.
