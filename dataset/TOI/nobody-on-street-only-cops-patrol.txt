However, on Saturday, shopkeepers in the entire state capital downed shutters on their own, although at a few places, traders said they were told by the police and administrative officials to close down. As a result, not a single soul was spotted in markets like Aminabad, Alambagh, Hazratganj and Nishatganj, which usually remain abuzz with activity throughout the day.

Even Charbagh railway station had only a few people on platforms with many cancelling tickets. In most localities, people preferred to stay indoors. Jatin Agarwal, a sports goods shop owner, said, “I came here to open my shop, but police told me to shut it. I had received an order to supply 20 badminton racquets today, but now I have to tell them to wait till Monday.”
