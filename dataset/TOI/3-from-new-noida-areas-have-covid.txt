Noida: Three more persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Noida on Saturday, taking the total to 95. While two of the cases were reported from Acchar village in Greater Noida, the third was from Sector 15A in Noida.

Officials said the source of infection was unknown for the two patients from Acchar â€” a man and woman, aged 39 and 35, respectively. In Sector 15A, the woman who tested positive is a Delhi resident and had come to visit her son. Her source, too, is yet to be confirmed. 

Since both these areas did not report any previous case, they would be added to the list of hotspots. Officials said the primary and secondary contacts of these three persons were being traced. Of the 95 people who tested positive in Noida so far, 37 have been discharged and the others are undergoing treatment at various hospitals.
