2020-05-01
New Covid-19 cases in India spiked again on Thursday, crossing 1,800 for only the second time and falling just eight short of Tuesday’s peak of 1,840, while the day’s death toll stayed above 70 for the second straight day.


With 583 fresh cases, Maharashtra now has recorded over 10,000 coronavirus infections. The state’s tally stand at 10,498, roughly equal to the next three states put together — Gujarat (4,395), Delhi (3,515) and Rajasthan (2,625).

While Maharashtra and Gujarat (313 new cases) reported nearly the same number of fresh coronavirus infections as Wednesday, numbers surged in Punjab (162), Tamil Nadu (161) and Rajasthan (146). While both Punjab and Tamil Nadu reported their highest daily numbers, the change was most dramatic in Punjab, which had reported just 34 cases on Wednesday. The spike was due to as many as 142 pilgrims, who had returned from Nanded, testing positive.
