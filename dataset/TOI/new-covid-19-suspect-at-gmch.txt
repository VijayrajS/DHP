NAGPUR: A 43-year-old male patient having history of travel to Dubai reported to Government medical college and Hospital (GMCH) for corona screening on Saturday evening. He was suffering from high fever, cough, cold, and body ache.


As the patient was showing serious symptoms, GMCH authorities decided to admit him in the quarantine ward. His swab samples were collected immediately and sent to the lab facility at Indira Gandhi Government Medical college (IGGMCH) for testing. Reports are expected to arrive on Sunday evening or on Monday.

“The patient informed that he went to Dubai on February 18 and returned on February 25. He willingly came for corona screening. We admitted him in Ward No 25 of the isolation ward,” said Dr Avinash Gawande, Medical Superintendent of the Hospital.

The patient was healthy when he came back from Dubai on February 25. He started feeling cough, cold and body ache from March 2. As all these symptoms along with fever continued even on the fifth day, he reached GMCH for corona screening.
