Children find innovative ways to stay busy during lockdown
2020-04-13
MUSSOORIE: Forced to stay indoors due to the Covid-19 lockdown, children are resorting to different learning and leisure time activities to keep themselves busy. While some are trying hands at cooking, some are taking music lessons online, and so on.


“I introduced my kids to online learning courses which are free. My son is learning coding and my daughters are taking singing classes and learning German language,” tells Smriti Hari, a city resident. She added that people are trying to involve their kids in constructive activities so that they learn some new skill during the lockdown.

Some parents are also engaging their kids in yoga to better their mental and physical health. “I conduct yoga classes for my kids every morning and they are learning pranayama and several other asanas,” says Ashok Mahendroo, another local. He adds that yoga compensates for the lack of physical activity during the lockdown.

Several children, especially girls, are taking to arts and crafts to keep themselves busy. “My daughter is recording tutorial videos in which she explains the process of making pop-up cards and candles,” tells Pallavi Gupta, a city resident.

Gardening and cooking are also becoming popular among children. Meanwhile, playing online games and watching cartoons and movies are still the biggest hits among kids. “Kids have been spending two to three hours each day teaming up with their friends on various online platforms. At times, it becomes difficult to control them,” says a parent who did not wish to be named.
