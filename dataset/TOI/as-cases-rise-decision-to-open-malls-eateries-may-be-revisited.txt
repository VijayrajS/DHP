As Covid-19 cases rise in Delhi, decision to open malls, eateries may be revisited
2020-06-11
NEW DELHI: With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing rapidly, Delhi government may review its decision to allow shopping malls, restaurants and religious places to open.

Sources said both the AAP government and LG’s office have been deliberating on various restrictions that may need to be enforced again to check the spread of Covid-19. 

During the all-party meeting on Tuesday, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal sought to know from the representatives of various political parties if they thought malls and restaurants should be shut again.

While the LG office and chief secretary did not comment on the issue, a senior Delhi government functionary said that the elected dispensation will follow the guidelines issued by the Centre. “If the number surges we will take a call accordingly. In Delhi we are dependent on the Centre for a lot of things. But we will review the situation with time,” the official said.

After keeping them closed for almost 75 days due to the nationwide lockdown, Delhi government, from June 8, allowed shopping malls and restaurants to start operating again.

To revive the economy, the Centre has allowed all states and Union territories to lift curbs from most activities but educational institutions, Delhi Metro and cinema halls will continue to remain closed at least till June 30. Delhi government has also kept banquet halls and hotels closed.

Talking to reporters, state health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said imposing complete lockdown will be illogical as the number of cases will still increase.

“When the lockdown was imposed, there were 100 cases across the country, and now that number has gone up to thousands. If we impose lockdown again, there will be no logic as the cases will still increase from 2.5 lakh to 25 lakh,” Jain said. “We have to learn to live with the virus and it is here to stay for two-three years.”
