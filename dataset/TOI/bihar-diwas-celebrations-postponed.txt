Chief secretary Deepak Kumar said the annual event would not be celebrated from March 22 this year. “All mass events, including sports and other cultural programmes, have been postponed. The date for Bihar Diwas celebrations will be announced in the coming weeks,” he said.

Sanjay Kumar Singh, state project officer of Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) said, “It’s not possible to organise the three-day fest in the prevailing scenario. The situation is quite sensitive right now and holding events involving mass gatherings will only increase risk of spread of virus. As of now, we are waiting for situation to normalise. Thereafter, a date will be finalised by the state government for celebrating Bihar Diwas,” he said.

Singh added that all government departments have been asked to call off the bidding process regarding activities and programmes for Bihar Diwas. “Installation of tents had started at Gandhi Maidan, where the main event was to be organised. All firms have been instructed to stop the preparations and dismantle the tents, main stage and barricading at the main venue and other places,” he said.
