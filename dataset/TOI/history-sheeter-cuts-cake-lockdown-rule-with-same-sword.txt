Surat: A history sheeter celebrated his birthday hoodwinking lockdown and social distancing rules on Friday. If that was not all, he also cut his cake with a sword, said Amroli police, who arrested 15 persons on Saturday. 

They accused have been charged of violating lockdown rules in the celebration as well as for the other separate offence of allegedly using a sword to cut the cake.

The incident came to light only after video and photos of the cake-cutting ceremony using the sword went viral on social media. Police were caught unawares about the birthday party of the history sheeter who operates a gang of criminals and has been arrested multiple times in the past for offences like murder and extortion. Police arrested Amit Rajput alias Lalu Jhalim and 14 others for the alleged celebrations and for violating orders issued under public notification and negligent act that can spread disease. In another offence the accused and his associates were arrested for use of sword under Arms Act.

“Police have taken strict actions against the accused soon after it came to police’s knowledge. We are investigating as to how they could gather at one place,” said Prashant Sumbe, in-charge deputy commissioner of police, zone IV.

Soon after the party, a video went viral on social media the same day, but police remained ignorant of it till the time it was highlighted by a section of media. Ironically, city police conducted a vehicle checking drive in Amroli area at two spots and checked each vehicle on both ends of Amroli Bridge. Amid that, Rajput could reach the spot of his birthday party celebration behind Gandhari Ashram on Tapi river bank without any hassle.
