Halfway through the lockdown, shopkeepers say supplies of essential items running out

Nainital: As his stock of pulses, rice and flour runs out, Sundar Singh Negi, a shopkeeper in Garud town of Bagehswar is worried about the supplies that he is yet to receive from Haldwani, more than 150 km away. 

Negi and many others like him — shopkeepers who cater to people in the hills of Uttarakhand, have been waiting for the supplies of essential items from the plain regions of the state since a few days now. 

“Ever since the lockdown came into force, the supply has been erratic. Our stock of flour, rice, pulses and almost all the essential items is about to end. I have the inventory of just two or three more days and there is no clarity when the next supply would arrive,” Negi said, worry evident in his voice.

Shopkeepers say that even when supplies reach these remote areas, the cost of the items have increased manifold leaving them no choice but to increase the price themselves. 

“On an average, pulses are priced at Rs 90/kg. However, our suppliers in Haldwani say that the price has now increased to Rs 110/kg. Even though I am ready to pay that price, the suppliers say that supplies will take time to reach,” Negi said.

The situation in almost all the small towns and villages across the hills is the same. 

Traders and shopkeepers that TOI spoke to in places like Kausani, Kapkot, Binsar and other areas voiced similar concerns. 

“There is a sense of panic which gets accentuated when essential items begin to be in short supply. As a result, many people are keen on hoarding foodstuff,” said Alok Singh, owner of a shop near Kausani. 

He added, “We have told people many times not to hoard the food items and to buy only as much as they need. However, with no clarity as to how long this situation will continue, it is difficult to convince people.”
