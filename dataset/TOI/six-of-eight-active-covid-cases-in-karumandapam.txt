TRICHY: The active Covid-19 positive cases in Trichy city have increased to eight as on Sunday, out of which, seven have either returned from Chennai or were in close contact with the Chennai returnees. 

Meanwhile, Karumandapam locality in the Trichy Corporation alone accounts for six of the eight active cases, but the civic body is unlikely to establish a containment zone there citing the revised protocols.

Ward number 45 alone has six active cases while an active positive case each is reported at Thiruverumbur and Vayalur road. The corporation said that a survey is on to trace the contacts.

“The houses of the active cases were isolated. There is no community spread as the source of infection was identified. There is no need for a containment zone,” a senior corporation official said. 

The civic body is also surveying whether neighbours display any symptoms. Disinfection process through sanitary workers is underway near the houses of the active cases.

Till May 18, the city had only one active Covid-19 positive case. However, in the past week active cases quickly surged to eight. Karumandapam locality in the past two months had recorded four cases as on May 22.

On Sunday, three family members of a Covid-19 patient hailing from Karumandapam tested positive. A 52-year-old man, who visited Chennai to bring back his parents, who were both found positive on May 22, also tested positive. 

The man’s wife and son also tested positive. All three are asymptomatic.
