BENGALURU: The state government on Tuesday said it would strictly implement lockdown measures till April 20. Excise commissioner V Yeshwanth ordered closure of liquor shops till April 20, much to the dismay of many consumers. Vlubs, bars & restaurants and liquor outlets have been closed for almost a month.


The Centre is expected to give relief in areas which are not Covid-19 hotspots after a review. “The situation will be reviewed on April 20 for graded relaxation of containment norms in sync with the Centre’s guidelines,’’ chief minister BS Yediyurappa said. He also appealed to people “to follow the seven steps the Prime Minister gave in his speech”.

The lockdown extension till May 3 was a disappointment for the Karnataka government which was hoping for graded lifting.

Having bucked the national average with 12 of 30 districts not reporting any positive cases, the state hoped that Modi would give the green signal for partial lifting of the lockdown. Deputy chief minister and IT-BT minister CN Ashwath Narayan had scheduled a video conference with industry captains but cancelled it. “We thought it’s better to wait for the PMO’s advisory,” Narayan said.

“Based on the Centre’s guidelines, we’ll formulate a policy for relaxation of norms for the rural economy, industry and sectors that provide labour,’’ Yediyurappa said.

Sources said a decision would be taken on April 20 with regard to opening of liquor shops, plying of autorickshaws and allowing industries, IT-BT and garment units to open.

Home minister Basavaraj Bommai said there would be strict checking and more barricades erected to restrict unnecessary movement of people. The Union government is also planning micromanagement of hotspots to contain the pandemic.
