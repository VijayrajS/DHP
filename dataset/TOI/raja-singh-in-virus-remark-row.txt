2020-04-11
HYDERABAD: BJP MLA T Raja Singh raked up a fresh controversy with his remarks against China on the spread of novel coronavirus. In his reply to a mail by counsellor in Chinese embassy in India, Liu Bing, Raja Singh said the entire world believes that coronavirus had originated from Wuhan in China. “You said that Chinese people are ready to work with Indians to prevail over the pandemic. I would like to send a message to the Chinese government through you that WHO should introduce an antibiotic as soon as possible to save the world from this deadly virus,” he said.


 Bing agreed the pandemic broke out in Wuhan. “But China is the first country to report the coronavirus... It does not mean the virus had originated from Wuhan. It could break out anywhere in the world,” he said in the mail. Koride Mahesh
