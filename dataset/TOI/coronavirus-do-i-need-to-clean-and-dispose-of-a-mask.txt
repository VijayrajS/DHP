Coronavirus: Do I need to clean and dispose of a mask?
2020-04-06
Used masks lying around pose health risks if someone comes in contact with the respiratory secretions in them and then touches their face. So, it is important that the masks are cleaned frequently and disposed of when not needed. 


According to the WHO, masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 


Here are some of the precautions you need to take before you start using your mask:

Cleaning the mask -


 Change or clean the mask once its inner lining becomes moist
 Cloth masks should be washed regularly, either by hand using soap or in a machine with regular detergent, and air dried
 Mask can be reused even if you are sick, but donâ€™t share it with others
 Surgical and other single-use masks cannot withstand washing and should be disposed of. If you want to reuse a mask, ensure that it remains dry. 
 You can store mask in dry ziplock bags, preferably with desiccating gel that can absorb moisture

Disposing of the mask



 To properly dispose of a mask, fold it in half inwards so the inner lining is covered. 
 Fold it in half two more times so it looks like a roll. 
 Then, wrap the ear loops or strings around the roll so that it does not open up. 
 Wrap it in a piece of tissue before throwing in a lined, closed bin

It is recommended that you have two masks so that you can wear one, while the other is washed and dried.

It is critical to emphasize that aside from wearing masks, maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.
