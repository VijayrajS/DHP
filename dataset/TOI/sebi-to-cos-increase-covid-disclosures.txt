Sebi to companies: Increase Covid disclosures
2020-05-21
MUMBAI: To help investors make informed decisions about their holdings of stocks and bonds, markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday asked listed entities to disclose the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their businesses. 


Sebi acknowledged that many listed entities have provided disclosures about shutdown of operations due to Covid-19, and some entities have also intimated exchanges about actions taken for sanitation, safety, etc. But Sebi said that disclosures relating to the financial impact were not enough. 

The disclosures sought include information about shutdown & reopening plans of their operations, expected impact on revenue & profit, debt-servicing capabilities, supply chain, and impact on demand for their products. “To have continuous information about the impact of Covid-19 on operations, listed entities may provide regular updates, as and when there are material developments,” a Sebi circular said. The directions are effective immediately.

Listed entities around the world have been making disclosures regarding the impact of the pandemic and “regulators have encouraged timely reporting as well as complete and accurate disclosure of the impact”, Sebi said. 

“Listed entities (in India) should endeavour to ensure that all investors have access to timely, adequate and updated information. Towards this end, entities are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their business, performance and financials, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to the extent possible and disseminate the same.” 

The regulator also warned companies from making selective disclosures. While submitting financial statements under the Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements Regulation, listed companies may specify the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on their finances, to the extent possible, the circular noted.
