How prompt response helped Vizag stem coronavirus tide
2020-04-22
VISAKHAPATNAM: Visakhapatnam district started receiving nearly two or three Covid-19 positive cases from March 9 to early April. But, now the number of cases seems to have been arrested. 11 of 13 districts in Andhra Pradesh have reported Covid-19 positive cases so far. Of these, Visakhapatnam has reported the lowest number of cases— 21, followed by East Godavari (26), as of April 21.


While all other districts are witnessing a spurt in cases, Visakhapatnam seems to have managed to stem the tide. Doctors attribute this to an all-inclusive, multi-pronged approach, including prompt quarantining of foreign returnees as well as those on domestic trips since March.

 

Further, mapping suspects and home quarantine cases through junior doctors, a robust command control centre, early precautions and spotting of suspects, testing as well as the strict implement of the lockdown, cluster containment in red zones and door-to-door surveillance helped the administration in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus. 

Speaking to TOI, Dr PV Sudhakar, member of the Covid-control committees and AMC principal said, “Visakhapatnam started taking precautionary measures since March when passengers from abroad were arriving in the city. They were being screened at the airport and being quarantined either at home or in hospitals depending on their condition.”

“We assigned every 10 families where there were foreign returnees to one junior doctor who mapped all home quarantine cases, traced contacts, got them tested. Every junior doctor reported to a pulmonologist,” Dr Sudhakar explained.

Those susceptible to the virus and displayed symptoms were promptly brought to isolation wards in hospitals as per requirement. “There is also a rapid response team (RRT) for 98 GVMC wards, comprising 20 groups, each consisting of a doctor, a paramedic and a GVMC employee to locate houses. Upon receiving information about a suspected case, a team would reach the location within 10 minutes,” the AMC principal said. Dr Sudhakar credited district collector V Vinay Chand for devising multi-pronged strategy to ensure early contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, hospitalisation of suspects on one hand and preventing the spread of the virus by enforcing an effective lockdown on the other.

Dr Devi Madhavi, in charge of quarantine facilities said, “Cluster containment of red zones is being done effectively. The 74 quarantine facilities where those with any travel history, including migrant workers, are being observed.”

“GVMC and village ward volunteers are carrying out house-to-house fever surveys and the public is largely adhering to the lockdown,” said Dr Madhavi.
