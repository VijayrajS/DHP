SUAT: The SMC has roped in 808 school teachers of Nagar Prathmik Sikshan Samiti to keep a tab on those placed under home quarantine in various areas of the city.

"These teachers have been saddled with the responsibility to monitor home quarantined people in the city," said an SMC official. 

SMC school board chairman Hashmukh Patel said: "It is necessary to ensure that home quarantined people don't venture out from their homes and follow the lockdown strictly. The teachers have been roped in to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 in the city.'

"The teachers will also guide home quarantined people about dos and don'ts and assist the SMC's health team in its fight against the pandemic,'' Patel added.
