2020-04-05
BENGALURU: Karnataka witnessed its highest single-day jump in coronavirus cases on Saturday as 16 more people, including a radio jockey in Bengaluru, tested positive. The state’s tally now stands at 144, climbing from 128 on Friday.


In the latest cases, seven people from Mysuru district tested positive, five from Bengaluru, two from Dakshina Kannada, and one each from Ballari and Udupi.

In Bengaluru, the case of the 43-year-old radio jockey has baffled the health department. “His wife had travelled to the US, but she tested negative. The man’s report is positive,” an official said. “The patient’s mother had tested positive on March 31; her condition is critical and she is on ventilator support at a private hospital.” The staff of the radio station where the RJ is employed have been declared as primary contacts. The health surveillance unit of Bengaluru Urban district has asked them to self-isolate.

Two other cases in Bengaluru are the contacts of a Covid-19 patient, a 25-year-old woman who had returned from London on March 18. On Saturday, her father and house helper were confirmed to be infected. A 78-year-oldman, who returned from Dubai on March 17, and a 60-year-old man, who arrived from Germany recently, are among the new cases in the tech capital, which has recorded 55 cases so far.

The two positive cases in Dakshina Kannada have been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat meet in Delhi. The two men are aged 43 and 52. Overall, 15 participants and one contact have tested positive in Karnataka. Minister S Suresh Kumar said 380 samples of people linked to the gathering had been tested and 214 reports had been received. Of these, 198, including samples of 19 foreigners, are negative.
