They all returned to their native places on March 20 and are young,” said Sanjay. Elaborating on the two positive cases reported in Gaya on Thursday, Sanjay said: “The two Gaya women are relatives of the staffer of a private hospital in Munger, where a man who tested positive for Covid-19 after his death on March 21, had visited for treatment before his death. The 24-year-old private hospital staffer contacted the virus from the Munger deceased and his report came on March 31.” He added, “The hospital staff’s wife (21) and his mother (41) have tested positive for Covid-19," said Sanjay.

Gaya civil Surgeon Dr BK Singh confirmed the latest cases. The area where the women live is already sealed following the receipt of their family member’s positive test report.
