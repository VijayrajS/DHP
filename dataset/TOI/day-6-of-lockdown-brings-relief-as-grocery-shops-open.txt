Day 6 of lockdown brings relief as grocery shops open in Goa
2020-03-31
PANAJI/MARGAO: Sixth day of the lockdown witnessed some marked improvement in the availability of supplies across the state. Horticulture stores and grocery shops were open in most parts while arrangements were made by municipalities and panchayats with the assistance from their respective MLAs to supply groceries and vegetables to all wards, if not to all homes.


Vegetable trucks were seen moving about, stopping at popular junctions to sell vegetables. However, the demand far exceeded the supply in most towns. 

The exercise of supplying essentials through politicians, however, invited criticism from several quarters terming it as an attempt to derive political mileage.

In many towns, youth groups came forward to make arrangements to supply essentials. In Bandora, some youth made arrangements to supply milk and vegetables to people. “Stock was limited, but if government help is received, we can make proper planning so that nobody comes out of their homes,” one youth volunteer said.

Several organisations also contributed in relief arrangements. While Karmali Samiti was engaged in stitching face masks for distribution as masks remain in short supply, the Humanitarian Relief Society of Goa started distributing free groceries to the poor and needy families across Goa.

In Panaji, doorstep delivery of groceries by the Corporation of the City of Panaji commenced on Monday. CCP tweaked its practice and has now asked residents to get in touch with their local councillor for groceries.

Fresh fish has also begun to show up in Panaji though fishermen have chosen to sell at certain locations instead of heading to the fish market.

Despite bars remaining shut, complaints of liquor being made available on order and delivered at chosen places at Curchorem were received by South Goa police over the last few days, sources said.
