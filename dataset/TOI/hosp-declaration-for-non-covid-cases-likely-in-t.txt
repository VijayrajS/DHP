Hospital declaration for non-Covid cases likely in Telangana
2020-04-15
HYDERABAD: The declaration form process initiated by several hospitals across the country for non-Covid patients may be adopted in Telangana also.

“This is being debated among all doctors and the hospitals may soon insist on the form,” a city doctor said.

The declaration form says that when non-Covid patients come for urgent treatments for cancer, kidney and other serious ailments, they must sign on this declaration form, not holding the doctors responsible. 

The form states that patients will have to take care of themselves to protect them from Covid-19 patients. While doctors will take safety protection measures, the form makes it clear that patients should be aware that they could contract coronavirus from staff or medical personnel. TNN
