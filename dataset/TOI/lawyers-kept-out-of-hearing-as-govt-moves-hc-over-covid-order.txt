Lawyers kept out of hearing as govt moves HC over Covid order
2020-05-26
Ahmedabad: Two days after the Gujarat high court gave a dressing down to the state government for poor health infrastructure management in the city of Ahmedabad, the government sought an urgent clarification about the HC order passed in the suo motu PIL on Covid-19 pandemic on Monday afternoon.The contents of the government note could not be learned as none of the lawyers involved in the suo motu PIL hearing were allowed to participate in the proceedings before the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora. Only two government law officers addressed the court. The exclusion of other lawyers in the proceedings by the high court registry has led them to file complaints before the chief justice and the registrar (judicial) about the alleged deliberate effort of exclusion in a hearing on a crucial matter.The amicus curie appointed by the high court in this matter, advocate Brijesh Trivedi too was kept out and he was quick to register his complaint in the HC registry. Other lawyers to complaint before the chief justice were senior counsel Anshin Desai and Parth Contractor. “It is with a sense of serious concern, that I make this complaint, with regard to the above subject matter,” the amicus curie said about the secrecy.The lawyers were unhappy because the registrar (judicial) informed senior advocate Desai that “the government pleader Manisha Lavkumar Shah has mentioned in a note or something that no one is required to be served with a copy, that no one else is concerned, and that ‘no notice’ or an advance copy to the other side is required”. The government pleader did not respond to repeated calls.While the amicus curie expressed shock over the manner in which the state government allegedly sought to conduct the matter without involving other parties, senior advocate Desai complained, “It seems that the court has been misled. Without a copy of any such application, the registry of Gujarat high court never permits circulation and in the past we have frantically pleaded to the registry in normal times for circulation, and even after the service of advance copy, immediate circulation is next to impossible. I wonder how such a circulation was permitted today?”Upon conclusion of the hearing, the HC did not make any alteration in its order, but it accepted documents concerning work at the Civil Hospital on record, sources said.
