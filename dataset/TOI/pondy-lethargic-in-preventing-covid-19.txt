‘Puducherry lethargic in preventing Covid-19’
2020-03-19
PUDUCHERRY: The opposition AIADMK party has accused the Congress government of acting in a lethargic manner in preventing the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Puducherry. AIADMK legislature party leader A Anbalagan told reporters on Wednesday that he will write to the Union health and family welfare ministry on Friday listing out the shortcomings of the government in taking effective measures to prevent the outbreak of the virus. 


He regretted that the cabinet was divided in closing all bars and restaurants from Wednesday. He claimed that the chief minister's decision to close the bars and restaurants from Wednesday was stalled by two ministers. He was of the opinion that the Puducherry government has been acting belatedly in tackling the issue. He urged the Puducherry district collector to impose Section 144 of the CrPc banning assembly of people to prevent the incidence of the virus. tnn
