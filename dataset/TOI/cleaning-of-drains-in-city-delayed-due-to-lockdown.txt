Cleaning of drains in city delayed due to lockdown
2020-06-10
Jaipur: With the monsoon just round the corner, 60% work of cleaning drains is still incomplete. This year, due to lockdown, the contract for drain cleaning was given by JMC only at the end of May. Last year, the contract was given in February.

As the process has been delayed, Jaipur is likely to have choked drains this monsoon. According to the officials, there are about 890 drains in the city, of them 300 are being cleaned. Due to the lockdown, JMC officials were busy in ration distribution and sanitisation activities around the city. Lack of manpower is another reason for delay in the process. District collector Joga Ram had on Monday asked JMC for the report on the progress of drain cleaning in the city.

JMC chief engineer Anil Singhal said, “We have sent the report and are expecting the work to be completed by June 30. Due to the lockdown, we initially had issues of getting labour which was resolved later. The work is in progress and will be completed soon.”

The contract was tendered for Rs 2.5 crore in May.

Drains which are more than 2.5ft deep are being desilted by the contractual workers. Other smaller drains are usually cleaned by the sanitation staff. Last year, JMC had started the work five months in advance. But this time, there have been complaints of water-logging in the city which have resulted in many accidents.
