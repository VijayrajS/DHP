2020-03-24
Prayagraj: Life came to a standstill as roads wore a deserted look and markets remained closed on the first day of lockdown of Prayagraj, along with 15 other districts in the state.

A large number of people were seen at kiosks in the morning buying milk, bread, egg and biscuits and vegetables. Vegetable prices also went up with tomato being sold at Rs 60 per kg, brinjal and ladyfingers at Rs 50, potato at Rs 30 and onion at Rs 40 per kg.

Vegetable sellers said limited stock was available in main markets like Mundera, Bakshi Bund and Khuladabad. “When I failed to get required vegetables at Mundera Mandi, I went to Khuldabad but police barricaded the road and did not allow me to move further,” said Sanjeev Kesarvani of Preetamnagar.

Most of the city areas witnessed normal commuting during morning hours and it was only after 10am that the administration realised that people were not refraining from venturing out. People were stopped from moving out and only those related with essential services or for any emergency were allowed to commute. .

DM Bhanu Chand Goswami said, “As this was the first day, we wanted people to stay indoors for their own safety. When we saw that lockdown was not being followed properly, we had to show some strictness.”

As railway authorities suspended operations of all passenger trains, Prayagraj Junction also wore a deserted look. Regional manager, UP state roadways transport corporation (UPSRTC), TK Bisen said: “No bus will operate from any of the bus stand of the district till the lockdown is in place.”
