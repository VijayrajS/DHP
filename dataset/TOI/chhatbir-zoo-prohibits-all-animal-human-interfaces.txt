People will not be allowed to visit the walk-in aviary, reptile enclosures and nocturnal houses. The footfall at the zoo has decreased by 40% in the past one week. 

Principal chief conservator of forests, Punjab, Kuldeep Kumar said, “We are taking major precautionary measures not only at Chhatbir, but at all the zoos of the state. At Chhatbir, we have decided to prohibit direct interface of humans with birds. We will be holding a meeting on Monday to take some more important decisions on the operations of zoos across the state.”

Chhatbir zoo field director M Sudhagar said as a precautionary measure, all employees have been directed to wear masks, gloves and use sanitisers, which are provided to them at the entry gates. The employees at the gate have also been given thermometers to check suspects. They have been directed not to let in even those with mild fever and to inform the nearest health department, he added. 

He said, “The walk-in aviary, reptile house and nocturnal house, where chances of infection are very high, have been put on the prohibition list. Directions have also been issued to check foreigners at the gate. Probably, the entry of foreigners may be disallowed once directions are received from the Punjab government.”

About the low footfall, he said, “On Saturday, we had just 2,000 visitors, while normally there are more than 4,000. On Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the footfall did not cross the 4,000-mark, which otherwise on an average is above 6,000. Health teams have been given standing orders to act swiftly during an emergency or if a suspect is traced inside the zoo, shift him/her to the nearest dispensary and inform the Mohali civil surgeon.”
