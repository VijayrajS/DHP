2020-03-30
LUCKNOW: Mosquito menace in the state’s capital is on the rise. The number of complaints related to fogging registered at Lucknow Municipal Corporation helpline have spiked by over 100% in eight days in comparison to earlier this month.


The civic body received around 131 complaints since March 18 till Friday for conducting fogging as compared to 54 complaints between March 1 and March 17.

Areas from where most complaints were received are Vikasnagar (34) , Niralangar (17), Aliganj (21), Lalbagh (19), Kaiserbagh (8) Yahiyaganj (11) and Rakabganj (21).

“Drains in my locality are choked with garbage serving as breeding grounds. We had complained to LMC on Thursday, but no help has come even after 24 hours, “ said Ishita Mukherjee, a resident of Aliganj Sector-K.

“We can protect ourselves from coronavirus by locking ourselves in our homes but rising mosquitoe menace is increasing risk of vector-borne diseases, “ said Deepak Mishra in Rakabganj.

Aniket Asthana, a resident of Jankipuram Sector-H, said, “If windows are left open, mosquitoes storm into the house, making it difficult to sit at one place. This year, they seem to have become resistant to repellents as nothing is working from coils to vapourisers. Only traditional mosquito nets are doing the job.”

LMC officials claim the civic body has already conducted drives to spray anti-larva in all eight zones of the city in January and February. LMC environment engineer Pankaj Bhusan said, “We have 21 fogging machine mounted trucks and 60 cycles. All of them are fogging daily in various areas of all 100 wards.”
