NEW DELHI: Two men who were distributing food in Mehrauli and delivering food to nearby areas have tested positive for Covid-19. Another person who was also working with them has cleared the virus test. 

They were tested when one of them developed fever recently. While the person with fever has been hospitalised, the other positive person has been sent to a Covid care centre. Their family members, who will also be tested, have been advised home isolation. The third person has been placed in an institutional quarantine facility. 

The South district authorities are trying to trace their contacts. Containment plans are being worked out in large areas, including Motilal Nehru Camp, Kishangarh car market, Church Road at Vasant Kunj and Pehalwan Dhaba at Mehrauli, a source said. 

Mehrauli MLA Naresh Yadav said they mainly collected food from a government facility and delivered it to three locations while others associated with different social organisations were engaged in distribution. They distributed food only at one spot, the AAP legislator added. “We gave them masks, gloves and hand sanitisers, and they always followed protocols,” Yadav said.

Meanwhile, two more containment zones were created in Delhi on Monday, taking the total count to 99. In South district, the areas under Nirankari Gali, Nakshtra Gali, Nala Boring Gali, Ravan Wali Gali, Jameela Masjid Baoli, Dargah Gurudwara Wali Gali, Thane Wali Gali and Terminal Wali Gali were declared as one zone while house nos. P-65 and P-184 in New Delhi district’s Pillanji village formed the other red zone.
