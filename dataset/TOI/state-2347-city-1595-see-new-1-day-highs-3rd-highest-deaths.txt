Coronavirus: Maharashtra, Mumbai see new 1-day highs, third highest deaths
2020-05-18
MUMBAI: Coronavirus infections saw their biggest single-day jump in the state and the city on Sunday.


Of 2,347 cases across Maharashtra, a lion’s share (1,595) came from Mumbai. Maharashtra’s Covid-19 incidence now stands at 33,053, while Mumbai has crossed the 20,000-mark to reach 20,150 cases. City’s tally has doubled from 10,000-odd to over 20,000 in 11 days, the same time it took to multiply from around 5,000 cases to over 10,000.

 


In effect, the doubling rate —an indication of how fast the virus is spreading through the community—has not slowed as much as authorities claim. A state official had said on Saturday that the doubling rate had increased to 13 days.

For the past 11 days, the state has reported cases in the range of 1,000-1,800 every day before the leap to 2,000-plus on Sunday. It has also reported its third highest number of deaths in a single day. On Sunday, there were 63 Covid-19 deaths in Maharashtra, which took its overall death toll to 1,198. With 38 deaths, Mumbai too recorded its third highest fatalities in 24 hours. Total deaths in the city have reached 734, accounting for 61% of the state’s mortality figures. 

As the outbreak entered the 70th day in Maharashtra on Sunday, the number of people discharged rose steadily, with over 5,000 patients going home in Mumbai alone.

On Sunday, 600 patients were discharged from hospitals across the state. State health minister Rajesh Tope said most were asymptomatic patients from hot spots such as Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Malegaon. Overall, 7,688 patients have been discharged from hospitals and a new policy implemented as directed by the Centre to discharge a patient on the tenth day instead of 14 days.

On the Mumbai situation, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said of the 1,595 fresh cases added on Sunday, 590 were reported between May 10 and 14. “We are now seeing 800-900 positive cases every day on an average. Important to note is that most cases are coming from the containment zones,” he said.

“Slum pockets have emerged as our biggest challenge as it’s difficult to get people to understand social distancing and hygiene practices,” he said, adding that many are also hiding symptoms and refusing to cooperate in door-to-door surveys fearing they would be taken to quarantine facilities. In addition to house-to-house-surveys, BMC is now planning to send mobile x-ray vans into slum communities to detect signs of pneumonia early.

Of the 38 deaths reported in Mumbai on Sunday, civic officials said 13 deaths occurred between May 8 and May 15. At least 23 had comorbidities. And of the total 63 in the state, remaining were from Pune (9), Aurangabad (6), three each in Solapur and Raigad, and one each in Thane, Panvel, Latur and Amaravati. Of the total deaths, 65% had co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. The case fatality rate for both the city and the state continued to be under 4%.

Looking at the mounting Covid-19 cases, the state on Sunday notified the extension of the lockdown up to May 31 even before the Centre announced its decision. The state will come up with new guidelines about the implementation of lockdown 4.0 in a day or two. Health minister Tope said while cases were rising, one should also look at the discharge figures.
