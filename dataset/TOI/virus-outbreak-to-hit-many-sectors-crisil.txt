Virus outbreak to hit many sectors: Crisil
2020-02-21
MUMBAI: Credit profiles of companies in sectors such as consumer durables, electronics, solar panels, auto components and diamonds could get impacted if the supply disruption from China due to the coronavirus epidemic continues beyond March, according to Crisil.


In a report on the economic impact of the viral outbreak, the rating agency said, “If not contained quickly, the epidemic will have a knock-on effect in the world economy and disrupt global supply chains. China is the world’s second-largest economy and a major trade partner for many countries, including India.”

According to Crisil, with the weather getting warmer over the next two months, the impact of the outbreak is expected to subside in China by April 2020. “In the worst case, the epidemic might well extend through the first quarter of fiscal 2021, intensifying the severity of impact,” Crisil said.

For Indian importers, supply disruption in key segments is the biggest threat. On the other side, exports to China are taking a hit, too. Export-import trade between India and China (including Hong Kong) was $115 billion in calendar year 2019.

 
 

Consumer durables, electronics, solar panels would be most hit, as they heavily depend on Chinese imports, with no immediate alternatives available. Besides, some impact on exporters of products such as cotton yarn, sea food, petrochemicals, gems and jewellery is inevitable, given that China is among the biggest markets for these products.

Sectors that are highly import-dependent from China, such as ceramics and plastics, are expected to benefit Indian domestic manufacturers, with import volumes reducing. Moreover, India’s steel, paper, leather and textile readymade garments segments have a window of opportunity to expand exports, as China’s own exports from these sectors account for a sizeable pie in global trade, which now stand impacted due to the coronavirus outbreak.
