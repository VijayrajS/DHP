Uttar Pradesh: Man, nephew killed over cricket complaint during lockdown
2020-05-22
BAREILLY: A man and his nephew were hacked to death by a youth in Bhulanpur village for not agreeing to bear witness in a complaint that said a local game of cricket broke Covid-19 lockdown rules.

It all started when the accused had made a complaint against a few locals who were playing cricket and the victims were eyewitnesses in that complaint. They later, however, refused to give a statement which angered the accused. The incident occurred under the jurisdiction of Neemgaon police station in Lakhimpur Kheri district. Kheri SSP Poonam visited the village to calm the locals. 

On Wednesday afternoon, the accused Anil Maurya, 22, had an argument with the eyewitnesses - Brij Bihari Maurya, 45, and his uncle Ramgopal Maurya, 65 - over the same issue and later at night, he allegedly killed them with an axe. Police have caught the accused on Thursday and he claimed that he lodged the complaint only after getting an assurance from the victims who belonged to the same neighbourhood. 

Notably, the accused had made the complaint against a few locals for playing cricket earlier in the month. He had prepared a video clip as well. On Monday, the locals playing cricket had allegedly beaten up Anil and asked him to withdraw his complaint and later police booked both the parties for "disturbance of peace". 

SHO of Neemgaon police station Raj Kumar told TOI, “We have arrested the accused Anil Maurya. The victims were known to him. The accused has admitted to his crime. We have recorded the statement of a few eyewitnesses and he will be presented in court on Friday.”

In a late development, SSP has transferred sub-inspector Haridas Chaurasia, in-charge of Behjam police outpost, to reserve police lines for "negligence". Chaurasia has been replaced by SI Dinesh Kumar Singh.
