2020-04-16
KOLKATA: Bikash Sonkar of Parbati Ghosh Lane near Machuabazar and Atig Chatterjee of Mohun Bagan Lane may be staying around 10km far from each other, but the duo, along with hundreds of their neighbours in central and north Kolkata, became perfect role models for lakhs of people. In the past couple of days, they have thwarted the entry of outsiders in their localities to make way for “perfect lockdown”. 


In a city that has witnessed over 7,000 FIRs and 16,000 arrests so far for various lock down violations, this little effort of residents in two localities impressed the police, who have promised to lend a helping hand to them. 

"Our area is located in a densely populated place. Many people used to assemble in our lane throughout the day. So, we decided to stop their gathering and maintain social distancing for the safety of our children. We requested the local police to put up barricades and keep vigil in our area to prevent the entry of outsiders ,” said Sonkar.

Since the administration took hectic measures to contain the possibility of Covid-19 outbreak in Belgachhia slum, there was a sense of helplessness the Mohun Bagan Lane residents, Chatterjee said. “But when the administration explained to us the ground reality, we decided to stand beside them. We have put up ‘No Entry’ posters for outsiders and keeping a strict vigil in the area,” he added. A hand-written notice board warns outsiders not to come there.

Locals of Jorasanko near Thantania Kalibari made a WhatsApp group where locals share information about the movement of outsiders.
