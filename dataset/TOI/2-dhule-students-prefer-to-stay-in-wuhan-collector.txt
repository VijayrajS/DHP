NASHIK: The Dhule district administration has said that two local students studying in Wuhan are in good condition and that they prefer to stay in the Chinese city that is the epicentre of coronovirus.

Girish Patil and Chandradeep Jadhav, both 29 years old, are pursuing higher studies at Wuhan University of Science and Technology. 

The students, who ere selected by the university under its fellowship programme, completed their masters in science before travelling to Wuhan in November last year. 

They chose to stay back when the Union government had sent two special Air India flights to evacuate Indians from Wuhan. The government evacuated more than 600 Indians.

Dhule district collector Gangatharan Devrajan told TOI that he spoke to both the students a couple of days ago. “They told me that they are in good shape and although the city is under lockdown, they have sufficient stock of food and other essentials.”

Devrajan quoted the students as saying that there is nothing to worry about. “I told them that in case of any emergency, they must get in touch with me immediately, without any hesitation,” said the district collector, who has shared his contact number with the students. 

While Girish is a resident of Dhule town, Jadhav is from Simkheda taluka of the district. 

Tejpal Girase, a social worker from Dhule, said that he is touch with the two students and their family members. “Both of them told me that they do not want return as their studies would suffer. They share one room in the university hostel and the local authorities at Wuhan city are taking proper care. They believe that there is no reason to panic,” he said. 

Girase added that the students’ and their families are in constant touch.
