NEW DELHI: The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Delhi rose up to eight on Tuesday, with a man in his 40s who lives in south Delhi’s Saket testing positive for the disease. He had travelled to Singapore in February and to Canada in March, said an official. “Two of his family members are being tested for infection,” he added.


Of the seven people found positive for Covid-19 in Delhi before this, two have been discharged already. They were admitted to Safdarjung Hospital. Four others are still admitted and their condition is stable, said a source.

One 68-year-old woman, who had tested positive, succumbed to the infection. The woman’s son had recently returned from Europe and had earlier tested positive for the virus too.

“The death of a 68-year-old woman from west Delhi is confirmed to be caused due to co-morbidity (diabetes and hypertension). She had also tested positive for Covid-19,” the health ministry said.

Delhi government officials said about 50 houses in the neighbourhood of the woman have been surveyed and surveillance officers were keeping a close watch on anyone who may have come in contact with the mother and son.
