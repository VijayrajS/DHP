2020-05-23
JAIPUR: As many as 390 migrants were shifted from home quarantine to institutional quarantine after they flouted norms in the past few days. 

“People who are in home quarantine are strictly monitored and those who violate it are first counselled and then sent to institutional quarantine. Monitoring of people in home quarantine is done through Covid Quarantine Alert System (CQAS) through the department of information and technology (DoIT). If any person breaches the quarantine, then information is received on CQAS and immediately action is taken,” said Veenu Gupta, head of a state-level quarantine committee constituted by the state government. 

The state government has made provisions for all the migrant labourers returning to the state to stay quarantined for 14 days. These labourers are screened while entering the border of the state and if no symptoms are found then they are asked to remain in home quarantine. If they have influenza-like symptoms, the person is sent to institutional quarantine.
