Bareilly: A day after Bareilly reported its first covid-19 positive case, over 200 people, including a few regular patients, suffering from fever and cough visited the flu clinic at the district hospital in the first shift on Monday. Chief medical superintendent Dr TS Arya said, “More than 200 patients visited the flu clinic on Monday and everyone was treated. A team of four doctors are attending the patients in the first shift, but as the number of patients in the second shift is usually reduces, two doctors are available at the flu clinic.”Dr Vageesh Vaish, senior consultant and physician at the district hospital, said, “The first case of novel coronavirus has created panic among a section of people, and hence, the number of patients at the flu clinic suddenly increased. Although all patients were given medicines, we did not collect their samples for covid-19 test as they had neither visited a foreign country nor did they come in contact with suspected cases.”On Sunday, a 34-year-old native of Subhash Nagar locality was tested positive for Covid-19. He works in a Noida-based company where his colleagues were also tested positive with novel coronavirus.
