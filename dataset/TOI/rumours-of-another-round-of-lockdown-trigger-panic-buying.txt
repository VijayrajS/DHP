Agra: Rumours of another round of lockdown amid increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Agra has triggered panic buying.

According to wholesalers, panic buying is taking place as residents see the possibility of yet another lockdown in Agra. Banking on the previous lockdown experience when they ran out of groceries and other required items, residents don’t want to face a similar situation again, and thus, they are indulging in panic buying, the wholesalers added.

Ashok Kumar, Motiganj market-based grocery retailer, said, “Most of my regular customers are buying groceries for up to three months as they are worried that another round of lockdown can be enforced. For a past couple of days we have been witnessing the trend of panic buying among our customers.”

Bodla-based daily need store owner Vinod Agarwal said, “Orders placed by costumers have surprisingly increased in the past two-three days. People are stocking food and daily need items after rumours of another round of lockdown. To avoid gathering at the store, we are taking orders over the phone and asking the customers to pick up their order at a specific time.” 

The items which are in high demand include flour, rice, pulses, spices, packed food, hosiery, cosmetics and hardware products. 

Additional district magistrate Prabhakant Awasthi said, “Since June 3, markets and shops have been operating across Agra district, except in Covid containment zones. To avoid gathering, shops are required to operate on alternate days. A schedule has been fixed at the level of police stations.”

“As of now, there is no plan to enforce lockdown. Thus, people need not to panic over rumours. Sufficient stocks are available in the market. Besides, we are keeping a tab on social media platforms, and action will be taken against those who are found spreading the lockdown rumours.”
