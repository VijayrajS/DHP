Dehradun: A day after a vendor at city’s Niranjpur Mandi was tested positive for Covid-19, the vegetable market wore a deserted look on Friday. The office bearers kept the market closed on the day as a precaution measure and conducted sanitisation drive across the market.

Talking to TOI, Rajesh Sharma, president of Uttarakhand Mandi Samiti, Dehradun, said “The closure will not have much of an impact on the trade. The teams will carry out sanitisation drive for two-to-three days before the market re-opens on Tuesday. We have already written to the health department asking them to conduct random survey of people as a precaution.” 

The vegetable market will be operational only on Saturday after which it will be closed on Sunday as it the weekly-off day and on Monday as it is Eid-ul-Fitr. In addition to this, the officials claimed that more precautionary measures will be taken after the market re-opens on Tuesday. 

Vijay Thapliyal, secretary of Mandi Samiti, told TOI, “We will be ensuring thermal scanning before allowing entry to traders, loaders, and drivers. Along with touch-free sanitising machines, the sodium hypochlorite solution will sprayed in the market for the next few days. The traders with godowns have been asked to remove all the stock of vegetables and other goods for the sanitisation drive. Additionally, the 2,200 new mandi passes that were issued recently will be reduced to 1,500. Sanitising hands and wearing mask will be followed as a standard practice.”
