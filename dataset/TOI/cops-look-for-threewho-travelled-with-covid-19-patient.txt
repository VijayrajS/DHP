Vijayawada: With the first corona positive case being confirmed in the city, officials of Krishna and Guntur districts are on the lookout for three others who travelled with the person in the same car to Guntur from Vijayawada. The car was hired by the 23-year-old person who had returned to Vijayawada from Paris.

Krishna district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz said after the person deboarded at Vijayawada, three people, including the cab driver, travelled to Guntur. “We appeal to those who travelled from Vijayawada to Guntur on March 17 to come forward and undergo tests and stay in isolation as they might have contracted the disease. It would be easier for the authorities if they come forward voluntarily instead of them being tracked down and shifted to isolation,” he said. 

The collector said the district administration is on high alert and a community screening is being done in the neighbourhood of the person who has tested positive. Officials are trying to trace the people who came in contact with the person, said Imtiaz

Meanwhile, city police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said section 144 has been imposed in the city in view of the first positive case being reported.
