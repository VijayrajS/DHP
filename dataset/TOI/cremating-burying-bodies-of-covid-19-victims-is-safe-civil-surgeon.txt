Times News NetworkMohali: There is no chance of transmission of coronavirus in a crematorium or burial area, the district health department said in a public advisory. Clearing people’s doubts over cremation of Covid-19 victims, civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said the infection is mainly transmitted through droplets. There is no risk of Covid-19 infection from a dead body to health workers, family members or people in the locality who follow standard precautions while handling the body. “Temperature generated during burning of bodies is 800 to 1,000 degrees Celsius, in which the deadly virus can no longer remain viable,” the advisory said. It quoted from World Health Organisation and Union health ministry guidelines to press the point that there is no evidence of people catching infection from bodies of those who die of Covid-19. Dr Manjit Singh said that if the protocol prescribed for transportation and disposal of bodies of Covid-19 positive persons is followed, there is no risk of any infection. He urged people not to panic as cremation of Covid-19 positive patient’s body does not pose any additional threat and even the ash does not pose any risk.
