PATNA: Lok Janshakti party (LJP) president and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Saturday called for formulation of a common minimum programme (CMP) for the smooth functioning of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the assembly elections in the state. Amid coronavirus scare in the country, Chirag also raised concern over health infrastructure in Bihar.


“I will be meet CM Nitish Kumar after completing my yatra and convey to him the suggestions given by people,” Chirag said.

Chirag, who had postponed his ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ yatra due to coronavirus threat, said the government should make proper arrangements at hospitals to fight the menace.

Sharing his experience from the yatra, Chirag said, “People told me that district hospitals lack basic equipment like machine to measure blood pressure. Even if equipment are made available, there are no experts to handle them. There is dearth of doctors in spite of sanctioned posts.”

Chirag, however, said Nitish had done a lot in the last 15 years, but there were still scopes to improve.
