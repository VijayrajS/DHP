With Wednesday’s addition, Maharashtra’s toll climbed to 1,897. Mumbai contributed 32 of the 105 deaths, taking the city’s fatality numbers to 1,097.


State officials attributed the high fatalities to book-keeping and said that of the total deaths reported on Wednesday, 39 occurred in the last two days and the remaining 66 were from the period April 21 to May 24. Of the 32 deaths in Mumbai, 21 were from April 21 to May 24.

Mumbai reported 1,097 cases on Wednesday, taking its total cases to 34,018. After recording a jump of 3,041 cases on May 24, positive cases have marginally reduced in the state and the city. Mumbai, for instance, has recorded 1,097 and 1,002 cases in the last two days, a respite from the positive cases in the range of 1500-1700 earlier. 

The state’s public health department said that the doubling rate, which was 11.5 days till last week, had increased to 14.7 days as on Wednesday. Also, the discharge rate of the state had climbed to 31% from the 26% last week. In Mumbai, over 9,000 people have recovered and gone home.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the civic corporation was closely monitoring the doubling rate, which has been getting better in certain wards. “In terms of early disease detection, we have also started mobile x-ray clinics in Dharavi on Wednesday. We will soon be deploying more mobile x-ray facilities across the high-density pockets,” he said. Kakani added that the jumbo facility at the MMRDA grounds in Bandra has started admitting patients, and currently 40 are under treatment there.

Cases in rural parts of the state were going up after many people from the red zones were going back to their hometowns. Returnees from Mumbai, Pune and other hotspots like Malegaon started reaching their native villages/towns in Vidarbha from May 17 onwards. A sudden surge in number of cases, especially in the rural areas, has been witnessed in the region since. Especially, tribal-dominated districts like Gondia, Gadchiroli and Bhandara have been hit as returnees have tested positive.

Maharashtra, as on Wednesday, had 72 labs conducting Covid-19 swab tests, and 12.5% of the total tests conducted in the country were done in the state, officials said. Maharashtra has conducted 3,142 tests per million population against the national figure of 2,363 tests per million population, officials said.
