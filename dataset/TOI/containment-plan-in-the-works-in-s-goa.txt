MARGAO: South Goa collector Ajit Roy on Thursday emphasised on the need for administrative offices and local self-governance bodies to create awareness about prevention of coronavirus.

After chairing a meeting with officials of the department of health services, chief officers and block development officers (BDOs), at which members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) were also present, Roy told TOI that it was prevailed upon the officers that any suspects have to be notified to the health authorities and taken to GMC immediately.

Stating that there was no need to panic, Roy urged people to follow all precautionary measures and good hygiene to fight the pandemic. “It was explained to officials that the most effective way to monitor the situation and prevent the spread was at the level of the local bodies,” Roy said. 

Measures such as containment plans for clusters of coronavirus cases and monitoring home quarantined patients were also discussed.
