Vibrant Holi mood gets tinged with virus concerns
2020-03-10
Ahmedabad: On Monday, hundreds of bonfires across the city marked the first day of the two-day Holi festival. Holika Dahan events at scores of spots were organized. The theme of many events was COVID-19, with people offering herbs and medicines to the holy fire with the hope that it would ‘purify’ the air and keep the viral infection at bay.

At Godrej Garden City near SG Road, residents torched an effigy of the virus. The organizers said that children displayed placards that spread awareness about COVID-19.

Akshat Mandaliya, a resident of Vastrapur, said that his group had offered herbs and substances with medicinal properties including cow dung, camphor, and guggul to the fire. “It’s about faith that the bonfire will purify the air,” he said. “We are going to scale down dhuleti celebrations on Tuesday and will exercise caution.”

While several rain dance events and mass celebrations have already been cancelled, many housing societies will go ahead with get-togethers, feasts, and colour play on a reduced scale. “We are aware of the COVID-19 scare but we cannot stop the children from enjoying the annual fare,” said Vaibhav Parikh, a resident of Vejalpur. “We have, however, ensured that those who play do not have a recent history of illness.”

EMRI 108 officials said that they have issued an advisory. “We have urged citizens not to play without applying moisturiser to the skin and oil to the hair. We have also advised the use of sunglasses,” said a senior official. “Don’t take bhang or any such substance. Don’t play with strangers and keep an eye on miscreants.” Several temples in the city have organized special dolotsav.
