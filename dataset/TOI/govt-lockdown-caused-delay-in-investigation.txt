Lucknow: The UP government on Tuesday admitted that they missed out on timely investigation in the case of Anamika Shukla due to the lockdown. Shukla, a full-time science teacher, who worked at 25 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) simultaneously, allegedly swindled nearly Rs 1crore as salary within 13 months.

In a press briefing called by UP’s basic education minister Satish Dwivedi, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi said, “Is mamle me ek chook ye hai ki March me jab karyawahi honichahiye thi tab ho gai hoti (In this case action should have been initiated in March itself).”

Awasthi added, “But the lockdown had come. These teachers are hired on one-year's contract and their appointment is done at district level. No one found guilty will be spared.”

DG, school education, Vijay Kiran Anand said that on March 11, he wrote to assistant directors, basic education, of Ayodhya, Saharanpur, Meerut, Aligarh and Prayagraj divisions to investigate the case. 

“Due to the lockdown, records couldn’t be traced,” Anand said. Subsequently, a reminder was sent to the officials on May 26.

According to the basic education minister, Rs 12,24,700 has been withdrawn as salary in the name ofAnamika Shukla in nine districts. 

He said that soon after assuming the power the Yogi government had launched a drive to end the practice of appointing proxy teachers in the state.

Dwivedi accused the Opposition of politicising recruitment of 69,000 assistant teachers with intention of holding it for long.
