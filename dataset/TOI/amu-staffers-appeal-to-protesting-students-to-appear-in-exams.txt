AMU staffers appeal to protesting students to appear in exams
2020-01-25
AGRA: Over 100 staffers of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have appealed to the protesting students to appear for examinations which have been rescheduled twice. The pending examinations are scheduled to start from Monday. 

Initially, the examinations were scheduled after the university opened following extended winter vacations due to the December 15 violence that erupted on the campus. However, it was postponed due to continuous protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) by students who also demanded the vice-chancellor and registrar to resign from their posts as they failed to protect students on the ill-fated day.

“We the members of CWC project, CIC/GPS surveyors and non-teaching staff appeal to the students to save their future by appearing for the exams and not let vested interests damage the image of AMU,” coordinator, GIS/GPS Work of Waqf Board Properties, ‘Qaumi Waqf Board Taraqqiati Scheme’, Interdisciplinary Department of Remote Sensing and GIS Applications, Prof Shadab Khurshid said.

A signed memorandum said: “Our country is globally respected for democratic credentials, freedom to protest, commitment to pluralism and a progressive and secular constitution. We caution all our peace loving and cultured students against false propaganda and fake news and to exercise maximum restraint to maintain peace and tranquility on the campus.”
