UP: Covid takes a toll on Saubhagya scheme
2020-04-18
LUCKNOW: The pandemic triggered lockdown has gridlocked the Centre’s flagship Saubhagya scheme, which powered BJP’s poll juggernaut in 2017 assembly elections in UP with its last-mile electricity connectivity to households.

UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) sources said, Saubhagya’s second phase aims at electrification of 12 lakh more rural households this summer. While the state energy department managed to provide power to 5.5 lakh households, there’s uncertainty over its outreach to 6.5 lakh houses.

A senior UPPCL official said, work on the Saubhagya has come to a grinding halt because of the pandemic. “It’s a wait-and-watch situation with power employees unable to venture out to complete Saubhagya-2,” he said. Success of the scheme was being touted as BJP’s major poll plank before 2022 assembly elections after it reaped rich political dividends in both 2017 assembly poll and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

“The ambiguity over meeting Saubhagya-2 targets in the wake of pandemic is a big issue for the state government,” admitted a senior UPPCL official. Energy minister Srikant Sharma, however, maintained there would be no hurdles in the ongoing work to lend a thrust to power generation units, following Centre’s guidelines to begin work from April 20. “These are inhouse projects which will be carried out,” he said. He said even construction of transmission sub-stations and high tension lines continue to be taken up by the energy department.

Allaying apprehension that maintenance of the power distribution system may not be carried out because of lockdown, Sharma said, the department has asked engineers and contractual labourers to ensure maintenance in time of emergency. “We have asked the department to provide adequate security measures, including sanitisers and masks to ground staff,” he said.
