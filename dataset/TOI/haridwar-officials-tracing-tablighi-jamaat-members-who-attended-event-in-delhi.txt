HARIDWAR: After six coronavirus-positive Tablighi Jamaat members died in Telangana, city administration has sounded an alert and is tracing the members of the congregation from Uttarakhand who attended a religious event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin with infected patients. The event was reportedly attended by about 2,000 Tablighi Jamaat members from March 13 to March 15.


According to sources, 34 state residents, who are part of the group, attended the religious event at Nizamuddin. Among them, 26 members (12 from Dehradun, 11 from Haridwar, and 3 from Uttarkashi) have been quarantined in Delhi. The other eight Tablighi Jamaat members from the state are still missing.

Abhay Singh, circle officer, Haridwar, told TOI, “We are collecting information from the local unit of Tablighi Jamaat and have asked them to provide data of all those who went to take part in the religious event in Delhi. So far, 26 members from the state have been quarantined in Delhi. We are tracing the rest of them and they will be quarantined as soon as possible.”

Meanwhile, the local intelligence unit is also tracing those members of Tablighi Jamaat who had reached Haridwar from other states before the lockdown. Such members might also be quarantined. According to sources, 14 members of the congregation had come to Haridwar from different states to preach in city mosques.

Haridwar DM C Ravishankar told TOI, “We are tracing all the members of the Jamaat who had come to Haridwar before the lockdown and they will be quarantined soon.”
