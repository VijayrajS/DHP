RAJKOT: Bhavnagar couple’s puppets are being a great source of stress-buster for the children during the lockdown. While the puppet videos entertain the kids, they also teach them about many a thing. 


Piyush Vyas and his wife Rekha have been into puppetry for the past two decades or more, supplying the string dolls all over the state and outside too. Their puppets are based on children stories and are sold in various schools. During the lockdown the puppeteers couple decided to contribute something to the society their way.

“The importance of puppets in children education is well proven. But this time we decided to do something more that will help our puppets spread awareness too. Hence, we prepared a script taking content from government guidelines and did a voice over,” said Piyush. So, puppets in the form of Gandhiji, and even Lord Ganesha are teaching kids how to deal with adversaries and overcome crisis with bravery. 

“An epidemic like this broke out in the Satyug too. We are describing how the people had then faced it with courage. When people are watching Ramayana and Mahabharat on the television, we wanted Ganesha too to give people the message,” said Rekha, adding that she had been suffering from bronchitis for the past decade. “However, I did not stop making puppets because it’s my passion. This work requires manual stitching of cotton which I do by wearing a mask. Now, I have almost forgot about my illness,” she added. 

The couple has put nearly three video messages on various social media platform and have got very good response. They are now in the process of making a puppet of PM Narendra Modi who will give the message of how to stay safe and how to be helpful.
