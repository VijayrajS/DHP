PATNA: Samples of altogether 182 persons who came to Bihar from various countries on or after March 18, were found Covid-19 negative on Monday. Of the total samples, around 46 were collected in Gaya.


Director, Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, Dr Pradeep Das, said that samples of 182 people, who returned from abroad earlier this month, were tested in the institute. “All the samples that were tested on Monday were of asymptomatic people who returned from foreign countries few days back,” he said.

Earlier samples of only those with symptoms similar to Covid-19 were tested. But now samples of all those who entered the state on or after March 18 are being tested. “Most of the samples came from from Gaya, Vaishali, Gopalganj and Darbhanga. All these persons had returned to their native places in Bihar from foreign countries where they worked as daily wage earners, technicians etc. They have been asked to complete the 14-day home quarantine period,” Dr Das said.

State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ragini Mishra said, “So far, 869 samples were tested at RMRI, Patna, of which 840 were found negative and 15 were positive. Results of 11 samples are awaited, while three were rejected on several grounds,” she said.
