2020-05-07
Nagpur: The lockdown has come as a blessing in disguise for the Nagpur division of South East Central Railway (SECR) with the engineering department carrying out track maintenance works for over 1,200km in the last one month.

From March 24 to May 4, the division, from Itwari to Durg, carried out track works with various machines. “We did plain track tamping for 415km with different track machines. It included correction of alignment and correction of longitudinal and cross levels, besides packing under the sleepers,” said SECR officials.

They added that the turnout tamping was also done. Machines were also used to achieve a proper level, particularly at the crossing portion. “We did ballast profiling for 138km and track stabilization work in 92km. We also lifted 5,051 pieces of rails and sleepers from the section and stacked them at the proper place with the help of machines,” they said.

“During the routine course of time, getting blocks for various works is difficult due to the continuous movement of mail/express trains. But due to the lockdown, we got 90% space to complete these works,” SECR officials said. 

Defective rails and welds have been removed and now Nagpur division is free from these defects. The trackmen also renewed CMS crossings and ballast has been trained out besides removing of dilapidated channel sleepers and defective glued joints have been replaced.
