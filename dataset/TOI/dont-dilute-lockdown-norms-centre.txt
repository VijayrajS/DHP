Don't dilute lockdown norms: Centre to states
2020-04-16
NEW DELHI: The home ministry wrote to all states and Union territories on Wednesday emphasising that the revised lockdown guidelines issued by it cannot be diluted, though stricter measures can be enforced as per requirement of specific areas. 


 In a communication to state chief secretaries, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said the additional activities allowed under the revised norms in non-hotspot areas may not be permitted in containment zones demarcated by states and UTs as per guidelines of the health and family welfare ministry. 

Also, if any new area is demarcated as a containment zone, the activities allowed there till such time will be suspended except for those which are specifically permitted under the revised guidelines. The activities allowed will be withdrawn immediately if any lockdown measures are violated, risking spread of Covid-19. 

"All entities, in the government and private sectors, and members of the public should follow the guidelines strictly," Bhalla said while urging the states/UTs to ensure compliance of the instructions and direct all authorities concerned for their strict implementation.
