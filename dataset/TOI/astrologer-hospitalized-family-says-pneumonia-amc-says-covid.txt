AHMEDABAD: A nationally renowned astrologer has been admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad for the last few days with pneumonia and brain hypoxia, according to his son. 

The ninety-year old, one of Asia’s most widely read astrology columnists, tested positive for Covid-19 on May 22 according to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s list of patients. The family, however, denies this.

“My father has pneumonia and doctors are currently treating him to restore oxygen supply to his brain. I reject the claims and rumours that he has coronavirus,” the son said. 

The ninety-year old, whose name figured among the 100 great astrologers of the last 1,000 years in ‘The Millennium Book of Prophecy’, published by Harper Collins, is said to have accurately forecast some successes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, film actor Amitabh Bachchan and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, among others.

Sources aware of the matter said the astrologer has been admitted to a special Covid-19 facility at a private hospital on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.

In a video posted online in the second week of April, the astrologer had predicted that the challenges of the Covid-19 situation would last only till May. “After May 21, this disease is expected to go away,” he had said. 

The astrologer was admitted to a hospital in Ahmedabad for a brain stroke last year, from which he seemed to have recovered, sources said.
