The latest Covid-19 patients are from the Nashik rural police and State Reserve Police Force (SRPF). With this, the total police and SRPF personnel infected with coronavirus while performing their duties in Malegoan has crossed 130.

Out of the 24 personnel, 16 are residents of Nashik city, attached to the rural police and performing their duty in Malegoan, said a release issued by the district administration. The others are six jawans of Jalna SRPF and two of Amravati SRPF.

Teams of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have taken up the work of tracing the contacts of the personnel from the city and begun sealing the residential areas of the police personnel testing positive. Additional superintendent of police Sandeep Ghuge said one of the reason for the high infection is that the personnel are performing their duty in the containment zones.

A team of five officials and 25 policemen has been set up only to ensure to that police personnel on bandobast do not lack any facility.
