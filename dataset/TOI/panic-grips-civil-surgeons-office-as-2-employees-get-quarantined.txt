JAMSHEDPUR: Two employees at the East Singhbum district civil surgeon’s office have been put in home quarantine after it emerged that they had come in contact of the two Kolkata-return youngsters whose swab samples tested positive. The duo had collected swab samples from the youths after the latter returned to Chakulia by road.

As one of the employees lives in Ghatshila and the other in Chakulia, and they had travelled to and fro from their Jamshedpur office, efforts are on to trace the people they had come in contact with in the last few days.

Civil surgeon Dr Rameshwar Prasad told TOI that his office has been sanitised. He also urged residents of the Steel City to refrain from unnecessarily venturing out of their homes.

Prasad said many people, especially youths, were violating lockdown norms.

He cautioned the residents and said that East Singhbhum is no longer a green zone, and it has turned turned orange after the two Covid-19 cases surfaced.

Chakulia is a part of the Baharagora assembly constituency that is located close to the borders of West Bengal and Odisha. On Wednesady, former Baharagora MLA Kunal Sarangi demanded proper screening of people entering Jharkhand through East Singhbhum.

Meanwhile, 12 people from Makdampur area in Jamshedpur, who had gone to Asansol in West Bengal to attend a marriage ceremony, have been put in an isolation camp in Jugsalai, after they returned to the Steel City.

Health department sources said their swab samples have been collected and sent for testing.
