2020-04-30
JODHPUR: With ban on tobacco products in the wake of Covid-19 breakout and unavailability of the products to habitual users due to lockdown, public health experts have termed this occasion a once in a lifetime opportunity to give a serious thought to quitting and discouraging the use of tobacco consumption.

Hailing the state government’s move to ban the use of tobacco products and spitting in public places to prevent spread of coronavirus, they have been advocating to consider the ban to make it permanent.

R C Sahni, a preventive oncologist and a President awardee, urged all smokers and tobacco users to avail this opportunity to quit tobacco consumption.

“A survey conducted in Rajasthan’s government hospitals has revealed that 37% patients here are with diseases caused due to tobacco. Weakened immune system because of tobacco consumption is a major cause of a number of chronic health conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes,” Sahni said. An activist associated with the cause, Rajkumar Khatri, said that quitting tobacco will not only reduce the burden on the state exchequer by 30%, but also lead to better immune system to fight Covid-19.
