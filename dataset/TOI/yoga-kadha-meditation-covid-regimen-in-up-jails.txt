Yoga, kadha & meditation: Covid regimen in UP jails
2020-05-09
PRAYAGRAJ: The rapidly increasing tally of novel coronavirus cases in the state has alerted jail authorities who are fretful of the fallouts of Covid-19 outbreak within the prison walls and are taking preventive steps besides social distancing to ensure all staff and inmates stay healthy.

Around 750 inmates lodged in Kaushambi district jail start their day with an hour long yoga session after which they are served a ‘kadha’ to boost their immunity.

B S Mukund, superintendent of Kaushambi district jail told TOI, “All the inmates below age of 50 years in our jail are attending daily yoga session in barracks and park from 6.30am to 7.30 am. This helps them keep fit, boosts their immunity and beats depression.”

“Social distancing is strictly followed during the yoga session in the park within the district jail. The inmates also wear masks during yoga session,” the jail superintendent said.

The inmates are also served a kadha (decoction) made from Tulsi (Basil), Dalchini (cinnamon), Kalimirch (black pepper), Shunthi (dry ginger), fresh lemon juice and munakka (raisin) to boost their immunity, he added.

“At a time when cases of Covid-19 infection are increasing rapidly across the state, jail authorities have taken up all preventive measures to check its spread, especially in jails,” said Mukund.

As there is no medicine for Covid-19, jail authorities decided to take all preventive measures.

“We have adopted ayurvedic measures of boosting immunity of inmates. The Ayush ministry has issued recommendations and advised ways to boost body’s natural defence system. So, we started preparing and serving kadha to inmates,” he added.

The inmates practise Yogasanas, Pranayam and meditation for at least 30 minutes in their barracks also.
