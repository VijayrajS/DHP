HYDERABAD: With Kerala reporting five more positive cases of coronavirus (Covid-19), health minister Eatala Rajender visited the Government General and Chest Hospital at Erragadda on Sunday and inspected the arrangements in place for a separate isolation ward in the hospital. 

“Dedicate a building that is at a distance from all other blocks to conduct tests and treat people who come with symptoms. No passageway to the isolated building should be linked to the other blocks,” the minister said, adding that more beds should be made available in the isolation wards.

The hospital authorities informed the minister that a two-floored building with four wards has been identified as an isolation centre at the chest hospital. Currently there are eight ventilators and 56 beds available at the centre. However, Rajender asked them to arrange for four individual rooms. 

The decision to designate a hospital exclusively for Covid-19 patients was taken on Tuesday after the health minister held a review meeting with municipal administration and urban development as well as panchayat raj and rural development departments.

Meanwhile, a 12-member team that went to Kerala on Thursday to understand the measures taken by the government to prevent outbreak, returned to the city on Sunday. The team, headed by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) additional commissioner B Santosh, includes superintendent of Gandhi Hospital P Shravan Kumar, Hyderabad district medical and health officer J Venkat, and Chest Hospital superintendent Dr Mahaboob Khan.
