The health of the people arriving in the state will be monitored regularly and samples will be taken accordingly. 

Health minister Raghu Sharma said that those students, tourists and NRIs stuck in different countries will start to arrive in the state. The airports, which have been identified, where the flights will land are Jaipur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Udaipur. Sharma said, “The passengers will be quarantined at the same city where they will land as per the Centre’s guidelines.” 

The state government has identified hotels and other places near the airport, where they will be quarantined. 

Ever since migrants have started arriving from other states, the state has been witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases. There are 20 lakh people who have registered for arriving in the state. On the other hand, 20 lakh have also registered to go out of the state.
