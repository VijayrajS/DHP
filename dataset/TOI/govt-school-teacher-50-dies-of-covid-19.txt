NEW DELHI: A 50-year-old English teacher on Sunday became the first casualty to Covid-19 in a Delhi government school.

Shivji Mishra, who worked at a school in east Delhi’s Kalyanvas, was the sole breadwinner of his family. Following his death, Government School Teachers’ Association (GSTA) has demanded compensation for his family and a government job for one of the children or his wife.

A resident of Kalyanpuri, Mishra is survived by his wife and two sons. While the elder son is in college, the younger one studies in Class XII.

Ayush Mishra, the younger son, told TOI, “We got a call from Safdarjung Hospital at 3pm informing us about his death. He was first admitted to a nearby private hospital on May 22. After a few days the hospital asked us to take him away. We tried to get him admitted to several hospitals, but none of them had empty beds. On June 5, we took him to Safdarjung.” Since the lockdown, Mishra was deployed at the ration distribution centre and from May 19 to 21 he was ferrying migrants. “He fell ill on May 21. He didn’t have any other illnesses,” said 16-year-old Ayush.

Ajay Veer Yadav, GSTA general secretary, said Mishra was the first teacher to have died of Covid-19. Earlier, a teacher who died also had another illness. “Mishra lost his life while performing his duty. The government had announced ex gratia of Rs 1 crore for a government servant who dies on duty. We hope the promise is fulfilled,” he added.
