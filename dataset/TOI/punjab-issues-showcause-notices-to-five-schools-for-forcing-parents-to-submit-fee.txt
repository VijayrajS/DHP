CHANDIGARH: Taking serious note of private schools defying directions issued in wake of coronavirus outbreak, the Punjab government initiated action against five schools.

These schools were forcing parents to pay fees during the lockdown period. The education department has issued showcause notices to the erring parties - La Foundation School Sangrur, DAV Public School Bhupindra Road Patiala, Bhupindra International School Patiala, Delhi Public School Ludhiana, Angels Paradise School Amritsar and Mount Litera Zee School Faridkot – after receiving complaints from parents.

Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “Showcause notices have been issued to the violators and they have been given seven-day time to file their reply. If they failed to give satisfactory reply, the department will cancel their affiliation.”

The education minister also cautioned other schools not to defy instructions and said that if any violation will come to light in future, the erring school would be sealed by the district magistrate before seeking any reply.

Singla said that the education department had issued an order March 23 directing schools to provide window period of at least 30 days for submission of fees after the situation gets normal. He said that the schools have also been directed not to charge any late fees or fine from the students for this period. He added that after the issuance of these orders, the schools were regularly being warned of strict action for defying the direction.

He asked parents to directly lodge complaints on his email
