BAREILLY: Allaying concerns of residents over the novel coronavirus, district magistrate Nitish Kumar on Thursday said that the administration is well-equipped to tackle any such case and also set up a helpline — 05812553311, 9997164999 — for enquiries related to the disease. He added that shopkeepers who sell masks for exorbitant prices will be dealt with an iron fist. 


Addressing a press conference in the presence of doctors, the DM said, “There is no need to panic. Both the health department and private doctors have taken all measures to handle the situation. We have learnt that some shopkeepers are selling masks in the black market at high prices. Action will be taken against such people.” He added that isolation wards have been set up at the government hospital and all three private medical colleges in the district.

Warning people to avoid social gatherings to prevent the spread of the disease, Kumar said that there is no need to hoard masks, adding that even homemade ones are equally effective.

The DM said, “One should not pay heed to rumours or forward any message without verifying it. What we need to understand is that the fatality rate of coronavirus is only 2%. If anybody is suffering from cold, they should immediately contact the doctor and not start taking medicines without prescription.”
