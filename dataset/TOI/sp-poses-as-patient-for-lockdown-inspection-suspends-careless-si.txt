2020-04-02
RUDRAPUR: To check if lockdown guidelines were being strictly implemented in Udham Singh Nagar, district’s Superintendent of Police (SP) , City, posed as a patient to conduct a random inspection on Wednesday.


During the inspection, a sub inspector (SI) deputed at Uttarakhand-Uttar Pradesh (UP) border was suspended after he was found to be careless in abiding by the advisory issued in wake of Covid-19 outbreak. SP City Devendra Peecha, who carried out the inspection, told TOI, “I travelled to the UP border pretending to be a patient with a driver in a private car. On reaching there, SI Sanjeev Kumar stopped our car and asked us the reason behind our trip during lockdown. The driver responded saying that there is a patient in the car and subsequently, SI Kumar just let our car pass by. He didn’t ask us to show any medical records or even the car documents.” The official added such dereliction of duty can’t be ignored.

The incident was reported to Udham Singh Nagar’s senior superintendent of police Barinderjit Singh who ordered suspension of SI Kumar. Speaking to TOI, SSP Singh said that nobody is permitted to violate the guidelines issued by Union ministry of home affairs regarding Covid-19 pandemic. “SI Kumar displayed sheer negligence. If officers are not alert, then anyone can pass borders faking to be a patient. This may lead to chaos and disrupt law and order situation,” SSP Singh added.
