Responsibility of people to avoid crowded places: Gehlot

He said that the epidemic spread slowly first in China, Italy, Iran and the US before it started infecting a larger section of the population. In this regard, it is the responsibility of the people to avoid crowded places. Gehlot said that the government was sensitive to the issue and taking measures to prevent its spread in the state. People should go to public places only if it is necessary. He appealed to officials to issue guidelines for increasing the awareness of the people who should not fear the disease but remain alert. He said the situation was under control in the state so far and preventive measures were being taken.
