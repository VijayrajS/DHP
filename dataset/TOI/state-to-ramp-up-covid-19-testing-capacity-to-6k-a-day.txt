Gandhinagar: As the number of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat increases, the state government plans to greatly ramp up its daily testing capacity over the next two or three weeks.At present, the state government has a maximum testing capacity of 3,700 per day. As the pandemic situation worsens, the government is focusing on increasing testing capacity.A key source in the government said the testing capacity at all government colleges where Covid-19 tests are being conducted will be increased over the next fortnight or so. “At present, we have a testing capacity of about 3,700 tests per day, while we have been conducting between 2,500 and 2,700 tests per day across the state. If the need arises, the government will increase daily testing capacity at government colleges to about 6,000 a day,” the source said.The source said that the government is expecting that a few more private laboratories will also get Covid-19 testing permission. “Since the government of India has allowed asymptomatic patients to be isolated and treated at home, the government is exploring the option of more aggressive testing. By mid-May, testing capacity is likely to be about 6,000 persons per day,” the source said.So far around 56,000 Covid-19 tests have been done in the state, of which 3,774 returned positive. A total of 181 persons have died and 434 have recovered. More than 41,000 persons are under quarantine in the state. Ahmedabad alone accounts for more than 2,500 cases, followed by Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot.
