2020-04-01
MEERUT: A private medical college hospital in Meerut on Monday registered a criminal case against a man suspected to be suffering from novel coronavirus infection, alleging that he posted “misleading” videos on social media platforms to get a separate ward and early discharge.


In the video, the patient has alleged that poor quality food was being served to him in the quarantine ward.

The medical college authorities said that he was making misleading videos only to get discharged early and get a separate ward, which they said was not possible.

The videos show the suspected patient being served chapati and daal in a polythene bag. The patient also alleged that a coronavirus positive patient was accommodated with the suspected ones in the hospital.

Dr GP Singh, chief medical superintendent of Subharti Medical College said, “An FIR has been registered against the patient at Jani police station here for misleading people with incorrect claims and for hindering the work of the medical staff here.

He is a suspected patient and is being kept under 14-day quarantine. However, he has been asking for a special ward for him and his family. He has also been requesting for an early discharge, which is not possible according to the norms and hence he has adopted this measure.”
