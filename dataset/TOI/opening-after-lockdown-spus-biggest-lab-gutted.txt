VADODARA/ ANAND: A major fire broke out in a laboratory of Vallabh Vidyanagar-based Sardar Patel University (SPU) at Bakrol campus on Monday morning.

Though there was no loss of live or injuries, worth at least Rs 10 crore is feared as the entire facility was gutted. This laboratory of Department of Bioscience on Bakrol-Vadtal Road is the biggest of the university 

According to officials, the fire started at around 9.30am on Monday, when Ami Patel, a PhD student, opened the laboratory after two months of lockdown. All the laboratories and classrooms at the campus were closed since the third week of March.

Patel could sense the heat after opening the doors of the laboratory, but she ignored it assuming it to be trapped heat inside the locked up rooms. She turned on the electric supply and switched on fans and lights along with water purifier.

“It was then that she noticed an electric spark and sudden fire after which she called for help,” said SPU vice-chancellor professor Shirish Kulkarni.

Hearing Patel’s cries, non-teaching staff members immediately informed the fire brigade. But till then all major equipment, chemicals, computers, files, furniture among other items inside the laboratory caught fire while a gas cylinder also blasted.

“The fire brigade officials reached on time with nearly five fire fighting vehicles along with officials from the district administration,” said Kulkarni, adding that the fire has resulted in huge losses to the publicly-funded varsity. “The laboratory had all imported hi-end instruments and equipments that have been damaged because of the fire, which can be estimated to be around Rs 10 crore,” Kulkarni added.

It took nearly three hours for the firemen to douse the inferno, but smoke kept billowing out of the premises till much later.
