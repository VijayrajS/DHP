‘Lockdown has wiped out concept of time’
2020-04-10
Kolkata: Entrepreneur Kalyan Chaudhuri has virtually lost track of time as he remains confined to his home at an apartment complex in Behala with his wife Kakoli and son Saptarshi. 

An early riser and usually constantly on his toes to run his engineering business, Chaudhuri has now been finding it difficult to keep himself engaged. “I have subscribed to Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hoichoi and watch at least two movies a day. In the morning, I watch the news but with the Covid-19 graph in India refusing to hit a plateau, I turn it off, depressed,” said Chaudhuri. “I have now started feeding the strays. Also, being the treasurer of the apartment, I act as the conduit between the residents and the police. But yet, when I hit bed after midnight, I find it difficult to fall asleep.”

Chaudhuri usually has to travel a lot and often, finds it difficult to keep pace with time. “ Stuck at home, I prepared the payroll of my employees. We are a small firm, and the past three days, I have been receiving calls from my employees. They are naturally anxious, given there has been no production of late,” he said. “Even if we survive the novel coronavirus, are we ready for the economic challenge ahead?”

Chaudhuri’s son Saptarshi, who studies performing arts at Presidency University, looks forward to his 40-minute online class every day. “I am thankful for those 40 minutes, when I do something constructive. After the lesson, we have a lot of discussions, where we stick to academics. I have downloaded some classics. I am reading up on Charlie Chaplin. . As there is no question of stepping out, the terrace is now my only place of freedom. I watch films through the night and fall asleep early in the morning,” he said.
