2020-06-13
NEW DELHI: The daily count of Covid-19 in the capital crossed 2,000 for the first time on Friday with 2,137 people testing positive for the disease. With the highest single-day count, the total tally of the viral infection has reached 36,824 in Delhi. 


The number of deaths due to Covid-19 has mounted to 1,214. This includes 129 fatalities confirmed by the state’s death audit committee on Friday, of which 71 took place in the past 24 hours while 58 deaths occurred between May 9 and June 10.

After Maharashtra and Gujarat that have reported 3,717 and 1,416 Covid deaths, respectively, Delhi has witnessed the maximum number of deaths due to the disease.

More worryingly, the data shows 741 (61%) deaths have been reported in the national capital in the last 12 days, from June 1 to June 12. In March, April and May, Delhi reported 2, 57 and 414 Covid-19 fatalities, respectively.

The daily incidence of Covid-19 has also gone up significantly, with over 1,000 new cases being reported every day since May 28, except on June 1.

“The situation in Delhi is worrisome. If the infection continues to spread at this pace, the hospitals will fall short of beds and there will be a crisis situation soon. Lockdown or not, people should go out only if they must. They should take all possible precautions, for example wearing masks at all times and washing hands frequently,” said a senior doctor. 

Some of the residents welfare associations (RWAs), he added, are imposing lockdown measures in their own societies to protect residents. Many RWAs are also making their own isolation rooms and arranging oxygen cylinders for managing Covid-19 cases, in case the patients find it difficult to get a bed in a hospital when the pandemic is at its peak.

In a statement on Friday, health minister Satyendar Jain said that in view of the growing cases, Delhi government was making preparations on its part. He said, “Beds and ventilators will be increased. The central government has also told us that they will ensure full cooperation, so we will also seek their help. Their hospitals have a lot of ICU beds. There are around 13,000 beds in the central government hospitals, we would like to request the Centre to use those beds for Covid-19 treatment.”

Delhi government has also decided to utilise stadiums, banquet and community halls, and religious places such as dharamshalas to create more beds and run temporary hospitals.
