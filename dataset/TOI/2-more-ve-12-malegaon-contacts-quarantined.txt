Nashik: Two more individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 even as the throat swabs of 65 suspected patients, including the high-risk contacts of patients, have negative on Thursday, Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said.

“A 63-yr-old woman from Sanjeev Nagar, in Satpur-Ambad link road, and a 64-year-old man from Malegaon, who was admitted to a private hospital for angioplasty, have tested positive,” he said.

The throat swab samples of both the patients were sent to Armed Forces Medical College in Pune for testing.

According to officials, the man from Malegaon was admitted for angioplasty in a private hospital where already several beds have been reserved for Covid-19 treatment.

Doctors said all precautions to ensure that none of the other patients and doctors come in contact with the Covid-19 infected patient without proper precautions.

According to the officials, the woman, whose sons had come from Mumbai and Pune a few days back, was also admitted to a private hospital near the Ambad industrial area for three days. On April 13, the patient was shifted to the quarantine facility and her swab sample was taken.
