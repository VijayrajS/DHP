Lockdown leaves civilians in Kamptee cantonment short of essentials
2020-04-18
Nagpur: Civilian residents of Kamptee cantonment have complained that lockdown imposed by the army authorities had left them short of supplies.

For a population of 6000 civilians, the authorities are only allowing 2 vegetable vendors thrice a week for limited hours. Milk from cowherds within the cantonment was allowed to be taken out but there is no supply inside, says an email by Kamptee Cantonment Nagrik Mandal (KCNM) to district collector Ravindra Thakare and member of parliament from Ramtek Krupal Tumane.

Within the cantonment area, there are no facilities like ATM, medical shops or even grocery stores, the email says.

A week ago, the cantonment authorities had restricted entry ofvendors thrice a week— Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays— for three hours each during morning and evening. All roads to cantonment except one were blocked and trenches dug to prevent access. This also led to a section of residents taking a long detour to go in and out of the cantonment. The civilians live in The Mall and Gora Bazar areas of the cantonment.

“Things worsened on Friday. Despite movement being allowed on this day, there was virtual curfew in the area. Even milkmen were not allowed to enter. On the other hand, there were no restrictions on the army personnel,” said Premendra Wahie, the president of Nagrik Mandal.

Wahie said, “the two vehicles allowed for vegetables are a three-wheeler and a pick up vehicle The vegetable vendors could not enter as they were not issued cards. Milk is being allowed to be taken out for supplies to dairies, but it cannot be sold to civilians inside.” Dipendra Nath, a resident, said he was not allowed to go for even buying medicines for his child.

CEO cantonment board Abhijit Sanad said, “The issues raised by the civilians will be addressed in a meeting on Saturday.”
