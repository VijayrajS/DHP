NEW DELHI: The elderly, many of whom are also suffering from co-morbidities, now account for a larger share of deaths due to Covid-19. Around 75.3% of total fatalities are among people more than 60 years of age, whereas 83% deaths were in people with co-morbidities, government’s latest analysis shows.


The data shared by the government on April 6 (around two weeks ago) said 63% of 109 deaths were among those above 60 years age, whereas 86% of fatalities had conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease. 

On Saturday, the health ministry said 75.3% of 480 deaths were among those above 60.

Among deceased, 14.4% of people are in the 0-45 years age group, 10.3% in the 45 -60 years age group, 33.1% in the 60-75 years age group and 42.2% were above 75 years old, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.

“This brings to the fore the earlier highlighted facts that elderly people and people with co-morbidities are at higher risk,” he said.

The health ministry also said that there are a total of 755 dedicated hospitals and 1,389 dedicated healthcare centres in the country, taking the total dedicated facilities where severe or critical patients can be treated to 2,144.
