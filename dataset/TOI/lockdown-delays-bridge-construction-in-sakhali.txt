Lockdown delays bridge construction in Sakhali
2020-04-25
KERI: Covid-19 outbreak has affected the bridge construction work over river Valvonti linking Vitthalapur to Sakhali. People will be put to great inconvenience during the monsoon, if the construction work is not undertaken.


In February, chief minister Pramod Sawant had laid the foundation stone for the project to be constructed by the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) in 4 months.

Hitherto, people were using a wooden bridge to cross over either by walking or using bicycles, until the bridge was renovated and iron plates were installed in it besides embankments. From then onwards, the movement of 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers was restricted.

Though GSIDC had begun work of the new steel bridge, the remnants of the existing bridge are lying in the river bed. It will obstruct the flow of water and the situation will worsen in the rainy season.

Sandeep Chodnekar, general manager of GSIDC, told TOI, “For resumption of work, there is a need of skilled and trained work force. Presently, the entrusted workmen as well as the contractor are in Kerala. After May 3, we will try to remove the debris.”

Aanand Kanekar, councillor of Sakhali Municipal Council said, “We are aware of the problems and the chief minister has been informed. When the gates of anicut at Makadsheno will be removed, the water level in the river will get reduced drastically. It will help in removing the bridge remains.”
