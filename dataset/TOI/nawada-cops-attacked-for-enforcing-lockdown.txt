NAWADA: A group of miscreants attacked policemen when they asked people in a Nawada village not to assemble at one place in view of the nationwide lockdown. Four policemen, including the Rupoh police station SHO, were injured in the attack on Wednesday night. A named FIR was lodged against 40 persons.


The policemen had visited Mansagar Patori around 8pm and requested the villagers assembled at a place to stay indoors and follow the lockdown rules in view of the coronavirus threat.

“After patrolling in Pande Gangot, Fareda, Patori and other villages to convince people to stay at home, the police party reached Mansagar Patori around 8pm. Around 40 persons were sitting outside their houses in four to five groups. When we asked them to go back to their houses, they initially refused saying they did not believe in the PM’s appeal. But, later, they reluctantly obeyed,” Rupoh PS SHO Santosh Kumar said on Thursday.

“However, when the police party was moving out of the narrow bylanes, a crowd of around 200 people attacked us with stones and rods. Three constables, namely Bachcha Paswan, Ritesh Kumar and Gopal Singh, and myself got injured. Paswan’s skull was fractured and the Sadar hospital doctors referred him to Pawapuri Medical College and Hospital in neighbouring Nalanda district. The others were admitted to the Sadar hospital,” the SHO added.

He said Pakribarma SDPO Mukesh Sah visited the injured cops in the night.
