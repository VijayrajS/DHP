Police loosen grip as lockdown eased
2020-05-05
Trichy: As the lockdown was relaxed, police, who have been ensuring strict enforcement of the rule so far, had no other way but loosen the grip in the city and central region on Monday.

Police had arrested 4,199 violators and seized 7,452 vehicles in 2,013 cases and collected Rs 22.83 lakh fine from March 25to May 4. They had on an average arrested 100 people and seized 150 vehicles every day.

However, on Monday, police had a different approach towards people despite witnessing number of people riding their bikes and driving the cars. The reason: most commercial establishments resumed operation following the easing of norms by the state government.

Police who had tightened the grip on the people for roaming around the city without valid reason or on the pretext of buying essentials and medicines earlier had to allow most of them to do so because the people had reasons to argue with the police. On Monday, police arrested 20 people and seized 51 vehicles in 12 cases and imposed a fine of Rs 35,000 on the erring public.

“Vehicle checks would continue because the lockdown is in force,” commissioner of police of Trichy, V Varadaraju told TOI. In central region, police maintained the usual practice. On Monday, the central zone police arrested 1,075 people and seized 735 bikes and 17 four-wheelers. During the lockdown since March 25, police had arrested 82,711 people and seized 61,443 bikes and 1,338 four-wheelers.

“We are following the same approach checking the people. Since economic activities are happening, we are not preventing everybody as we are sticking to the rules,” said inspector general of police (IGP), central zone, A Amalraj.
