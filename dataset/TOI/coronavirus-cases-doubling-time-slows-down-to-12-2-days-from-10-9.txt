NEW DELHI: Even as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to increase, the doubling time has slowed to 12.2 days over the last three days from 10.9 days in the past 14 days, health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance and contact tracing in view of migrants and expats returning home.


In the last 24 hours, 3,604 new cases were added, taking the number of confirmed cases to 70,756. Of these, 22,455 people have been cured and 2,293 have died. Vardhan said the fatality rate was 3.2% while the recovery rate was progressively increasing and stood at 31.74%.

The doubling time had deteriorated last week after some states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and the national capital of Delhi reported significant increase in cases. On May 7, the health ministry had reported doubling rate of 10.2 days. Following the significant change in doubling time, the health ministry had deputed central teams to these areas to strengthen containment measures and assist state governments in controlling the spread of the disease.

Reviewing measures for management of Covid-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh with junior health minister Ashwini Choubey, Vardhan asked states and UTs to focus on surveillance, testing, contact tracing and timely treatment of all returnees. He suggested that the Aarogya Setu app be made compulsory for all returnees for better surveillance and suitable medical interventions, the ministry said. Vardhan also stressed on ramping up surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI), which will help in identifying hidden infections at an early stage.
