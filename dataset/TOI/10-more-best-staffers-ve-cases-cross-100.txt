MUMBAI: With 10 new cases, the total number of Covid-positive BEST staffers crossed 100 on Friday. Four of the 108 staffers are currently on oxygen support. This is the second time in two days that 10 staffers tested positive. On Wednesday, too, a similar number were found to be infected.

The cases have prompted BEST Workers’ Union to ask employees to “lock down” themselves from Monday. BEST though said it will take stringent measures to ensure all workers report for essential transport services. Shiv Sena union is with the management to avert shortage.
