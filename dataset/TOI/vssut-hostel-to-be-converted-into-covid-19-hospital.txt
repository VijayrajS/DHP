Sambalpur: In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, the health administration in Sambalpur district is converting a hostel of the Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology (VSSUT), Burla, into a Covid-19 hospital.

The additional district magistrate (Sambalpur), Suryanarayan Dash, said the Pulaha Hall of Residence of VSSUT will be converted into a 500-bed Covid-19 hospital. He said all equipment and facilities required for a Covid-19 hospital, will be available there.

Official sources said the civil work to convert the hostel into a hospital has started. A target has been set to ready the hospital in a month. The work is going on a war-footing. The doctors and para-medical staff of Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, will be engaged at the hospital to take care of the patients. 

Dean and principal of VIMSAR Brajamohan Mishra said the district administration is carrying out the work. The hospital will be handed over to us once the work gets over, he said.

Currently, the VIMSAR authorities have opened a Covid-19 counter out patient department (OPD) at VIMSAR. Around 80 to 100 patients are coming to the counter daily. Moreover, there are also two isolation wards with 30 beds at VIMSAR.

The state government has also planned to set up a Biosafety Levels 2 (BSL 2) laboratory at VIMSAR, Burla, where screening test for Covid-19 suspects can be conducted. The VIMSAR authorities have already sent a feasibility report to the state government for setting up of the laboratory.
