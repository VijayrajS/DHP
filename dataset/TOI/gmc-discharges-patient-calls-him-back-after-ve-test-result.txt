Goa: GMC discharges patient, calls him back after positive coronavirus test result
2020-03-27
PANAJI: Defying quarantine protocol and putting innumerable people at risk, the state-run Goa Medical College and hospital here allegedly discharged a Covid-19 suspect on Wednesday morning, only to summon him back later in the evening, after the man tested positive for the virus.


The patient in question was also put in quarantine three whole days after he arrived in the state, his family said.

During the intervening period, the 55-year-old man met several persons, including his family, who are all now in quarantine, while some people he met during the day are yet to be tracked down by health officials.

Protocol requires that a Covid -19 suspect is kept in quarantine, and not discharged from hospital until he tests negative for the virus-- but the tertiary care hospital has blundered in handling one of three cases that tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. 

The patient’s relative confirmed to TOI that the man, who returned to Goa from a foreign country on March 15, was not asked to be home quarantined immediately.

“The health department told him to be in quarantine on March 18 and he started feeling sick two days later, but prior to that - between March 15 and 18 - he was on the move to do some work. After four days in the hospital, on Wednesday morning, they (doctors) told him to go home saying, he was fine,” he said.

Surprisingly, the hospital didn’t think it prudent to send an ambulance to pick up the patient even after his status was known. “A relative of ours drove him to the hospital and he has been quarantined as well,” he said.

Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the information being circulated about the patient in question was not true and that GMC had not faulted. “I will check all the details and let you (TOI) know,” he said, when asked about the case. 

Six members of the patient’s household, including two children and a maid, have been quarantined in the sub district hospital, while his aged parents are home-quarantined.

The relative said since the news became viral, a lot of rumours have been spread about his family. “I want to state that except one member of our family, nobody has tested positive for Covid -19,” he said.

The patient’s relative also travelled to India from overseas on March 14, and he was also not asked to be in home quarantine immediately. “I got a call a day after my return, asking me not to go out,” he said. “They (health department staff) only called me over the phone asking how I was feeling, but nobody came to check on me physically, or to ensure that I was actually staying home.Nothing was explained to me even when they told me to be in home quarantine," he said.

He complained that the rooms in the hospital where he has been quarantined, along with other family members, were not clean and their maid (also in quarantine with them) had to clean them.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that 35 close contacts of the three patients who tested positive for the virus have been placed under isolation already.

“We are making all efforts to identify each and every person who has come in contact with the three patients, and keep them in isolation,” Sawant said.
