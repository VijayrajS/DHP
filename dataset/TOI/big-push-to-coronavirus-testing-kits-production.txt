Big push to coronavirus testing kits’ production
2020-04-03
Pune: Industrialist Adar Poonawalla has collaborated with Mylab Discovery Solutions to push up the production of testing kits required to rule out the Covid-19 infection. 

“It is my personal investment. It will help Mylab to scale up their production of Covid-19 testing kits from 1.5 lakh units per week to 20 lakh units per week and resolve the present crunch permanently,” Poonawalla, owner and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Serum Institute of India (SII), told TOI on Tuesday. 

Asked whether SII’s technical know-how will also be used in production of testing kits, Poonawalla said, “We won't be using any of SII’s technology. But our collaboration will help Mylab to supply their kits through the SII’s international network and base. Once India's shortage is taken care of, we will supply the kits to other countries as many are battling the shortage of these kits.” 

When probed on exact investment, Poonawalla said, “It is multi-million dollar investment which I am making in Mylab in a personal capacity. I cannot disclose the exact figures due to confidentiality. I naturally chose Mylab because it is the only ICMR accredited and commercially licensed testing kit manufacturing firm with the potential to scale up the production of kits into millions of units per week.”

Earlier, Mylab’s virologist and research and development chief Minal Dakhave Bhosale came in for much praise for having worked hard for developing the indigenous test kit. Bhosale delivered on a working test kit, just hours before delivering her baby girl. She is currently recuperating.
