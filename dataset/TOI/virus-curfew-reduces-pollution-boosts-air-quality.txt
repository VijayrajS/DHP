Closure of commercial establishments, industries, organisations and a reduction in vehicular load and construction activities is believed to be the reason behind the improved air. According to Central Pollution Control Board, the maximum improvement in pollution levels was recorded in Lucknow, with Air Quality Index (AQI) improving from ‘poor’ to ‘satisfactory’. 


The city’s AQI was 204 on March 24 (a day before lockdown) and dipped to 84 on Friday, witnessing a drop of 120 units. Industrial towns like Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Noida and Kanpur also breathed easy with pollution levels falling by 70-100 units in the past three days. Other UP cities such as Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Bulandshahr, which figured in the top five most polluted cities last year, also recorded their best air quality since post-monsoon 2019.

Kanpur, which attained global infamy in 2018 after WHO placed it as the most polluted city in the world, recorded ‘good’ air for the first time in the year with AQI of 50 on Thursday.

IITR director Alok Dhawan, “The lockdown has improved air quality as it has reduced vehicular load, construction activities and traffic snarls following the closure of commercial and industrial establishments. Rain in some parts of UP has further cleaned the air.”
