2020-03-24
PATNA: The state health department has increased number of beds in government hospitals across the state and asked district magistrates to identify hotels which could be used to quarantine coronavirus suspects.


While number of beds for coronavirus suspects in nine government medical college and hospitals has been increased to 100, all beds in district hospitals will be used for the purpose. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), which was running with just 20 beds for coronavirus suspects, has converted its 100-bed eye ward into isolation ward.

Even primary health centres (PHCs) have been asked to freeze all the beds, except five to six beds which will be used for pregnant women, state health department additional secretary Kaushal Kishore said.

Five private medical college and hospitals have also been asked to set aside 20 to 50 beds for coronavirus suspects.

There are 534 PHCs in Bihar each having 18 to 30 beds and 36 district hospitals with 80 to 100 beds. Roughly, around 45,000 beds have now been separated in government hospitals in the state for coronavirus suspects.

“As of now, we do not have shortage of beds in government hospitals. However, we have to be ready to meet any eventuality in future,” said a government hospital doctor.

The health department is also planning to increase the number quarantine centres. Apart from Patliputra Ashoka Hotel in Patna with 200 beds which is being used as quarantine centre, eight additional hotels have been identified in the state capital for the purpose. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said Ashoka Atithi Niwas in the town would be converted into a quarantine centre with 48 beds. Two hotels in Gaya with 52 beds have also been earmarked for the purpose.
