Vadodara: A coronavirus patient in Chhota Udepur was booked at Bodeli police station for travelling to Surat in his car to pick up his wife and mother from his uncle’s house during lockdown.

Mohsin Khatri, who was third person in Chhota Udepur to test positive for coronavirus, had not come in contact with the first two patients. He told health officials that he had not travelled anywhere. 

However, police investigation and his call detail records revealed that he had travelled to Mora Bhagal locality in Rander area of Surat on March 29 to his uncle’s house to pick his mother, wife and sister-in-law and their children. 

By then Rander had been declared a red zone due to increase in number of cases there.

After waiting there for an hour, Khatri started for Bodeli. On the way, he dropped his sister-in-law and her daughters at Palej and continued towards Bodeli. 

Around 11 days later, when Khatri’s mother’s health was not fine, he took her to a private hospital in Bodeli from where he was referred to community health centre. 

At the health centre, Khatri too complained that he had cold and fever so the mother-son duo was sent to Chhota Udepur general hospital where their samples were collected for coronavirus test.

On April 11, while Khatri’s mother turned out to be negative, Khatri’s report came positive.

Police said he violated public notification by travelling to Surat’s red zone area during lockdown and affected his elder brother and his wife too. 

“As of now, he is undergoing treatment at the hospital and hence we have not arrested him,” said a police official.
