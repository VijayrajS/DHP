KRISHNAGIRI/DHARMAPURI: As a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri district administrations have ordered closure of cinema theatres, shopping malls and commercial establishments, including marriage hall, for 15 days until March 31. People are also instructed to avoid crowding in temples on auspicious days.


Besides ordering the closure of 22 cinema theatres in Krishnagiri district, collector S Prabhakar also ordered all the government and private schools to be closed until further notice. “Cinema theatre owners were instructed to reopen the theatres based on the situation prevailing in the district,” he said.
