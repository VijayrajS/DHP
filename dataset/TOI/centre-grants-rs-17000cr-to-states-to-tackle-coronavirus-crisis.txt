NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday released Rs 17,287 crore to different states to augment their financial resources to combat the coronavirus crisis. 

While the home ministry approved an advance release of Rs 11,092 crore to all states under the State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF), in line with the assurance given by PM Narendra Modi to CMs on Thursday, the finance ministry said Rs 6,195 crore was transferred on account of “revenue deficit grants”, which were part of the 15th Finance Commission recommendations for 14 states, including Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. 

“The Centre released in advance its share of first instalment of SDRMF for the year 2020-21, amounting to Rs 11,092 crore, with a view to augment funds available with the state governments,” the home ministry said in a release.

To make available additional funds to the states for taking preventive and mitigation measures for containment of Covid-19, the Centre on March 14 had made a special dispensation for utilisation of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

This fund was allowed to be utilised for setting up quarantine facilities, sample collection and screening; setting up additional testing laboratories, cost of consumables; purchase of personal protection equipment for healthcare, municipal, police and fire authorities; purchase of thermal scanners, ventilators, air purifiers, and consumables for government hospitals.
