Docs, nurses get latest updates on Covid-19
2020-03-12
Coimbatore: An awareness session for healthcare professionals on the latest updates on Covid-19 was conducted by the Indian Medical Association’s Coimbatore chapter in the city on Wednesday. 

More than 450 healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, from government medical colleges, the state health department and private hospitals attended the programme. They were taught the basics of the diagnosis of the disease and which patients they should refer for testing and treatment protocols in place.

The programme focused on self-prevention, checking the spread of the infection, diagnosis and treatment. “Since health professionals have to work close with patients, they were told the ways to protect themselves, including wearing masks and washing or sanitizing their hands before and after examining patients,” IMA state secretary Dr A K Ravikumar said. “Patients showing symptoms like fever, cold and cough with a recent travel history from abroad or fever with body pain is the main criteria for testing for the virus,” he added.

Reminding the professionals that anti-viral drugs for the virus are yet to be found, the programme pointed out that treatment is symptomatic for the disease. “If the patient is at the risk of developing pneumonia or some lung infections, we should treat them accordingly. They can be given oxygen support or ventilator if required,” said Ravikumar. Doctors have also decided to display the 104 helpline number prominently in all hospitals, for patients to contact if they suspect they were infected with the virus. tnn
