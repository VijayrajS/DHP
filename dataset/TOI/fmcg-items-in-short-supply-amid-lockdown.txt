2020-05-19
PUNE: Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) are in short supply in the city with a 30-70% shortage at grocery stores the lockdown was extended till the month end. 


Most retailers said packaged food items such as noodles, some brands of biscuits and tea, pasta, salty snacks or ‘namkeen’, toothpaste and ready-to-eat products are either unavailable or in short supply at grocery stores, as glitches in supply are affecting the stocks. 

The retailers said the distributors, at the end of the manufacturers, have refused to deliver goods to them. 

Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retail Traders’ Association, said, “Only those retailers have all the products can go to the distributorships to collect all the items. Distributors or super stockists attached to multinational companies are no longer offering deliveries to retailers.”

He told TOI, “This has been going on since the lockdown. The distributors have been claiming that they are either short staffed or do not have vehicles to transport the goods. The retailers often have to stand for 4 hours in a queue to get all the goods from distributorships, which too is on a first-come, first-served basis.”
