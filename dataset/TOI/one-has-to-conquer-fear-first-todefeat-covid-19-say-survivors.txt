One has to conquer fear first to defeat Covid-19, say survivors

JAIPUR: There is more fear about the disease than what it is in reality, says the first cured Covid-19 patient, who belongs to Rajasthan.

While the virus is affecting the lives of people, 85-year-old Madhusudan (name changed) is lucky and has survived despite having co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease and diabetes.

He has just recovered from the disease. His family was also fortunate as no one got infecteed. “We were in disbelief when this happened to us,” Madhusudan’s son told TOI, while recalling the day when doctors asked the family to distance themselves from him for some days. The 10-odd days in isolation will always remain etched on Madhusudan’s mind. Even while he was suffering painfully, he could not hug and embrace his children.

His family knew that it was a tough time as the entire country had started facing the highly contagious epidemic. “We were aware that if we got worried or lost hope, we would be heading nowhere. Family members gave strength to each other and we defeated fear from our minds. From the entire episode, I can say that as long as you are taking all medicines, precautions and following guidelines issued by the Centre and the state government , there is no need to worry,” said Madhusudan’s son.
