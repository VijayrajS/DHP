KOLHAPUR: Solapur district on Saturday reported its first death related to Covid-19.


Solapur district collector Milind Shambharkar on Sunday said that the man was a resident of Pacha Peth area of the city. He was admitted to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Sarvopchar Rugnalaya (civil hospital) on Friday after he had reported difficulty in breathing.

"We have cordoned off the area and have identified 52 close contacts of the deceased. They all have been admitted to the civil hospital and their throat swab samples have been collected for testing," Shambharkar said.

He added that the area where the deceased used to live has been declared containment zone and all the movement has been restricted for the citizens. 

"We have started a disinfection drive in the area. The one-km area is sealed and further guidelines for the residents will be announced soon," he said.

According to Shambharkar, the administration is taking care of everything and there is no need to panic.

"A team of policemen and civic officials has been appointed in the said area and all necessary containment zone precautions are being taken," he said.

Earlier, the Solapur district administration had sounded an alert last week, when the first case of a Covid-19 was traced in the South Solapur taluka. The male patient was working as worker in a village and had gone to Gwalior after the outbreak of Covid-19. 

Shambarkar said, "The worker tested positive in Gwalior and the administration there alerted us."
