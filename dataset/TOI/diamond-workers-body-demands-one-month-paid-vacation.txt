In a memorandum submitted to the district collector, GDWU office-bearers stated that the diamond workers are vulnerable to the virus as the diamond units, especially the small and medium units, are not taking any sort of health and safety measures to protect the workers. Like the schools and colleges, the government should declare paid vacation for the workers in the diamond industry as well. 

President of GDWU, Ranmal Jilariya told TOI, “At least four diamond workers sit on the diamond emery wheel to cut and polish the diamonds at the distance of two feet. Majority of the small and medium units are yet to take health safety measures like keeping the sanitisers and providing them with masks.”

Jilariya added, “The industry will have to face serious consequence if the coronavirus disease would enter the diamond markets. Already, the workers are underpaid as the diamond units have reduced work. However, it is in the benefit of the government and the industry to announce paid vacation for the workers in the industry.”
