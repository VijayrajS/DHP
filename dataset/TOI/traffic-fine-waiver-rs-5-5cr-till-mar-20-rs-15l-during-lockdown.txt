Traffic fine waiver: Rs 5.5cr till Mar 20, Rs 15L during lockdown
2020-04-01
Kolkata: The one-time traffic fine waiver scheme launched by Kolkata Police from March 1 has got off to a flying start. In the first week, Rs 1.5-crore fine was collected and 2.7 lakh cases were disposed after 37,000 vehicle owners responded to the scheme. The response got even better when sergeants started collecting fines on the road. Till March 20, total collection of fines reached over Rs 5.5 crore. 

Ever since the lockdown was imposed, the collection of fines, however, reduced to a trickle. Total amount collected on March 31 is a little more than Rs 15 lakh, though online collection is still active. Senior traffic department officials said that the deadline for the fine collection is likely to be extended beyond March 31. 

Police sources said the lockdown affected the popular scheme in two ways: physical absence of vehicles on road, which means police had little option of pursuing anyone, particularly commercial vehicles like buses and taxis. Secondly, cops have been busy with the enforcement of lockdown and other duties associated with keeping the Covid-19 menace at bay. 

“We expect that the scheme will continue, but we will have to take a decision based on ground realities. We might reintroduce the scheme once things get normal,” said the police officer. The joint CP (Traffic) Santosh Pandey said that the traffic department’s priority goes to Covid-19 and the scheme has not been suspended for a single day as “it can be settled online.” The last round of waivers — one that ran for 75 days — had yielded around Rs 40 crore, compared to the paltry Rs 6 crore in a 30-day period this time.
