Vadodara: The 65-year-old woman, who died while being treated as a suspected COVID-19 patient in SSG Hospital on Sunday, has tested negative for Coronavirus. This was confirmed by state health commissioner Jaiprakash Shivhare. However, samples of a 50-year-old man who died later in the day, are awaited. 

Neither of the two had any travel history.

According to hospital authorities, the woman who was already critical and admitted in the isolation ward died at around 10.30 pm on Saturday night. “The woman had no travel history and had co-morbid conditions including diabetes, hypertension, respiratory illness and obesity. She had shunted to two or three private hospitals, was already on ventilator before she was admitted at our hospital,” said Dr Rajeev Daveshwar, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital.

The male patient was already admitted in the hospital but was shifted to the isolation ward because of new guidelines issued by the government that all those who have serious chest infections should also be treated as COVID-19 suspects.

The female was a resident of Manjalpur area while the male hailed from Dabhoi, sources said. The Dabhoi native too did not have any foreign travel history nor had he travelled outside Vadodara in the recent past.

By Sunday night, Vadodara city and district had three confirmed COVID-19 positive patient while reports of seven others, who are being treated as suspects, are awaited. Of the seven, six are currently admitted at SSG’s isolation ward which on Sunday screened 100 fresh individuals.

“There are presently 442 individuals in Vadodara who are under quarantine,” said Dr Uday Tilawat, chief district health officer.

The three positive cases which are undergoing treatment include a patient who has travel history of Spain and two others who have travel history of Sri Lanka.
