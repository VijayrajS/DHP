Behera, a professor of pulmonary medicine, said the group would meet very soon. “We are in the process of quick information gathering. We will discuss how the disease is behaving in different ways in different countries, what is causing death and how to evolve the clinical practice that is needed for India,” Behera told TOI. 

There will also be more focused approach towards hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which many consider as a potential drug for Covid-19. Even though a clinical randomisation trial may not be possible given the urgency, efforts will be made to scientifically find out how HCQ is working, he said.
