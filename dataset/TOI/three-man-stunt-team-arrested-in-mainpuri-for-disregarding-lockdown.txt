Agra: Amid novel coronavirus panic, Mainpuri police arrested three people on Monday night under the Epidemic Diseases Act, for allegedly organising a stunt show in Nagla Madari village, Kishni, during the lockdown.According to police, the suspects, Laxman Singh, Krishna Gupta and Lallu, were arrested by police for violating prohibitory orders to organise a gathering of over 100 people for the display of stunts on bicycles without requisite permission. They were also using a sound system to attract crowds, despite imposition of Section 144 across the district, said police. The trio was well aware of the Covid-19 scare and had also maintained the Janata Curfew on March 22.

You people are putting your lives at risk,” said a policeman, warning citizens to stay at home, saying strict action will be taken against them otherwise. Police also recovered two bicycles, weights, sound system, along with some cash from their possession.Talking to TOI, Kishni police station in-charge, Omhari Vajpayee, said they were booked under Section 3 (penalty for disobeying any regulation or order) of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Section 188 of IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).
