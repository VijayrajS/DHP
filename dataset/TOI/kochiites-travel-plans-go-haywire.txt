Kochiites' travel plans go haywire in the wake of coronavirus outbreak
2020-03-05
KOCHI: More than 75% of Kochiites with bookings for a holiday abroad with family have cancelled their travel plans in the wake of the Covid-19 cases. There are nearly 18,000 to 20,000 advance bookings from Ernakulam district alone. 


Of the total travel by Kochiites abroad, more than 50% is for leisure during April and May. The most popular destinations are East Asian countries, Dubai and Europe.

"We are witnessing large-scale cancellation of group tours. However, some are still willing to travel to places where Covid-19 cases have not been detected. On Thursday, a group of 50 persons will leave for Dubai," said Praveen Shetty of New Prime India Cochin Tours and Travels.

Malayalis mostly opt for advance bookings for summer vacations and plan their trip by December or January. They stand to lose money as airlines and hotels are refusing full refunds. "The only exception is China," said Shetty.

Incidentally, the most affected would be those who had planned their trips on their own. They stand to lose everything they paid for hotels as well as airfare. Those opting for group tours with a travel agency may lose only about 50% to 60% of advance paid, if airlines refuse to reimburse in full.

Travel agents must bear the brunt as they have made advance payments for blocking airline seats and hotel rooms. They block about 20 to 30 seats in airlines to popular destinations for the summer months.

With most airlines refusing to reimburse money for cancellations, tour operators have sought the assistance of Union tourism ministry. "Airlines claim that since they operate flights to most destinations, they are not legally bound to reimburse for cancellations," said Rashmi Murali, managing partner, Yatri Travels.
