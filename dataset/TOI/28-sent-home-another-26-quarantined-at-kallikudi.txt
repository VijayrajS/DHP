Trichy: After sending 28 quarantined air passengers for home quarantine, the public health and preventive medicine department in Trichy has accommodated 26 passengers including two women at the makeshift Covid-19 quarantine facility at the central vegetables, fruits and flowers market in Kallikudi. 

Out of the 426 passengers who landed at the international airport on four flights from Sharjah, Dubai and Singapore, health department officials separated 24 men and two women based on their travel history (to countries most affected by Covid-19) or comorbidity or age — above 60 years. All of them were brought to the central vegetable market by 108 ambulances in the early hours of Friday. They have been made to stay in the shops that were furnished with cots and beds. 

“If they show no symptoms of Covid-19, they will be sent home with an advice for self-quarantine for 14 days,” deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr A Subramani said. The 28 passengers already sent home late Thursday night after a day of quarantine had not shown any symptoms. On being sent home, the passengers have been asked to follow a healthy diet for sometime. Subramani said the passengers have been advised not to have non-vegetarian food for time being. “We are asking them to take millet and easily digestible food to keep them fit and immunized in order to protect themselves from infection,” he said. 

Seven passengers with symptoms of Covid-19 were still kept under observation at the isolation ward in Trichy on Friday as the results of their swab test were awaited from the viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) at the government medical college hospital in Tiruvarur. Issuing strict warning against rumour mongers, Trichy collector S Sivarasu said such action will attract penal action from the law enforcers.
