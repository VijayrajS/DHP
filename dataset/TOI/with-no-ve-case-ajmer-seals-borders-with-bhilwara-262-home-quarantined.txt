Ajmer: In the wake of Bhilwara emerging with high numbers of coronavirus positive cases, Ajmer police sealed the borders with Bhilwara on Friday.Police is keeping 24-hour watch on the borders. Though there are 262 people in quarantine in the district, residents fear that if any infected person from Bhilwara enters the city and comes in contact with others, then there can be a major outbreak in the city too.So far, Ajmer has not reported any case of coronavirus. Over 50 patients were tested, but negative. SP Kunwar Rashtradeep said the borders adjoining Bhilwara have been totally sealed and police is checking every vehicle moving close to the border. Ajmer is just 60km away from Bhilwara city. “Both roads from Bhilwara are completely blocked and no one is allowed to enter the district,” said an official. Even the adjoining Kekri border is sealed. But there are villages like Nagelao, Kadera and Kairut from where people can enter into the city. District chief medical and health officer K K Soni said there are 262 people in Ajmer city who are quarantined, including people from Bhilwara. However, there might be over 600 such people. “The major problem is that no one informs about such people coming from Bhilwara and that is a lapse in security measures,” said Soni. He added that they are appealing everyone that they should inform about such people so that the health department can quarantine them in their houses for the next 15 days. The health department initiated a survey and also deputed teachers to check that people who are quarantined don’t leave their houses. Ajmer police is on heels and checking every unnecessary movement on road.
