Bijnor: Desperate times call for desperate measures. With nationwide lockdown in progress, a groom–to-be decided to go ahead with his wedding minus “band, baja and baraat”. Instead of the horse that grooms traditionally ride on, he chose to drive his motorcycle to the bride’s house. His baraat comprised his father and two friends to witness the wedding. After getting married, he returned home with his bride without any fanfare. The wedding took place in Bijnor's Jatan mohalla under Bijnor city police station area on Thursday. Vikas Kumar, 22, from Naseerpur village under Kotwali Dehat police station area, was in high spirits ever since his marriage was fixed 18 months ago. He expected a big fat wedding but the outbreak of coronavirus put paid to his plans.With the entire country locked down and people asked to maintain social distance and stay indoors, a grand wedding was out of question.Not willing to put off his wedding, Vikas invited his closest friends and headed for the bride’s house along with his father and two friends on two bikes. Donning the groom’s outfit, Vikas also wore the protective mask before heading for the bride’s house.Later, Vikas told TOI, “I have some plans to make my wedding memorable. But I had to content with a small family function. Most of my friends missed my wedding because of coronavirus and restrictions on movement and gatherings.”The wedding rituals were performed in the presence of close family members. The bride’s neighbours also kept away from the wedding.
