No event in Ayodhya till lockdown: Temple trust
2020-04-21
LUCKNOW: Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has decided not to organise any meeting or event in Ayodhya till the lockdown is lifted.


“I don’t think there will be any religious leader or entity in the world to opt for any activity at the cost of the lives of believers. If someone does so, it is the individual to be held responsible and not the community as a whole. We are not in favour of organising any event in Ayodhya till the lockdown is lifted,” Ram temple trust general secretary and VHP international vice-president Champat Rai said. 

The statement is being seen as an indication that the construction of Ram temple will begin only after the lockdown ends.

Rai said the trust will not flout the lockdown rule. “There is no way forward but to wait and watch,” he said, adding that the trust will not act irresponsibly like the Tablighi Jamaat in fulfilling its religious goals at the cost of country and lives of scores of people.

VHP sources said the trust will decide another date and time for starting the Ram temple construction by convening a meeting in Ayodhya after the lockdown ends. Sources said the trust had also decided to stop the work of stone carving at Ram Janmabhoomi Karyashala until the lockdown is lifted and normalcy returns. It is only after that the trust would call a meeting of its executive body and accordingly decide the future course of action.
