Punjab’s unsung Covid-19 warriors: Hoshiarpur women home-make masks for villagers
2020-04-22
CHANDIGARH: In a Punjab village, women stitch masks at home to protect fellow residents, 2,000 outside workers, and food distributors from Covid-19 infection.

Good with stitching, these young women of Gugwaal Haar in Hoshiarpur district’s Hajipur block started the initiative on April 6, based on production guidelines from the office of the Union government’s principal scientific adviser.

Punjab principal secretary for science and technology Alok Shekhar said: “The women found the backing of the sarpanch first and then the Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST) based in Chandigarh.” This department of science and technology (DST) programme for the technical empowerment of women also produces energy from rural biomass in Hoshiarpur’s Talwara block.


 


DST secretary Ashutosh Sharma said: “The crowd sourcing of home-made masks for the general population is fast catching up with public awareness about the making and use of this protection. If local leadership continues to support us, it will slow down and break the chain of virus transmission.”

The science council provides the group with raw material. Within the first 10 days, the women supplied more than 2,000 good-quality masks to four nearby villages, for labour, villagers, and small shopkeepers. Council’s member secretary Jatinder Arora said: “The women work on our grassroots projects for years. We gave them mask-making manual in the local language.”

The PSCST has also created a WhatsApp group for sarpanches, local SHGs (self-help groups), women, and farmers of 30-odd villages of Talwara block. The members follow advisories of the state’s and central governments.
