2020-05-09
Nagpur: Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court directed the Amravati Municipal Corporation (AMC) and other authorities to explore implementing Bhilwara pattern in the district to contain the growth of coronavirus cases. It also asked the government to forward AMC’s proposal for 10,000 rapid antibody testing kits to ICMR which was told to complete the formalities at the earliest.The directives came after a suggestion by petitioner Shivaray Kulkarni’s counsel Pankaj Navlani, who pressed for stringent measures to control the growth of deadly virus in Amravati.According to him, if such pro-active measures could be implemented in Bhilwara with positive results, there is no reason why same could not be implemented in Amravati.“While this court would be extremely slow and cautious in treading on the territory and domain of executive policy, it would be appropriate if the suggestion is seriously considered either way,” Justice Rohit Deo said while directing the respondents to file an affidavit in this regard before May 15.Earlier, AMC lawyer Gemini Kasat informed that it had sent a communication to Akola-based deputy director of health for 10,000 rapid antibody testing kits.Navlani pointed out that the police machinery was not enforcing the lockdown with an iron hand. Quoting the collector, he added that city police had been extremely lax in imposing fines and in taking recourse to legally permissible measures. Denying this, government pleader Sumant Deopujari clarified the police were proactively working.“Considering the statement by the Amravati police commissioner, no specific directions are required at this stage. However, this court hopes and trusts the assurance given by him shall be fulfilled in letter and spirit and every lockdown violator shall be sternly dealt with within the four-corners of law,” Justice Deo said.
