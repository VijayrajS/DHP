2020-03-11
PUNE: Collector Naval Kishore Ram on Tuesday issued a strict advisory against any kind of gathering, while warning of legal action against those flouting these norms. 


The advisory came after the count of novel coronavirus patients climbed to five in the city on Tuesday evening, from just two a day before.

The collector urged citizens to refrain from attending any kind of event or even going to cinema halls for any screening. While there is no closure of cinema halls or movie screenings, as done in Kerala, he said people should exercise caution. “It (cinema hall) is a place which can be avoided for a few days,’’ he said, adding, “My team will be reaching out to those holding events. If they do not adhere to the stringent advisory, legal action will follow.” 

On school closure, he said strict guidelines would be issued if required. “We will take decision after consulting the government,’’ he said.

The collector said five squads had been formed to gather information about the contacts of the coronavirus positive patients. “The squads will verify if contacts of the patients are showing any symptoms of Covid-19. They will also keep a track of places the patients visited,” he said.

Appealing to all the doctors of the district through the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the collector said the doctors should keep the information of all the patients who are coming to India from foreign lands, separately.

Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said a video-conferencing with the chief minister and others was expected on Wednesday. 

Till March 10, a total of 1,29,448 passengers have been screened at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports. According to the Union government’s new notification, passengers arriving from all over the world are being inspected at these three airports in the state.
