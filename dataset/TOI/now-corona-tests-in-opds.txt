Kolkata: Now, coronavirus tests in OPDs
2020-05-27
KOLKATA: Not all patients taking Covid-19 test will be required to take admission. Private hospitals that have Covid-testing facilities, will now be allowed to test at OPDs. The health department came up with a circular on Tuesday, allowing private hospitals to collect samples and test on walk-in basis. 


Doctors said this testing strategy was much needed keeping in mind the evolving norms on who to test and also relaxed norms on certain categories of positive patients, who can be at home isolation. 

“This new norm is a much welcome strategy. This will be beneficial at least in two ways, cutting the cost of the patient’s hospital and also allowing the government to increase the number of tests,” said gynaecologist Basab Mukherjee, vice president FOGSI (Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India). 

The test should, however, be done only after doctor’s advise. The circular says sample of the intending patient should be taken in the collection unit of the hospital, following protocols, including social-distancing and infection-control measures. 

“This is a much-needed strategy. It will be of much help for patients undergoing a planned surgery. While it saves bed charges, those beds could be free for other patients,” said Dr Sudipta Mitra, CEO Peerless Hospital.
