Singer Kanika Kapoor, who was discharged from hospital earlier this week after being treated for Coronavirus, will now be questioned by the Lucknow Police following the FIR lodged against her by Chief Medical Officer (CMO), UP, for negligence. 
Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Narendra Kumar Agarwal, had filed an FIR against the Baby Doll singer on March 21 at the Sarojini Nagar Police Station under Sections 188 (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant), 269 (negligently acting in a way likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), and 270 (malignant act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.
The singer had tested positive for COVID-19 on March 20 and had subsequently been hospitalised in Lucknow. Kanika had come to Lucknow on March 11 after she reached India two days earlier from London and had attended several social gatherings before testing positive for the disease. 
According to the Lucknow Police, the questioning will take place after Kanika completes her 14-day quarantine period post being discharged from the hospital. Speaking to us a senior police official of the Lucknow Police said, “We are as of now focused on the lockdown. Once this is over we will be questioning Kanika Kapoor. It is part of SOP or routine practice followed after an FIR has been lodged. It will be done within three months of the complaint being filed.”
