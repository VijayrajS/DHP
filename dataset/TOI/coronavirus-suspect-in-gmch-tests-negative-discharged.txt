Nagpur: A 41-year-old IT professional from Nagpur, who had travelled in a flight from Dubai, has tested negative on Friday evening. He was seated next to the Hyderabad youth who tested positive of COVID-19. The city man had been admitted in the quarantine ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), on Thursday. He was discharged late on Friday night.

Medical superintendent of GMCH Dr Avinash Gawande informed that the tests were conducted in the new facility installed at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH).

“The patient had travelled on February 20 from Dubai to Bengaluru and then to Nagpur. The patient did not show any sign and symptom of cough, cold and fever, but he informed that he was seated next to the Hyderabad youth. So, we took no chance and admitted him to the quarantine ward,” Dr Gawande said.
