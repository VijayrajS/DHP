The order, issued by state chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh, said, “Only employees who are deemed to be necessary for carrying out work in office are required to be present.” The order does not apply to those employees who handle essential services like health, sanitation, police, transport, civil supplies, power, and drinking water, said a government official.

The order further adds that all the employees availing ‘work from home’ facility should be available on phone and must be ready to come to office, if called, to carry out work when required.

“World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic and experts from across the world are urging to practice social distancing to combat coronavirus outbreak. Thus, the government is taking all necessary steps to contain the virus from spreading in the state,” said the government order.

Meanwhile, state health secretary Pankaj Pandey also issued an advisory on Wednesday for private companies and offices in Uttarakhand directing them to offer ‘work from home’ options to their employees and implement ‘work in shifts' systems so that only limited number of staff remains at office at a time. Besides, employees suffering from cough, cold or fever should be given leaves on priority by their employers, according to the advisory issued by the health secretary.
