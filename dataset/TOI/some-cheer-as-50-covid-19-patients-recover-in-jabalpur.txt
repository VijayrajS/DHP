2020-05-17
JABALPUR: As more than 50% of Covid-19 patients of Jabalpur have already recovered — the district administration will not increase restrictions, but instead ensure status quo in the containment zones of the city.


Talking to TOI, Jabalpur collector Bharat Yadav said, “We are dividing the city into several zones, and in zones where there are no active cases, there may be some relaxations. But in containment zones, things will remain the same. However, no new restrictions will be imposed.”

So far in Jabalpur district, test reports of 4,447 people have been received. Of them, 175 people tested positive, but 95 of these 175 have already recovered and there are only 72 active cases. 

In a press statement, Yadav said that there are 17 containment areas in Jabalpur and vigil is being kept in all those areas. Strict action would be taken if anyone is found violating norms, he said. Appealing to those who are coming to Jabalpur from outside, he said that they should ensure that they remain in home quarantine for 14 days. 

The administration is working to ensure that these people are provided employment through various schemes such as the MNREGA, the district collector said. 

The collector also appealed to various volunteer organisations in the district to assist migrant workers who are returning to the district through various means.
