TRICHY: Following a communique from the railway board to engage medical practitioners at railway hospitals on a contract basis to handle the situation following the outbreak of Covid-19, authorities of the Ponmalai railway hospital in Trichy are working on the process of identifying retired medical practitioners and paramedical staff to tie up with them.


In order to control and effectively contain the pandemic, health officials from the respective railway divisions have been asked to engage retired doctors at railway hospitals for a period of one month over and above the vacancy as per local requirement.

Divisional railway health departments have been asked to follow the engagement process as already laid down by the board. They have also been instructed to give first preference to retired railway doctors who are below 65 years. To meet the shortage of doctors in railway hospitals, engaging contract medical practitioners against regular vacancies has commenced.

A senior official from Trichy railway hospital said that seven to 10 vacancies may have to be required to fill including paramedical staff at the Ponmalai Railway workshop hospital. They have begun the process of preparing a list and would soon engage the required number of doctors as well as paramedical staff, the officer said. 

Meanwhile, the railway board has instructed its divisional health officials to allow all central government servants to avail services from railway hospitals by producing their identity cards at the health units, an official from the Trichy division said.
