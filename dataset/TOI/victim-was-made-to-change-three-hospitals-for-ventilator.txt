2020-03-27
BENGALURU: The death of a 70-year-old Covid-19 infected woman has raised questions about the city's preparedness, especially with regard to ventilators.

In less than 48 hours, she was shifted to three different hospitals: the district hospital in Chikkaballapur, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases in Bengaluru and then to Bowring & Lady Curzon hospital, all for a ventilator. She died Tuesday midnight and three medical staff at Bowring hospital who treated her are now in home isolation. It’s the first Covid-19 death in Bengaluru.

Sources privy to the case said, “There are not enough ventilators in the city, and the health community is worried. There is no clarity about what led to her death. Was it late diagnosis or shortage of ventilators? She developed acute respiratory distress. The woman’s son, who has also been quarantined, expressed his helplessness at having to take her from one hospital to another,” sources said.

K Sudhakar, medical education minister and in-charge of Covid-19 matters, said she was shifted from RGICD as all beds there were occupied.

Currently, there are not more than 2000 ventilators in the state and half are in Bengaluru. RGICD director Dr C Nagaraja was unavailable for comment about ventilators.
