2020-03-27
MUMBAI: Two 65-year-old women in Mumbai, both without any apparent travel history, have succumbed to Covid-19, taking the state’s death toll to five. On Thursday, eight patients tested positive from the state, three from Sangli and one each from Mumbai, Sindhudurg, Nagpur, Kolhapur and Pune. Maharashtra now has 130 cases but was overtaken by Kerala (137) on Thursday as the state with the most cases.


One of the two women who died was a Govandi resident, the other was from central Mumbai. The death of the Govandi woman has triggered a frantic contact tracing mission as she had visited at least three hospitals before succumbing. Her positive test reports arrived after her family had carried out her final rites. As per WHO, a stringent protocol has to be followed to cremate an infected person which involves carrying the person’s remains in a leakproof body bag and minimal contact with others.

 
 


Exercise on to trace dead women’s contacts

The second woman who died was reportedly a food (dabba) vendor who catered to clients working in nearby corporate offices. Soon after she was admitted to Kasturba on March 23, civic officials began a contact tracing exercise and reached out to a dozen people. The woman was a known case of diabetes and hypertension and had complained of breathlessness at the time of admission to Kasturba. While civic officials confirmed her death, they didn’t comment on how she could have got the infection. “Leave alone international, she has not done domestic travel,” said a civic official. Seven people from her family are believed to be under home quarantine.

The Govandi woman’s reports came positive while she was admitted at NMMC hospital in Vashi on Wednesday. NMMC medical health officer Dr Balasaheb Sonawane said, “The woman was suffering breathlessness and her kin took her to Tandon hospital in Chembur late on Tuesday. At 1.30am on Wednesday, doctors at Tandon referred her to Kasturba as she was symptomatic. But instead her kin took her to Dr DY Patil hospital. There too, doctors referred her to the civic hospital in Vashi. But by the time she reached here, she was critical and succumbed on Wednesday evening. But we had sent her swab sample to Kasturba and the report came positive on Thursday morning. But her kin had already taken away her body on Wednesday for cremation.” NMMC has served DY Patil hospital a show-cause notice for referring a patient without protocol.

Sonawane said, “The Tandon hospital administration should have informed BMC’s health department about the patient being symptomatic instead of directly sending her to Kasturba. We have the mobile number of the woman’s family member, probably her daughter, but calls are not being received. We need to trace her family members to quarantine them. During lockdown, she might have been brought in an ambulance from Tandon hospital to Nerul. So even the ambulance driver will have to be quarantined. We are coordinating with BMC officials to trace the family.”

In Mumbai, two doctors have tested positive in the last few days. While it’s unclear how one of the doctors contracted it, the other had come in contact with an individual who had returned from Italy. Two more patients were discharged from Mumbai on Thursday. In all, ten in the city have been discharged.

Of the other cases, the patient from Sindudhurg was in contact with a person who tested positive and they had travelled together in a train. The person from Nagpur has a travel history to Delhi, and it is not yet clear if he has a travel history abroad. The three in Sangli who tested positive are part of 12 members of a family that have tested positive.
