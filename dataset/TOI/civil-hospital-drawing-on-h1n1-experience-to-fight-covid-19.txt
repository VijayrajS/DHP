Nashik: The management of the Nashik Civil Hospital is in a much better position to handle the Covid-19 pandemic than it was during the 2009 swine flu outbreak.The experience that the hospital management had in dealing with swine flu cases is now helping it deal with the new pandemic. The hospital is also much better equipped as the state government has upgraded the medical infrastructure since the swine flu outbreak.“The experience that the doctors and the para-medical personnel gained in handling swine flu patients is helping us now. Many of those doctors and para medicos are still with us. And they have trained the ones who joined hospital later,” said Nashik civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale.When the swine flu broke out, the civil hospital initially had 7-8 beds. “Over the years, we increased the number as our staff became trained to handle more patients. Now, even without any confirmed coronavirus case, we have already established a 15-bed isolation ward. We have another 15 beds in reserve,” he said.The only difference is that there was a prescribed medicine — Tamiflu — for swine flu patients. “But in the case of Covid-19, the doctors have to treat the patients based on symptoms. There is ample stock of such medicines with us,” he added.The civil hospital has three physicians and one pulmonologist at its disposal. “There are several pulmonologists in private hospitals. We can always fall back on them if need be,” the civil surgeon said. However, the hospital has requested the state government for a more physicians and pulmonologists.“The immunity among Indians is better. The spread of this virus is manageable. To start with, refrain from touching surfaces and then your nose or mouth. This eradicates 90% chances of catching this infection,” he said.
