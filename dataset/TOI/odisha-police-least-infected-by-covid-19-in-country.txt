2020-06-04
Bhubaneswar: Odisha Police have fared well in protecting its force from the wave of Covid-19 pandemic, according to a finding by the Indian Police Foundation (IPF), a key independent think tank on policing and law enforcement in the country. 

The IPF has released a comprehensive data on the nationwide impact of the novel coronavirus on police forces, including the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF). 

While most of the states have Covid-19 positive cases in double digits in their police forces, Odisha has only one positive case in the police department, the data revealed. Significantly, the lone positive cop, who is a constable with commissionerate police in Bhubaneswar, has recovered and been discharged from hospital. 

The IPF data said 31 police personnel in the state have so far been quarantined following their deployment in containment zones and for coming in direct or indirect contact with positive and suspected positive patients. Four cops in the state were injured after being attacked by miscreants during the enforcement of the Covid-19 regulations. 

The IPF said altogether 5,791 personnel from the police forces and CAPF in the country have so far been infected with Covid-19. Maharashtra topped with 2,509 positive cases and 27 deaths in their police force. So far, Chhattisgarh has reported 549 positive cases, Delhi 520 positive cases, Tamil Nadu 320 positive cases and West Bengal 164 positive cases in their police forces. 

“The rising numbers of Covid-19 infections and related deaths in police/CAPF is deeply worrying. While social distancing is not always possible, the personnel should be alert to the dangers of proximate interactions & should ensure strict hand hygiene & wearing of masks,” tweeted the IPF.

The Odisha Police officials said they took a slew of measures to keep the force free from Covid-19.
