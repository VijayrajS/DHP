Pilibhit: As many as 15 Nepalese labourers, who were on their way home from Agra on foot, were caught in Pilibhit — after covering over 270 kilometres — in the early hours on Saturday and quarantined.

After a police team from Sungarhi police station caught the labourers near Assam road outpost at 3am, they were quarantined in Agrawal Sabha Bhawan in the city by the health department.

As Agra has, so far, reported nearly 200 novel coronavirus positive cases, Pilibhit health department officials have kept the Nepalese labourers under tight vigil at the quarantine centre.

According to station house officer (SHO) of the Sungarhi police station Atar Singh, all the 15 labourers hail from Nepal’s Kanchanpur district, close to the Indo-Nepal border. “They were working in hotels and had left Agra on April 12 on the foot for their homes,” he added.
