The footfall at malls and restaurants has also taken a hit. Representatives from Phoenix Marketcity stated that the number of people coming to the mall has dropped drastically. “Many people are coming in as they want to purchase groceries and essentials. People want to stock up on important items in case the situation worsens,” the representative said. 

 
 
Chief operating officer of Amanora Mall Surjit Singh Rajpurohit said, “There has been a huge reduction in footfall at the mall as well as at the restaurants in the mall. This is true for Amanora Mall and other establishments too.”

The mall has taken several precautions to ensure that people feel safe. “Hand sanitizers have been places at all possible locations. We are cleaning the railings and other high contact spots at regular intervals. Also, we have tied up with a hospital for screening people entering the mall, just like at airports,” he explained.

Like malls, restaurants in the city are also experiencing a reduced footfall. A representative from FC Road Social told TOI, “The crowd has been reducing over the last 2-3 days due to the coronavirus scare. We got a smaller number of bookings for Saturday night as compared to what we generally get on weekends.”

Kunal Udane, owner of German Bakery, said, “There has been a drastic reduction in the number of customers over the last few days. We are, however, taking all precautions to ensure that walk-in customers or delivery orders are proper. We are screening our staff and we have provided them with masks. Sanitizers have been provided at all spots. Meanwhile, across restaurants in the city, we are witnessing an increase in delivery orders.”
