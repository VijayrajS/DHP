Midnapore: A 45-year-old woman who died after a heart attack in a Bengaluru hospital had to be buried in a forest near her home in West Midnapore’s Kalaikunda on Monday after her family faced resistance at two burning ghats over unfounded suspicions of Covid-19 infection.

Homemaker Mira Mahato was taken to Bengaluru for treatment on March 19 after doctors in Midnapore failed to make her better, her daughter Rina (28) said. 

“My mother was a cardiac patient. She passed away on Saturday afternoon (around 1.40pm) and doctors there mentioned cardiac arrest in her death certificate.” 

Mira’s body was brought in an ambulance to their village home in Kalaikunda’s Hariyatara. “Locals prevented us from cremating my mother in the crematorium adjoining our village. They said since she had died in Bengaluru, they feared she might have died of Corona virus,” Rina said. “We tried to reason with them and showed the death certificate. But they wouldn’t listen.”

The family then took Mira’s body to Midnapore town’s Padmavati crematorium. “There too we faced similar resistance,” Rina said.

After residents informed police, the family was told to bring the ambulance carrying the body to Kotwali police station. “Police checked my mother’s death certtificate and asked us to take the body back to Kalaikunda. We sought police help and took my mother’s body to Poradiha forest nearby where we buried her,” Rina said.

According to a senior police officer, “people were scared of the Corona virus though the deceased did not die of the disease”. “We took measures to ensure peace but also helped the family bury the body,” the officer added.
