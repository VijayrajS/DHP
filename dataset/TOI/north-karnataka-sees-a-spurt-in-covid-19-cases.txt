North Karnataka sees a spurt in Covid-19 cases
2020-05-28
HUBBALLI: Covid-19 cases are increasing rapidly in North Karnataka after the return of migrated labourers from other states, mainly from Maharashtra. 

The number of cases in Davanagere and Yadgir districts, which were categorised as green zone till April, have already crossed 140. While Kalaburagi has crossed 180, Belagavi is just a few numbers short of 150. Bidar has crossed the 100 mark. 

Vijayapura, Bagalkot, and Raichur have already registered over 70 cases and Dharwad, Ballari Gadag are fast approaching 50.

On Wednesday, Kalaburagi reported 28 cases, Yadgir 16, Bidar 13, and Belagavi 4. The spike in cases day after day has left the local people worried. The magnitude of migrant workers returning to their native places in North Karnataka and Kalyana Karnataka has also brought to fore the failure of successive governments in creating employment opportunities for the local people to prevent migration. Labourers from Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Bidar, and Raichur usually migrate to Maharasthra in search of work. Now the families of labourers are in fear of being jobless till the situation returns to normalcy for another six months, said Amaranth Patil, president, Hyderabad-Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Kalaburagi.

“The government should lease out 2,000 acres of land available in the region to industrialists to start industries by offering concession and other facilities to prevent migration of labourers to other states and to provide dignified life to them in their native towns,” he said.

Dr Raghavan, district surveillance officer, Davanagere, said, “We have stepped up measures to contain the spread of the virus in the district. We are strictly testing the samples of people in all 14 containment areas in the district.”
