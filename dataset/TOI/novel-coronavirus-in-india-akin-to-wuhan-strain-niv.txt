Novel coronavirus in India akin to Wuhan strain: NIV
2020-02-12
PUNE: Scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) on Tuesday said the novel coronavirus in India was similar to the one reported from Wuhan, without any major mutations.


The conclusion was made after sequencing the whole genome of the new strain from the samples of two of the three Wuhan-returned medical students who tested positive for the contagion between January 31 and February 3. 


 
Sequencing the genome of the virus was key for diagnostic markers and identification of potential preventive vaccine options, experts said, adding that the genome of an organism contained its hereditary data encoded in its DNA.

“After mapping the whole genome, we have found that the novel coronavirus is similar to the one reported from Wuhan. There are no major mutations between them,” senior scientist RR Gangakhedkar, chief of the epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research, told TOI.

Asked if the virus was likely to undergo major mutations in the near future, Gangakhedkar said, “The viruses are unpredictable as they keep on evolving. Hence, it is difficult and premature to conclusively say anything now.”

The Pune-based NIV has tested over 600 samples for novel coronavirus infection so far. But can NIV handle the increased load if need arises? When asked, Gangakhedkar said, “Yes, NIV can ramp up the capacity, if need be, to testing over 700 samples per day.”

On infected patients showing no symptoms of the contagion, he said, “It is true that sub-clinical infection poses challenge to prevent and control any infection. However, strategies to screen the close contacts and their isolation at household level can be useful.”

Asked about the best and worst case scenarios, he said, “It would be difficult to describe these scenarios as there are more unknown issues than known in nCoV outbreak.”
