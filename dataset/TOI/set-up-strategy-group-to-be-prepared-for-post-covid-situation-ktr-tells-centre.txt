2020-04-29
HYDERABAD: IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao has urged the Centre to set up a national-level strategy group to study impact of Covid-19 on information technology (IT) and small-scale industries. Many countries have already set up strategy groups with industrialists, intellectuals and industry experts to deal with the situation after lockdown is eased. It should be replicated here, he added.


KTR participated in a video conference held by Union minister for electronics, IT and communications Ravi Shankar Prasad with all states IT ministers on Tuesday. Seeking two electronic manufacturing clusters for Telangana, he said the existing two clusters were now full. He said MSMEs in IT and electronics should be bailed out from the crisis by extending GST and income-tax concessions to them.

Explaining the flip side of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Telangana IT minister said the crisis would open more opportunities to the country. He said many countries like Japan have announced that they would shift their manufacturing units from China in the wake of the coronavirus situation. “There is a need to evolve a strategy to bring the manufacturing units to India that are willing to relocate outside China. This will give employment opportunities to the people in the country,” KTR added. 

 The government should provide support for Bharat Net project, the minister said. As per the 2018-19 fiscal, the IT industry in Hyderabad had 5,43,033 employees working in 1,500 companies with annual exports to the tune of Rs 1,09,219 crore.

He said a Telangana-based startup has developed a Covid-19 test kit, which was also approved by ICMR. Also, two or three startups were working on PPEs, gloves, and goggles, he added.
