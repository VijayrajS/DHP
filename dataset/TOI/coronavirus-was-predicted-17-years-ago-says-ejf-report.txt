Coronavirus was predicted 17 years ago, says EJF report

Nagpur: A 2003 report by the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) had predicted the Covid-19 pandemic 17 years ago. The report was commissioned after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to review zoonotic viruses, which transmit from animals to humans.Executive director of EJF Steve Trent told TOI, “We are at last beginning to understand that wildlife trade and rampant exploitation of the natural world is not just a danger to the overall ecological security of the planet but to human health — to ourselves.”Trent said, “It’s the intermixing of multiple species that occurs in the wildlife trade — species that don’t normally mix closely in the wild — that likely forms the pool for virus transmission, possibly with mutations from one species to another.”He adds, “Ebola, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Rift Valley Fever (RVF), SARS, West Nile Virus (WNV) and Zika Virus, all these made the jump from animals to humans, and it was almost always human behaviour that caused the leap.”The NGO has re-published the report commissioned in 2003 in the wake of Covid-19, to highlight the warnings that were missed and has called on world leaders to ban sale of wildlife in markets.The report had warned that China was the most likely candidate for the next novel zoonotic virus and called for a reduction in consumption of wildlife, along with strengthening of China’s animal protection laws.The report, authored by Dr Lynn Dicks of the University of Cambridge, identified 76 viruses that have transmitted directly between animals and humans without an arthropod vector, such as ticks. It found that 52 represented serious public health concerns and 36 were found in Asia.Reviewing the factors that contribute to the likelihood of a new virus emerging, the report found that China was especially at risk. Key reasons for this included widespread consumption of wildlife and rapid ecological degradation such as deforestation.“The risk of another previously unknown viral disease emerging in China as a result of direct contact between people and wildlife species is substantial,” the report said.The report was reviewed by well-known experts Robin Weiss (professor of viral oncology, University College London), Wolfgang Preiser (professor of medical virology, University of Stellenbosch) and Malcolm Bennett (professor of veterinary pathology, University of Liverpool).Dr Dicks and these experts said in a statement, “It is important to note that the report was written 17 years ago. We publish it now only to highlight that we had all the knowledge we needed to curb dangerous practices and lower the risks of tragic pandemics such as the one we are living through in 2020, but we didn’t. Now we are scrambling to sequence the virus, develop tests, drugs and conduct trials within a few weeks.”They said, “Translation of knowledge into policies is seriously lacking. We are not even prepared when it comes to the very basics of protective equipment for front-line medical staff. Nor did we heed the lessons of SARS in 2003. Instead ‘business as usual’ continued.”“We’re not expecting another coronavirus to develop in the next few months or even year. But we should expect it in decades to come, unless bans on the wildlife trade are put in place in China and other consuming countries. And it’s crucial that those bans be enforced,” he said.Trent added, “The wildlife trade plays a key role in the transmission of these diseases. It brings multiple species, many of which may not interact in the wild, into close contact with each other, so that diseases may jump between species and furthermore, into direct contact with humans so that these diseases may be transmitted to us.”“Not only is this trade, as we now clearly know, a damning threat to human health and our global economy, it is also emptying our natural spaces of the wildlife that sustain them,” Trent says“We knew enough 17 years ago to take action – millions of lives are being lost because we failed to heed that warning. We cannot let this happen again. Now is the time to close the wildlife markets and end this trade for good,” the report says.KEY RECOMMENDATIONS* Reduce hunting and consumption of wildlife, particularly primates, wild pigs and rodents* Post health warnings in restaurants and wildlife markets, warning consumers and traders about the risk of contracting novel diseases from wild animals and their raw meat* Encourage research to survey potentially zoonotic viruses in mammals * Encourage long-term research to monitor wild rodent populations and the link with predator populations, to establish whether excessive hunting is causing an indirect risk of disease transfer by leading to high rodent densities
