2020-05-28
NASHIK: The e-payment system of paying fines for violation of traffic rules, which was introduced a long time ago in the state, is helping the police personnel in the city in times of coronavirus pandemic as they donâ€™t have deal with cash or come in close contact with motorists.


Police imposed fines of Rs 26.72 lakh from March 25, when the nationwide lockdown had started, till May 24 and told the violators to make e-payment.

Police have, however, received only 4.84 lakh of the fine amount while the remaining Rs 21.87 lakh is still pending. 

City police commissioner Vishwas Nangare Patil said that there are instructions from higher-ups in Mumbai that fine should be collected mainly through the e-payment mode. The police personnel have been given devices with the help of which they can issue e-challans and also collect fine.

Police said that the record of motorists who have not paid the fine would always remain with police. Even if such a motorist goes to another part of the state and violates a traffic rule, police there will immediately know that he/she has not paid the previous fine.
