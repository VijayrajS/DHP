Srikakulam: Srikakulam district registered three Covid-19 positive cases on Saturday, the first three in the district, said district collector J Nivas. All three cases were reported from Pathapatnam mandal, close to the Odisha border.

The collector said that a lockdown would be enforced in 18 villages under Pathapatnam mandal. Villages around Kakawada, Seethe and Koravawada have been marked out as containment zone and will be provided with vegetabbles, medicines, drinking water and other essential items through doorstep delivery. Animal feed will also be provided. 

Speaking on the positive cases, the collector said the three patients are family members of a man who returned from Delhi. He was tested on Thursday and his results returned positive. Later, the samples were sent to Kakinada for a final test and the test results were negative.

“The man did not have any links with the Delhi Markaz,” said Nivas, but three of his family members tested positive.

The collector said that the man had come in contact with 29 people. Around 211 people who had returned from Delhi after March 20 have been placed in home quarantine. Altogether, 13,500 people from Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of the country have been put in home isolation, Nivas said.

Nivas asked people who have returned from Delhi, Mumbai and other places outside the district to remain at home. A control room has been set up for each mandal, he said, and officers and staff of revenue, medical, panchayati raj and rural water supply departments will remain available.
