After Kerala, K’taka too may opt for ‘reverse quarantine’
2020-06-08
BENGALURU: With Unlock 1.0 kicking in and the number of Covid-19 positive cases witnessing a spike, the Karnataka government is likely to implement ‘reverse quarantine’ to protect elderly citizens and others susceptible to coronavirus.

Reverse quarantine, implemented by Kerala, refers to the system of isolating two vulnerable sections — those who are more than 60 years old or with underlying medical conditions — from the rest of the population that resumes work in the new-normal situation. The emphasis will be on protecting these sections from getting infected by putting them in separate rooms and limiting their interactions with other family members, who move out of the house every day for work.

Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan told TOI: “Our priority is to protect the vulnerable, especially elderly citizens and those with co-morbidities. We have been brainstorming reverse quarantine and have been seeking opinions from experts.”

The response has been mixed. Dr US Vishal Rao, part of Covid Consultative Group (an independent think-tank), has suggested the government roll out reverse quarantine wherever possible. “The Covid-19 experience in Karnataka suggests that while younger population is vulnerable to the virus, the elderly population is prone to fatalities,” he said.
