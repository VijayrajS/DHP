2020-04-26
HYDERABAD: A UVC-based disinfection trolley to fight Covid-19 pandemic has been developed by the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials is association with University of Hyderabad (UoH) and Mekins Industries Ltd. (MIL).

The trolley can be used for rapid cleaning of the hospital environment and railway coaches. UV light in the range of wavelengths between 200 nm and 300 nm is capable of inactivating microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses.

The UVC disinfection trolley consists of 6 UVC germicidal tubes, which are arranged to illuminate three sides with two tubes facing each direction. Floor disinfection is done by two smaller UV lights located at the bottom. The hospital rooms get disinfected when the trolley is moved around by an operator in a protective suit and UV resistant goggles.

“Dry disinfection and sterilization of hospital rooms, instruments and other surfaces in the high-risk areas using a deep ultraviolet light is a good solution, which is implemented by the designer trolley in a compelling package that brings in ease, speed and efficiency,” said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary of DST.

The trolley has been deployed at Employee’s State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) hospital in Hyderabad for field trials. On average, the UVC trolley system with an average speed of 5ft/min can cover a room of 400 sqft within 30 minutes for complete (>99%) disinfection.
