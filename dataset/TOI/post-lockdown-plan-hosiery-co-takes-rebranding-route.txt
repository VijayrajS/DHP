Post-lockdown plan: Hosiery co takes rebranding route
2020-05-29
Kolkata: At a time when the hosiery segment has been worst hit by the lockdown, Dollar Industries, a leading brand with 15% market share, is opting for re-branding to tone up their business strategy in line with the changing taste of present day consumers. 

This was for the fourth time after 2010 that the 48-year-old company has decided to go for re-branding their products and unveiled a new logo. 

In keeping with the demand from young buyers and competition in the hosiery segment, the company is now venturing into the launch of more youth-friendly products. Though the company had floated the idea of rebranding earlier, they unveiled the new logo in the fourth phase of the lockdown, ensuring that work on the new line of their business strategy could kick-start once the business chains — manufacturing to marketing — start picking up the pieces. 

Vinod Kumar Gupta, MD of the company, said, “The new logo symbolises our product line. The Covid-19-induced lockdown has brought our industry to a halt. Transportation of raw cotton to spinning mills from Gujarat and Maharashtra has been affected. The industry is plagued with shortage of manpower as labourers went back home. We are waiting for the industry to gather momentum soon.”
