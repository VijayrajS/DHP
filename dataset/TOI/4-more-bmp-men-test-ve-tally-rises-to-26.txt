PATNA: With four more Bihar Military Police (BMP)-14 personnel testing positive for coronavirus on Saturday, the number of cases on the BMP campus at Khajpura has increased to 26. The campus has headquarters of fifth, tenth and fourteenth battalions of BMP.

A woman constable from BMP-1, 24 serving and a retired havildar of BMP-14 have been tested positive for Covid-19 since May 7. The woman constable, also a cook for a woman IPS officer, had returned from leave and quarantined on the campus. 

A senior IPS officer said contact tracing of the four new positive cases would be done to identify more cases.

“The daily sanitization process on the campus was supposed to end on Saturday. However, fresh positive cases mean that the exercise will continue for at least one more week,” he said.

Another IPS officer said the BMP-5 and BMP-10 personnel have so far not contracted the virus. “Samples of 12 BMP-5 personnel were collected as they had come in touch with a BMP-14 jawan. Their results, however, came negative,” he said, adding 10 BMP-10 personnel were also tested negative for Covid-19.

State nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Ragini Mishra said it was still not clear how the virus reached the BMP campus. “The retired BMP havildar, the first from the BMP campus to contract the virus, was quizzed. However, nothing concrete can be said about the origin of the virus on the campus,” she added.

Meanwhile, four more police personnel tested Covid-19 positive from the Nawada district police lines on Saturday.
