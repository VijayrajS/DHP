Seek feedback on lockdown woes: PM to RJs
2020-03-29
NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday praised the role of radio jockeys in spreading awareness about Covid-19 and urged them to spread not only views of experts and steps taken by the government but take feedback from people about the difficulties faced by them during lockdown so that these can be resolved. 

In a video conference with RJs, Modi appreciated them for discharging their responsibility and recording programmes from home during the ongoing 21-day lockdown.

He said RJs are like members of families of millions of Indian households and people not only hear but also follow them. RJs have a great responsibility not just to disseminate information but also motivate people, he said. 

He exhorted the RJs to disseminate positive stories and case studies, particularly of those patients who have fully recovered from coronavirus infection, thus bringing the entire country together.
