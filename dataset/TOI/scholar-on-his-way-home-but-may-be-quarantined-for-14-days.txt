KOLKATA: Hours before he was to take the special Air India flight back to India, Wuhan University researcher Samya Ray on Friday said he would feel “safe” only after he returned to his East Burdwan home. Ray, along with others from Wuhan who were returning on Friday, have been asked for their explicit consent to be quarantined for a fortnight, possibly in Delhi, before they return home. 


Another flight, sources said, is being arranged in a few days for those who are stuck in the Hubei province.

“I hope I have not been affected. It has been nine days and I am feeling fine. I have remained inside my home all this while,” he said, waiting at the pick-up point with five others headed to the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. “I do not know about those from the other universities who will be travelling with us, but we do have a closed social media group of all students and researchers in Wuhan University and have been sharing information. Till now, none have complained of any fever-like symptoms. But we are taking all precautionary measures,” he said. 

Ray added that since there had been a lockdown in Wuhan, the chances of the disease spreading have somewhat been controlled. Over the past three days, Ray said, the Indian Embassy has been in regular contact with them. “They have been helpful and cooperative,” he said, adding that the embassy has asked them to individually file consent forms which specified that, given the situation, they would be quarantined and kept under observation for 14 days before being allowed to return home. 

“So even if we reach India, it will be a while before we can go home. I will only feel safe when that happens. The anxiety and tension are palpable out here,” he said. Ray said he and the others have been asked to carry drinking water on the journey and the embassy has assured them of making arrangements for food.
