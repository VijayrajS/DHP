Study: Uneven Covid-19 testing across country
2020-04-25
HYDERABAD: A study done by Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) researchers has revealed that tests conducted across India for Covid-19 are highly uneven and reflect a disproportionate screening drill, as far as population density is concerned. 


The researchers of TISS’ School of Public Policy and Governance said West Bengal with a higher population density of 1,029 persons per a square kilometre has low testing rates. Whereas, Rajasthan with a density of only 201 persons per sq km has a tpm of 516.

TISS alumnus — TS Pranathi and Shruthi Prasad — and faculty professor Aseem Prakash in the study ‘Navigating to normal a responsive lockdown exit strategy’ urged states to strengthen the testing capacities to cover more extensive sections of populations. 

“Private players should be incentivised by government to provide affordable testing. Robust data collection of disease can strengthen and streamline Covid-19 testing protocols,” they observed.

TISS experts said vigorous testing mechanisms have to be put in place due to the growing apprehensions about community transmission as well as rising cases of asymptomatic individuals testing positive.

“Considering the possibility of a spike in infections despite an extended lockdown, a flexible approach is suggested to a phased exit. Moderate or strict restrictions can be activated or removed in an adaptive manner, depending on evidence of infection rates and institutional preparedness,” the study recommended.
