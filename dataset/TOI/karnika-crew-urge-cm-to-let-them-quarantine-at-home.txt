Goa: Karnika crew urge CM to let them quarantine at home
2020-04-29
PANAJI: The 93 Goans working as crew on board the ship Karnika have written to chief minister Pramod Sawant requesting that they be placed under home quarantine and not the mandatory 14-day institutional quarantine upon their return to Goa.

The crew said that they’ve been under self-imposed quarantine on board the vessel for 42 days, and that they cannot afford to pay the daily quarantine charge of Rs 3,000. They said that most of them haven’t completed their contracts, and thus they haven’t got their expected wages. They also said that they’re mostly the sole earning member of the family, and that they have no other income. Stating that they have aging parents and little children waiting for them, they asked Sawant to let them reach home without the mandatory quarantine. “We assure you that as a precautionary measure, we will be under home quarantine,” they said.

A follow-up to their April 11 letter, they added that the cruise ship’s last operational trip was on March 1, when she left Mumbai and reached Dubai on March 5. The ship arrived in Mumbai on March 12 with only crew. “Upon arrival at Mumbai port, all crew members were medically cleared by the seaport public health office,” they stated. They added that the ship’s owners took the ship to outer anchorage as a self-imposed quarantine, which ended on March 26. Only those who were residing in and around Mumbai — 133 seafarers — were allowed to disembark on March 31.
