2020-04-13
CHENNAI: As Tamil Nadu's Covid-19 positive count crossed 1,000 on Sunday, the government decided to test anyone showing flu-like symptoms for the virus. If state laboratories are overloaded, samples will be sent to private labs to reduce turnaround time and the government would foot the bill, said health secretary Beela Rajesh. 

The toll in the state rose to 11 with a 45-year-old woman dying of the viral infection in Chennai, while 106 more people tested positive, taking the total to 1,075.

The revised protocol will allow testing not just for those with contract/travel history, but for anyone with cough, fever or breathlessness. The state will also continue to screen patients admitted to hospitals with severe acute respiratory illness.

The state now draws at least 2,000 samples every day for testing. It has so far tested 10,655 samples in 14 labs in government sector and nine in private sector, the health secretary said. "We have about 24,000 RNA-based PCR testing kits in stock and we will soon be getting 90,000 more kits. We are using them to do all the testing without waiting for the rapid testing kits to arrive," Beela Rajesh said. 

Among those who tested positive on Sunday, 16 had travel history and 90 had contact history, she said, without elaborating on the number of people from the Tablighi Jamaat cluster. Two patients were among the 49 people admitted to various hospitals with severe acute respiratory illness. Both had contact history, she said.

The 45-year-old woman who died in Chennai was undergoing treatment at Omandurar Multispeciality Hospital in Chennai since April 5, three days after her 53-year-old husband, a participant of the three-day.

Six people have been discharged taking the total number of people discharged so far to 50, the health secretary said. The state has launched IVRS facility to help patients identify their risk. People can dial 949-991-2345 to find out if they are low or high risk.
