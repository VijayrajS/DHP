PUNE: There are no active Covid-19 cases in 10 out of 13 municipal councils in the district, stated a report of Pune Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer Ayush Prasad.


Daund with 24 cases, and Vadgaon Maval and Jejuri with one each, are the exceptions. All the 24 cases in Daund are related to the SRPF jawans, who tested positive after returning from a 45-day stint in Mumbai.

The Baramati municipal council area had earlier reported seven coronavirus cases. Six have recovered. One succumbed to the disease. The civic council areas of Bhor, Indapur, Junnar, Alandi, Lonavla, Chakan, Saswad, Shirur and Rajgurunagar have not recorded any Covid-19 positive cases so far.

Eight of the 13 talukas covering the rural parts of the district have 34 active Covid-19 cases. Of them, 21 are in Haveli taluka and three each in Shirur, Velha and Bhor.

A total of 72 Covid-19 positive cases were found in the 13 talukas. Prasad told TOI, “Most areas in Haveli taluka are semi-urban and closer to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation areas, where coronavirus has shown its presence in a big way.”
