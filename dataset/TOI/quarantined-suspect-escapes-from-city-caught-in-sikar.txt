JAIPUR: A corona suspect, who fled from Jaipur’s RUHS Hospital around 4am on Thursday, was caught on the way near his hometown Sikar by a team of district administration and health department officials late in the night. He was brought back to RUHS in an ambulance and quarantined under security. 


When the suspect landed here from Dubai, health department teams conducted his screening. Suspecting him a case of Covid-19, they sent him to RUHS hospital for quarantine. 

Soon after he went missing, nearby districts were alerted and his location was tracked. A team under Sikar chief medical health officer De Ajay Chaudhary was formed which included Sikar district administration officials. They came to know that he had reached district hospital’s trauma centre.

He was roaming without a mask. “We immediately provided him mask and called an ambulance and sent him back to RUHS for quarantine under security,” said Dr Choudhary.

Dr Chaudhary said since he belonged to Sikar, they were aware that he would reach there. They have also taken his relatives under confidence and provided counselling to persuade them for quarantine for some days. 

“He reached from Dubai and he was a suspected Covid-19 case. His relatives informed us about his location and we reached the place and provided him counselling to persuade him to spend some days in quarantine facility at RUHS,” said Dr Chaudhary.
