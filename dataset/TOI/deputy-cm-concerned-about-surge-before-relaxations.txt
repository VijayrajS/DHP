2020-05-31
PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city was a concern before the lockdown relaxations to be implemented after June 1.

He told the administrative officials in a review meeting on Friday that considering the rising cases in Pune, there would be area-specific relaxations. The lockdown rules would be strictly implemented in the containment areas, stated officials.

The state government is expected to issue fresh directives after the Union ministry of home affairs on Saturday announced extension of the lockdown till June 30. The district administration would issue orders based on them. Specific guidelines would have to be issued for Pune, said a senior official. tnn
