DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old Covid-19 positive patient died at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh on Sunday. This is the third death of Covid-19 positive patient at the facility. 

The AIIMS-R administration has said that the victim died of electric shock. Reportedly, the victim was electrocuted in April this year. Later, he was operated on, treated and discharged from the facility in the first week of May.

Professor UB Mishra, dean (administration) AIIMS, said that the patient had sustained severe burn injuries in the elbow and had suffered perforation. “We had to remove those parts of his body that were totally burnt as he was electrocuted by a high-tension wire. He was treated and discharged from AIIMS-R in May first week but he returned to our OPD with breathing issues. Subsequently, we collected his sample and he was tested Covid-19 positive on May 29. He died today due to excessive electric shock,” added Mishra.
