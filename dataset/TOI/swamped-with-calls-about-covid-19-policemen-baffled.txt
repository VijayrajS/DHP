Allahabad: Swamped with calls about Covid-19, policemen baffled
2020-03-21
PRAYAGRAJ: Panic calls about Covid-19 suspects roaming the city and its adjoining areas have left police in Prayagraj bewildered amid the global coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 2 lakh worldwide and over 200 in the country, including 23 in UP.

In the past 72 hours, police stations and officers have received more than 36 calls.

“Apart from dialling 112, people from trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets and the city are calling their respective thana in-charge or some senior police officer to make such claims,” SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj told TOI. 

Most of these calls are being made in Ghurpur, Manda, Meja, Sarayinayat, Soroan, Naini and Kotwali police station areas. The callers are complaining about people sneezing and coughing in public places instead of staying at home. They are demanding immediate police action. Some complainants even reached police stations to seek help, Pankaj said.

The number of calls has increased in the past couple of days ever since news of both suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases started pouring in from different parts of the country. Cops are swamped with queries ranging from precautionary measures to exact number of cases and quarantine facilities in UP. 

The state police headquarters has already issued guidelines asking district police to respond to these calls promptly and carefully so as to not create further panic. “Police stations have been categorically asked to keep strict vigil on social media to stem fake news, which are likely to be at the root of panic calls,” the SSP said.

Officers are calmly responding to calls, assuring people that those found with symptoms of the viral infection are being taken to health centres and hospitals for screening, Pankaj added.
