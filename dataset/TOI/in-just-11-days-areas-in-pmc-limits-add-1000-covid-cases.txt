PUNE: The first 1,000 Covid-19 cases within the Pune Municipal Corporation limits emerged over a period of 48 days. But the most recent batch of 1,000 cases was added within just 11 days. 

By Wednesday, the number of positive cases within PMC limits had hit the 2,000 mark.





The new tally takes the number of cases within the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) — including PMC, PCMC, and rural areas — beyond the 2,300 mark.

But besides the increase in positive cases, authorities have also reported an increase in the number of cured patients. Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of the PMC said in the past seven days, over 50 patients have been cured and discharged daily. “Active positive cases against the total positive is now 65%. On April 28, it was 79%. Efforts are underway to further reduce the positive case load,” Agarwal added.

A total of 665 Covid-19 patients were discharged until Wednesday within the PMR. The number included 584 from the PMC limits, 56 from PCMC limits and 25 from rural areas.

Since the beginning of this month, nearly 313 patients have been declared infection-free and discharged within PMC limits. 

The first two cases within PMC limits emerged on March 9 after a couple who had returned from a trip to Dubai tested positive. 

Since then, the PMC area has witnessed a steady increase in cases. Detection too has gone up significantly in the past two weeks with more than 50% cases being added to the tally. 

Data released by the district heath office indicates the PMC area crossed 500 Covid-19 cases on April 18 and breached the 1,000-mark on April 25. The jump to 2,000 cases came in just 11 days with a daily average addition of 90 cases.

Officials with the PMC said the corporation's containment plan hopes to arrest the spread the infection. While much of the sealing has been removed now, 69 micro-clusters with a high number of positives have been identified by authorities. Most of these micro-clusters have formed within the jurisdictions of five civic wards, including Bhavani Peth, Shivajinagar, Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori, Kasba-Vishrambaug and Dhole Patil road. The administration has boosted contact tracing, surveillance and health screenings at these locations. 

On May 6, the were 86 positive cases reported within PMC limits. On May 5 and May 4 the fresh case load was 65 and 64 respectively. The increase in the number of cases is also due to ramped up testing, contact tracing and screening.
