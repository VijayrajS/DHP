Hyderabad: The All India Majlis-e-Inquilab-e-Millat has urged chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao to intervene in what they called the “dismal functioning” of the Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) amid the lockdown.

“The board has failed to pay honorarium of Imams and Mauzzins despite having funds. The locking of record room issue is yet to be discussed and no one seems to be concerned to raise it. Similarly, TSWB held a meeting during lockdown to pass an illegal resolution without a quorum, in haste, to selectively hand over Waqf properties to TMREIS which is against Manshayey Waqf,’’ said party president Syed Taraq Quadri.

Quadri, while appreciating the GHMC’s efforts to expedite work on flyovers and other projects, sought to draw the civic body’s attention to maintenance work on the Mecca Masjid and urged them to attend to it immediately.
