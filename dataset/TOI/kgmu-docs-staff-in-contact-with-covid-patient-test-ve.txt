LUCKNOW: KGMU authorities heaved a sigh of relief after 20 of its healthcare staff members, including three doctors, who had come in contact with a 64-year-old Covid-19 patient, tested negative to coronavirus infection on Tuesday.


However, a 45-year-old relative of the patient from Nazirabad area has been tested positive. “The patient’s relative has mild flu-like symptoms and has been sent to health centre at Bakshi Ka Talab,” chief medical officer Dr Narendra Agarwal said.

The elderly patient, who was suffering from severe respiratory syndrome, was on Saturday brought to the trauma centre where doctors provided him oxygen support before sending him to the triage where suspected Covid-19 patients are admitted.

His test report was received on Monday which confirmed coronavirus infection. Subsequently, KGMU put 65 health personnel, including 13 doctors, 40 nurses and ward boys, 10 sanitation workers and two security guards, under quarantine.

About 300 family members of all 65 personnel were also asked to isolate themselves at home.

KGMU spokesperson Prof Sudhir Singh said protocol was properly followed in handling the case.

“Staff members who had come in direct contact with the patient during treatment in emergency ward and medicine unit have tested negative for Covid-19. However, they will still have to spend 14 days in quarantine as a precautionary measure,” said Dr D Himanshu, in charge of infectious diseases unit.

“The other 45 people had indirectly come in contact with the patient. This means that they met those who were in direct contact with the patient. As the direct contacts are not infected, all others are safe and will not require quarantine,” said Dr Sandeep Tiwari, a member of KGMU’s Covid-19 task force.

Meanwhile, the elderly patient continued to be on ventilator for the second day, though doctors said that he was responding to treatment. “He is still critical but his oxygen requirement has decreased and medication has stabilised blood pressure,” said Dr Himanshu.

After the Covid-19 case was detected on Monday, Naya Gaon in Nazirabad which houses about 1,000 people was sealed by the district administration for scanning.

Six members of the patient’s family have been quarantined in a hospital at Hussainganj and their test swab test reports are awaited.
