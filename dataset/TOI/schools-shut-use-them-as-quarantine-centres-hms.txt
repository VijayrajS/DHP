Schools shut, use them as quarantine centres: HMs
2020-04-27
Nagpur: The Headmasters’ Association plans to approach authorities and offer school premises as quarantine centres to accommodate in view of the coronavirus outbreak. The association is a body of principals from private-aided schools who feel thus the vacant buildings can be put to use. Madhusudhan Mude, president of the association, said, “We receive our salaries from the government and in a way this can be considered our duty to offer not only our services but also the infrastructure in the hour of crisis. We will be writing to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in which it will be clearly mentioned that school principals are ready to contribute in whichever way possible.”These aided schools are those which are run by private management but receive financial grants from the state government. These grants are for both salary and non-salary purpose. In return, the schools are obligated to not charge fee from students for the sections which come under aided category. Mude said, “The lockdown started in the third week of March and since then our school buildings are lying vacant and we are aware schools will be the last thing to open even after the lockdown exit plan is put into action. Even the earliest that schools would start is July, though that seems unrealistic. Hence, it is best if government makes use of our school buildings as quarantine centres.” Mude said the association has hundreds of members spread over the district. “Easiest way to go about this would be for authorities to tell us which area and what capacity they require in the centre. Since not every school will have the same type of infrastructure, we can then match the requirements from among our members and offer them the choice,” said Mude.
