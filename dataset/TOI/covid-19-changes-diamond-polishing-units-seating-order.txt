Covid-19 changes diamond polishing units’ seating order
2020-06-10
Surat: With social distancing the only mantra for the new normal in the Covid-impacted society, its rippling effect can be felt in the industries, including the Surat’s famed diamond-cutting and polishing centres, too. Many a traditional practices are being revised now owing to the rules including seating arrangements besides the working style.

So, what was always a square story behind every emery wheel since ages, will now be a rectangular one retold to ensure physical distancing among the polishers using the polishing equipment. So, instead of the traditional four, each table will be occupied by only two polishers at a time.

Ashit Mehta, chairman of Blue Star diamond company told TOI, “With the rectangular sitting arrangement, we have successfully created more than one metre distance between two workers and also introduced shift system in three-day rotation to follow social distancing norms.” 

Regional chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), Dinesh Navadiya, said that the new seating arrangements is here to stay. “This is the best option to keep workers safe in the units. Less than 35% of the diamond units have reopened owing to shortage of workers,” he added.

Hitesh Patel, managing director of Dharmandan Diamonds Private Limited, too, agrees that maintaining social distancing on the emery wheel, which is almost impossible, can only have this only one option — to adjust number of people in shifts. 

“Rectangular format of diamond polishing is the new normal in the industry. With this we are operating our factory at less than 40% capacity and on rotational basis to maintain social distancing,” Patel added.
