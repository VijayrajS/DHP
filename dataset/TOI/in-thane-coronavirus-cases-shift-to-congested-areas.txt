2020-04-27
THANE: Seventeen new positive cases were reported from Thane on Sunday, taking the total tally of patients in the city to 226. The cases have seen a shift from upmarket localities to densely populated, middle-income enclaves, reveals a civic study.


Data from TMC shows that densely populated Mumbra has reported the most cases at (42) till date, followed by the equally congested Lokmanya Nagar (31) and Uthalsar (30) cases. In comparison, Vartak Nagar ward that had the most cases till mid-April was restrained at 23 and Manpada-Majiwada had 22.

Officials admitted that the cases were shifting towards dense localities and claimed contact transmission for the spread which was straining the administration and local netas to ensure total compliance to lockdown and prevent an outbreak in their areas. “Majority residents with an international travel history were identified and contained in time but few might have been infected and come in contact with others and spread the infection before being quarantined. We are working on a warfooting to trace high-risk contacts so that there is no further spread and ensuring lockdown in affected areas,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy civic commissioner.
