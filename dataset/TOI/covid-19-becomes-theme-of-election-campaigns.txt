2020-03-16
VISAKHAPATNAM: No sooner had party campaigns for local elections had begun than the state election commission (SEC) deferred them by six weeks due to the threat of Covid-19. The election process is likely to resume after the arrest of the spread of coronavirus and normalcy is restored.


So far campaigns, which had just begun in the city, mostly focused on coronavirus scare. Some candidates distributed pamphlets on dos and don’ts to protect against coronavirus in addition to the details of the contestant and his election agenda, while others enquired about voters’ health as part of door-to-door campaigns. 

But the decision to defer the polls has forced several party candidates to rethink their polls plans. For instance, sources said several contestants keep liquid cash ready to meet day to day expenditure of campaigning. 

“It is not safe to keep so much liquid cash in our possession. We will see what to do now,” said a contestant from the city.
