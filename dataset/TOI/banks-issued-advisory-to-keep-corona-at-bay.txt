2020-03-19
BHUBANESWAR: The finance department has asked all banks to advise their customers not to visit bank branches/ATMs except when it is urgent, and to use mobile banking or internet banking services.


In an advisory issued to the state-level bankers’ committee (SLBC), the department has also asked banks to notify a dedicated phone number to customers for transaction-related queries that would help reduce the number of visitors to the bank’s branches.

The banks have been asked to open more counters and allow customers inside branches in small batches. All staff members should use masks during office hours, keep sufficient hand sanitisers/hand wash/soaps in the wash rooms and staff members must clean their hands at regular intervals, stated the advisory. 

The banks have also been asked to keep hand sanitisers at ATM counters and advised customers to use it after the transactions. Instructions have also been issued to put up posters and banners on coronavirus awareness prominently in bank branches and ATMs and send bulk SMSes to customers. “Allow customers to enter ATMs one by one and never allow more than one at a time,” said the advisory.

To ensure safety of banking correspondents (BC) working in rural areas (in the unbanked areas), the banks have been asked to advise the BCs to use masks and carry hand sanitisers with them while visiting rural areas for bank-related activities.
