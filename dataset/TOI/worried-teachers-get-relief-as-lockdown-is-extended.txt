Goa: Worried teachers get relief as lockdown is extended
2020-04-15
PANAJI: In a relief for the state’s teachers chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday put on hold orders asking them to report to work from Wednesday. Sawant’s decision came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the lockdown to May 3.


“Goa has hundreds of government primary schools where there is only a single teacher running the school, with not even as much as a sweeper or peon. What would these teachers do sitting alone in these schools? The decision to put on hold orders asking teachers to report to work from Wednesday has come as a huge relief,” a teacher said.

Orders to report back on duty had left many teachers worried on account of public transportation. “Even if Kadamba buses ply, it will only be on the highways. A majority of government schools are located in the interiors. Nearly 90% of Goa’s teachers are females and many do not drive or ride and rely on public transport. Even on regular days, on Divar island, a male teacher can be seen transporting two female teachers at a time from the ferry point to the school on a bike,” said another teacher.

Teachers also said that going by instructions from the directorate of education, they had completed the work of paper corrections and preparation of results at home. In these circumstances, there would be nothing to do at school, they said.

Meanwhile, staffers of private professional colleges in Goa, four engineering colleges and one pharmacy college, said that there is ambiguity on when they should be joining work.

“ The directorate of technical education has said that all gazetted officers under it should join work after April 20. But staffers of private colleges are not gazetted officers and there is no clarity forthcoming,” said faculty of a private engineering college.
