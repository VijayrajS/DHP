4 hosps reserved for Covid-19 cases, others reel under more patient inflow
2020-03-28
Dehradun: With four state government medical colleges exclusively earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 cases, the other hospitals in the state are facing issues due to the sudden increase in the number of patients at their facilities.

A spot visit by TOI to city’s Gandhi Shatabdi Hospital on Friday revealed how patients and their relatives were crammed in small rooms at a time when social distancing is critical. In the women and infants’ ward of the hospital, around 30-35 people were present inside a 16x14 room with a capacity of six beds. While two pregnant women were lying on their respective beds, their kin were occupying the area near the bedside. Some were even sitting on the floor.

Further, at a time when an infectious disease is rampant and cleanliness should be paramount, the sainitation in the wards left much to be desired. Also, there were no sanitisers available for patients and their attendants and the washrooms in the ward didn’t have soaps.

When asked about this situation from hospital doctors, they expressed their helplessness saying that even after repeated requests and warnings, the kin of patients are not ready to leave the hospital. They added that the hospital got burdened after the women’s ward of Government Doon Medical College and Hospital was shifted here two days ago.

“We have asked the kin of patients several times to leave the rooms and sit in the rest area on the ground floor but they hardly pay heed to our requests. They are risking the lives of their own kin. The work burden has increased for the hospital staff due to the influx of the patients,” Dr Praveen Pawar, acting in-charge of Gandhi Shatabdi Hospital, told TOI. The official added that the hospital’s request for additional staff is pending for approval with the state government.

Other medical facilities are also facing a similar pressure due to increased patient inflow.
