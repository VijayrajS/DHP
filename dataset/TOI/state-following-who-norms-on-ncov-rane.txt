Goa following WHO norms on coronavirus: Vishwajit Rane
2020-02-11
PANAJI: The state has a vigil mechanism in place to track and monitor people coming to Goa from China, health minister Vishwajit Rane, said.


To a question if a separate place for isolation, rather than a ward in a hospital, would have been safer, Rane replied that the state was following WHO guidelines as well directions issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

A ward each in Goa Medical College and hospital, Bambolim and Cottage Hospital at Chicalim, have been earmarked to quarantine and treat suspected cases of nCoV. 

The state has 23 persons under observation. Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, state epidemiologist, said a male patient is being treated for pneumonia; his samples have tested negative for nCoV.

Besides the Mormugao port, medical staff have been posted at the Goa international airport to record passengersâ€™ temperatures.
