Pithoragarh: More than 600 Nepalese labourers, on their way back to their country, have been stranded at Dharchula, as Nepal on Monday extended its lockdown for the next eight days. 

Most of the labourers are from districts in Nepal adjoining Pithoragarh. 

After India went into lockdown last week, they decided to return home. But with Nepal also imposing lockdown simultaneously, they got stranded at Dharchula.

One of the stranded men, Man Bahadur, said, “I walked 45 km with my wife and two children from Didihat, reaching Dharchula on March 29, in the hope the suspension bridge across the border here would be open. But the Nepal government did not open the gates on Monday, so we are forced to stay here.” 

Another Nepalese citizen, Deepak Kumar, said he had walked from Pangla, 35 km away.Although Nepal had closed the border with India between March 23 and 29, it allowed 215 and 160 workers respectively on both dates to cross the suspension bridges at the borders in Dharchula and Jhulaghat on March 27, said Pithoragarh DM Vijay Kumar Jogdande. But on Monday, the Nepal government extended its lockdown till April 7, and did not open the borders, he added, even as more Nepalese arrived, hoping to cross over.The DM said that the district administration will make arrangements for shelter and food for those stranded.

Meanwhile, civil society groups like Rung Museum, Garbyal Mahila Sangh and Pahari Jayaka are also arranging rations for the stranded Nepalese, said Salu Datal, a local resident. 

Meanwhile, sources said that four of the stranded labourers decided to swim across the Kali river, which forms the natural border between the two countries , to reach Nepal. Three of them managed to cross over, where they were immediately arrested by Nepal Police. The fourth person turned back from mid-river.
