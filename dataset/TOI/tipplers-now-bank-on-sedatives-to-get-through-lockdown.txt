Tipplers now bank on sedatives to get through lockdown
2020-04-04
Vijayawada: After a rise in consumption of toddy in the state, the consumption of sedatives also reported an increase, with tipplers visiting pharmacies for sleeping pills and painkillers, which contain nitrazepam. 

The hike in demand follows the non-availability of liquor in retail as well as black markets after the nationwide lockdown was announced

Fearing that unregulated use of sedatives could pose health risks, pharmacies in the state have stopped selling sedatives and even cough syrups to people without a prescription. In some areas, owners of pharmacies are turning customers back claiming they have no stock.

The joint director of Drug Control Administration (DCA), Andhra Pradesh, P Vinay Kumar said there are over 25,000 pharmacies (wholesale, retail and attached to hospitals) in the state. “They have not issued any orders related to banning orders on sedatives and have insisted on a valid prescription from medical professionals to sell some categories of drugs which largely include sedatives of all forms to mitigate the misuse of the sedatives during the lockdown,” he added.

Sources said that Diazepam tablets, including Alprax, Alzolam and other varieties like Fortwin (painkiller) injections were the most commonly-used sedatives in Andhra Pradesh and a majority of users are the youth.

Owners of some pharmacies said they are hesitating to procure stocks of sedatives following the surge in demand from tipplers. Minimum quantities, however, are in stock for customers who use the drugs on prescription, they added.
