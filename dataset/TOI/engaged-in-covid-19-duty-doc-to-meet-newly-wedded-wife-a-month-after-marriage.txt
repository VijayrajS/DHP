2020-04-25
Dehradun: After his marriage on March 21, Dr Akshat Mittal had little idea that he would be able to meet his wife only after a month.

The day after his marriage, Janata Curfew was announced and he got orders to report to the Covid-19 ward of the Doon Hospital. After a month of duty at the hospital during which he stayed at accommodation near the hospital, he was finally allowed to leave on April 22 but was home quarantined.　

His home quarantine will end on Saturday morning when he would be finally able to meet his wife.

Speaking to TOI, Dr Mittal said, “Everyone — doctors, nurses and support staff — is working at the Covid-19 ward at Doon Hospital with a great sense of duty and commitment. So, there was no question of my taking leave even though I had just got married.”　

He added that “in my home, everyone was worried since all of us were in direct contact with the patients but we used PPE kits while taking rounds in the wards where Covid-19-positive patients were under observation.”

During the lockdown, Dr Mittal said he was in touch with his newly-wedded wife, also a doctor, through video calls. The couple had planned a honeymoon to Spain which they were forced to cancel.　

Meanwhile, his wife, Dr Somya Mittal told TOI, “Initially, it was tough for me to digest the fact that right after marriage, my husband will be going away and staying in quarantine.But then as doctors and responsible citizens, our duty comes first. Now I am happy that he is back and his reports are negative.”

The doctor will be joining duty again on May 2.
