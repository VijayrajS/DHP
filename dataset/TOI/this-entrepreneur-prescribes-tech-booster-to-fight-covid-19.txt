Hyderabad: Technology adoption is key to overcoming the language barrier people are facing while dealing with a global pandemic like coronavirus and 39-year-old Sunil Sathyavolu has done exactly that by processing the information in Telugu and reaching out to people in villages.

A techie-turned-entrepreneur, Sathyavolu is using technology to spread messages in Telugu on coronavirus even in remote villages. He believes simplifying the content will fetch guaranteed results. A resident of Neknampur in Rangareddy district, Sathyavolu contacts sarpanches of gram panchayats who, in turn, spread messages on mikes and circulate them among villagers. 

People also get messages on their mobiles on ways to fight the virus and stay safe. He breaks down more complex issues to make them relatable to the villagers. “Lockdown is like a vaccination every citizen has to go through for survival. Like a newborn baby does not find vaccination pleasant but remains healthy because if it, the same logic holds true for adults during the lockdown,” he says.

Meanwhile, village heads said the campaign in Telugu came as a blessing in disguise for them to reach out to villagers. “I addressed 1,500 people on the virus and they now know something seriously has gone wrong and that they need to be cautious. That is why everyone is staying back in their homes and practising social distancing,” Vijay Bhaskar Kunduri, upa sarpanch of Anjalipuram village in Suryapet, told TOI.
