NEW DELHI: The positivity rate of Covid-19 in Delhi is as high as 27%, government data shows.

As per the latest update, 3,700 people underwent Covid-19 testing in the last 24 hours in the national capital. Of them, 1,007 (27%) tested positive.

Last week, the positivity rate (cases confirmed per 100 tests) in Delhi was 26%. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan termed the situation worrisome and said the state government needed to ramp up testing, coupled with aggressive surveillance, contact tracing and stringent containment and perimeter control of hotspots.

However, government data shows sharp decline in testing numbers; from 6,361 on June 4 to 5,187, 5,180 and 3,700 on June 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively. “Some of the labs have been debarred from testing pending enquiry into inconsistencies in following the norms. This could have led to the reduction in testing numbers,” said an official.

Delhi is the third most affected state in the country with over 29,000 Covid cases. The death toll due to the disease mounted to 874 on Monday, with the state authorities confirming 62 more fatalities caused among those infected.

These deaths took place from May 30 to June 6, and 27 of these fatalities occurred on June 5, they said. The highest spike of 1,513 fresh cases was recorded on June 3.

In a bulletin issued on Monday, Delhi health department said the death toll from coronavirus has risen to 874, and the total number of cases was 29,943 at present.

It, however, added that the cumulative death figures refer to fatalities where primary cause of death was found to be Covid-19, as per the report of the Death Audit Committee on the basis of case-sheets received from various hospitals.

Due to the rising number of cases, many people are finding it difficult to get a hospital bed. Delhi government has, therefore, decided to set up round-the-clock helpdesks at various state-run hospitals to ensure smooth and hassle-free admission of patients amid the pandemic, officials said.

These helpdesks will function in two shifts of 12 hours each and consist of two officials of Delhi government and one police constable during night duty hours.
