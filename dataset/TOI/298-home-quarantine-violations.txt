2020-03-25
Vadodara: Gross violation of home quarantine directives continued in the city with the teams of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) health department receiving a series of such complaints. The department has so far had to take help of the police in several cases to ensure people remain inside.

VMC had started collaborating with the police last week to ensure that people advised home isolation do not venture out. VMC officials said that so far it had come to light that 298 persons had moved out of their homes and police had to be roped in to ensure that they do not do so.

“Such cases come to our notice when either the neighbours inform us or when our teams reach their home to check on them and find them missing,” said an official.

The issue was not just about people being found missing, but also about health teams facing heir ire. “They enter into arguments with the team and misbehave,” said the official. In one such incident, the health teams and police had to take a person from Ajwa Road to the quarantine centre located in the same area. It was only after this that the person decided to cooperate. The VMC has also moved four police complaints till now against persons who were violating home quarantine despite instructions. All those who are home quarantined are also served notices asking them to follow the instructions.

So far, 3,897 persons from abroad have reached the city after the outbreak globally. In all, 1,002 persons remain under home quarantine including 291 persons who were advised home isolation on Tuesday.
