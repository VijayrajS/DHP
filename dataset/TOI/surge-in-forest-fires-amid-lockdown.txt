Surge in forest fires amid lockdown
2020-04-10
Hyderabad: A series of forest fires that erupted in Amrabad and Kawal Tiger Reserves of Telangana in the last one week seem to have caused enormous damage to the environment and habitats of numerous animals and plants. 

According to the Forest Survey of India data, forest blocks of both the tiger reserves spread across Jannaram, Mancherial, Nirmal, Nagarkurnool, Kothagudem and Adilabad districts have witnessed a total of nine large forest fires in six days, from April 1 to April 6. The data acquired from the Forest Survey of India also revealed that there were a total of 29 large fires in forests across Telangana in the last one week. 

Wildlife conservationists say the tiger reserve, which is one of the biggest tiger habitats in the country, is home to countless species of birds, animals, insects and herbs, which are threatened due to unchecked fires every year. 

“The fires are most likely a result of lack of monitoring by forest staff and locals entering forests to cut trees illegally or encroach upon the forest land. There needs to be strict vigil in Kawal,” a wildlife conservationist said.

While Amrabad forest officials were not available for a response, Jannaram Forest Divisional Officer S Madhav Rao said, “The fires in Jannaram division of Kawal have increased during the lockdown as people, especially those who were once habitual smugglers, seem to be entering into the forest and causing these fires.” “We have restricted their movement by increasing vigil. We have also set up fire lines for every 200 or 300 metres so that the fires are controlled even if our staff is not able to reach the spot soon. In our division, per day, we are receiving two to four fire alerts,” said Rao, adding that the highest number of fires were recorded between March 30 and April 1 this year.
