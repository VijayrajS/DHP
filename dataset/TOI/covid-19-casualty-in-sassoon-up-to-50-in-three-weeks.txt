Covid-19 casualty in Sassoon Hospital up to 50 in three weeks
2020-04-25
PUNE: The Sassoon General Hospital reported the 50th Covid-19 casualty on Friday, 22 days after the state-run health hub registered the first death due to the contagion. 


The two casualties reported at Sassoon hospital on Friday were that of woman (61) from the Parvati Darshan area and a 40-year-old man from Shikrapur. While the woman had existing conditions of myocarditis, hypothyroidism and obesity, the man was a chronic alcoholic for 20 years, hospital officials said. 



On April 2, the designated Covid-19 hospital of the city had registered its first Covid-19 casualty when a 50-year-old woman from Raviwar Peth succumbed to novel coronavirus (Covid-19)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Health experts monitoring the Covid-19 outbreak in Pune said the Sassoon hospital was receiving patients mostly when their condition has already worsened. Besides, a major section of these patients was from the densely-populated peth areas of the city. 

Murulidhar Tambe, deputy dean of BJ Medical college and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “The chances of recovery are high if a Covid-19 patient is brought to hospital at the early stage. Patients and their relatives must ensure early reporting to hospital. Besides, additional care is a must for patients with comorbidity factors 

Hospital officials said though infrastructure and facilities, such as medical equipment and ventilators, were reaching the institute, its limited space was a big concern. “Intensive care units at hospital are in limited numbers. Admission of critical patients has been high. Accommodating all of them is a tough task. The private hospital should come forward and assist us in providing ICU facilities,” said a senior official at Sassoon hospital.
