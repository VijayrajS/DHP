2020-06-07
VIJAYAWADA: The Kosigi quarantine centre in Kurnool town was vacated and shut down on Friday, a day after a migrant worker attempted suicide, fearing the presence of ghosts. 


On Thursday morning, a 47-year-old migrant worker tried to hang himself from a window frame in his room using a piece of cloth.

Upon hearing the sounds of a windowpane breaking, the migrant worker’s fellow roommates and medical staff rushed to stop the suicide attempt. Officials shifted the 47-year-old to Adoni Government Hospital. He was discharged on Saturday and sent home for 14 days of home quarantine.

Health officials said the worker had previously approached them and claimed that the centre was haunted and requested he be sent home. His request, however, was turned down with officials citing the reason as ‘absurd’. Officials said the quarantine centre has 113 migrant workers and rumours of it being haunted soon spread amongst them. 

The migrant worker had been placed in quarantine after his wife tested positive for Covid-19. 

N Keerthi Priya, in charge of the Kosigi quarantine centre, said that around seven patients have been shifted to the Viswabharati Covid-19 hospital, while other migrant workers have been quarantined for 14 days.

Medical experts have drawn attention to the need for clinical psychologists in quarantine centres, citing a rise in cases of depression as people are being forced to stay in isolation.
