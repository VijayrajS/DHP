2020-04-04
GANDHINAGAR: In a bid to ensure that there is no spread of coronavirus because of poor handling of biomedical waste of patients, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) has drawn up guidelines to handle such waste and also formed special teams to handle and monitor proper disposal of Covid-19 biomedical waste (BMW).

GPCB member secretary A V Shah said, “In view of the novel coronavirus pandemic , the central pollution control board has published guidelines for handling, treatment and disposal of waste generated during treatment/diagnosis/quarantine of Covid-19 patients. 

GPCB has directed all the common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities (CBMWTFs) to follow the guidelines of CPCB strictly and ensure disposal of biomedical waste from healthcare facilities/institutions.”

BMW generated from healthcare facilities (HCFs) is disposed of through 20 operational CBMWTFs located in various part of the state having capacity to handle 71,000 kg waste per day. GPCB is monitoring biomedical waste management through its 27 regional offices located in the state. “We have formed special teams for strict monitoring of activities,’’ Shah added.
