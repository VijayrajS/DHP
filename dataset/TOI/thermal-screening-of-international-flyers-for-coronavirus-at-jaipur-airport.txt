Thermal screening of international flyers for coronavirus at Jaipur airport
2020-03-05
JAIPUR: Amid coronavirus concerns, the Jaipur International Airport administration is taking measures to ensure that no international passengers leave the airport without going through the thermal screening. 


The screening is being done on passengers of international flights and chartered planes. Many domestic tourists have expressed fear that only announcements are made in domestic flights asking persons feeling unwell to get in touch with airport authorities. However, their screening has not been done.

"All the passengers irrespective of their nationality should be screened as they have travelled together with people who are suspected. Due to lack of infrastructure, they are not screening all the passengers," said a passenger. An official at Jaipur airport said, "Foreign tourists travelling in domestic flights have been asked to fill a medical form. International flights' tourists are being checked thoroughly." 

Residents of many districts in the state including Jodhpur and Udaipur have also expressed fears that foreign tourists are not being screened as there is no thermal screening facility. These airports have not been equipped as there are no direct flights. International tourists reached these tourist destinations using domestic flights. Manta Singh, a resident of Udaipur said, "There should be a foolproof system at these airports where thousands of international tourists reach daily via different flights. If they move out of airport without screening, a risk is always there." 

Yogesh Kumar Gujjar, officiating director at Udaipur airport said, "We have no directions to screen the tourists coming by domestic flights. On the directions of the medical and health department, we are acting when they give us specific input on suspected coronavirus passengers. So far, we have sent two tourists and handed them over to the medical and health department."
