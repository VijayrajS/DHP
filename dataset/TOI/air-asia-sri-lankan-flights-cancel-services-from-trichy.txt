TRICHY: The Kuala Lumpur-bound Air Asia and Malindo Air and Colombo-bound Sri Lankan Airlines have suspended their services for a brief period from Trichy international airport, as the airlines are witnessing poor passenger traffic following the advancing Covid-19 and subsequent travel advisory issued by the civil aviation authorities.


Sri Lankan Airlines has been operating two services a day from Trichy to Colombo. They have cancelled the morning service – arrival at Trichy at 9.10 am and departure to Colombo at 10.10 am-- for three days from March 16 to 18, for three days, authorities said.

Meanwhile, sources from the airlines said that they are also going to cancel the evening service – which arrives here at 3.05 pm and leaves to Colombo at 4.05 pm, for 13 days from March 19. Sri Lankan flight acts as a connecting flight for Trichy passengers who have to travel to several gulf countries. However, due to the announcement made by the gulf countries restricting international flights, citing Covid-19 threat, the passenger traffic has considerably come down.
