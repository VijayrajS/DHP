DEHRADUN: Health officials of Pauri district are going door-to-door to locate people who, according to them, had recently visited China. Majority of these people live in Dehradun or Rishikesh and have paternal homes in Pauri. However, two of them had given incorrect phone numbers and incomplete address in their Local Intelligence Unit report, which is why, officials said it has become difficult for the health department to trace them. Pauri additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Ramesh Kunwar told TOI that local police had alerted the health department that around 12 people from Pauri had recently visited China.

“Our information was based upon the inputs from local intelligence unit. Though it was announced that people must come for initial screening, no one approached us in the last week. Now, we are going door-to-door to find out if they are affected with coronavirus or not,” said the ACMO.

Till Friday, the Pauri health team had managed to scan four people in Rishikesh and one in Pauri.

“We managed to track the addresses of six others as well. They had given the address of their ancestral houses in Pauri but some of them live in Dehradun and some in Kotdwar. Two people had mentioned that they are from Pauri. They didn’t furnish their correct house address and even phone numbers that they gave are not working,” said the ACMO, while claiming that all those who were screened had no symptoms of coronavirus and most of them were yoga teachers in China.
