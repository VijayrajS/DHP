Goa: House help more vulnerable to coronavirus threat
2020-03-20
COLVA: While the government is concentrating on people with a travel history to contain coronavirus, the weaker sections of society in the slum areas of Monte Dongor and Azad Nagar in Margao seem to have been ignored.

Hundreds of women residing here work on an hourly basis in Margao in different households. They do household chores and work in business establishments too.

Their work schedule brings them in contact with a huge chunk of the town’s affluent population, many of whom could be frequent flyers.

For a few weeks now, health services in coordination with immigration officials have been keeping a check on individuals and their families who have been home quarantined. However, there is no mechanism in place to screen the maids who work in such houses.

Health officer, urban health centre, Dr Anju Kharangate was taken aback when this question was posed to her. She said that health officials have been requesting people to come forward and bring such cases to their notice.

A doctor who had recently visited a Gulf country is undergoing self-imposed 14-day quarantine. He informed TOI that twice a day health officials visit his residence. 

He also said that before his travel, he had discontinued his maid’s services and she has not been asked to resume work.

Another flat owner said that in his complex there are many businessmen who frequently travel abroad. The maids employed by them work in other flats too, he said.

“Health officials may not come across maids when they do routine checks at the premises of the quarantined person. They should conduct a survey of all maids and screen them,” he said.

Yet another individual said that if one or two maids contract coronavirus in these affluent houses, it will spread like wild fire in the slums. He demanded drastic steps to prevent the spread.
