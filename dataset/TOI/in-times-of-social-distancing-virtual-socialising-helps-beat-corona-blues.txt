In times of social distancing, virtual socialising helps beat coronavirus blues
2020-03-24
HYDERABAD: While emphasis is being given on social distancing to break the coronavirus chain, an IT consultant from Hyderabad has launched a virtual socialising platform to beat the Covid-19 blues. London-based Uday Nagaraju (40), who kicked off #virtualsocialisingchallenge, says he came up with the idea to help the elderly, who are most vulnerable to the virus attack. 


Virtual socialising could mean anything — a video chat over tea, snacks, lunch, drinks or just a call to say hello. “I have been speaking to my friends virtually, sharing a cup of tea in the absence of being able to actually meet them,” Nagaraju told TOI over phone. He said benefits of his platform were mostly aimed at helping the elderly overcome fears on the virus and combat the pandemic. 

A co-founder of Global Policy Insights, Nagaraju said he launched the initiative to get people stay in touch with one another without risking their physical well-being. “Extreme social distancing is the only way to minimise the spread of Covid-19. I also feel there an increasing need to raise awareness on the mental health of the people.”

He said there is a flood of information on social media and people are confused on which is real news and which is fake news. “It is a huge strain on people’s emotional well-being,” he observed.

Among the many people Nagaraju caught up with include British diplomats — David White and Andrew Fleming — deputy country representative of India, UN Women, Nishtha Satyam and film producer Yash Rangineni. When contacted, Fleming, British deputy high commissioner to Telangana, agreed that thanks to the present global situation people were not able to meet their friends. 

“I strongly subscribe to virtual socialising. It is even more important in these difficult times. I will start challenging others to get into virtual socialising through my Twitter and Instagram accounts,” he said.
