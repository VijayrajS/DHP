2020-03-06
VADODARA: Breathe easy, but drive cautiously. Or wear a mask to escape cops breathing down your mouth till the Coronavirus scare stays alive for the next few days. Every night, however, different teams of police patrol and check vehicles in several areas wherein a few cases of drunken driving are still reported on a daily basis. 


With virus in the red, the police have decided not to use breath analyzers in the coming days. City police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut said that he has asked his staff to refrain from using breath analyzers to catch tipplers. “We don’t usually use breath analyzers except on select occasions. But I have asked my staff not to use it now especially for the Coronavirus scare,” Gahlaut told TOI. tnn
