Nashik: Migrants workers, students, and stranded tourists who are stuck anywhere across the country can now return home by simply contacting the tehsildars of the place they are stuck at and providing all the necessary details. 

The same will then be forwarded to the district collector of the place they are stranded in as well as the district collectors of their respective hometowns. After approval from both the ends, the said people will be allowed to travel home. The news has brought respite to many who are stuck away from home due to the nationwide lockdown. 

“This is good news for unregistered workers and those who are stranded across the state. While the list of migrant workers who have been put up in shelter homes is ready with the district administration, there are tourists, students, pilgrims and others who have been stranded at various places. They too will be able to return home after seeking necessary permission from the district collectors of their native places,” deputy collector Nitin Mundaware said. 

The movement of people from one place to another will only be allowed if the officers of the corresponding areas allow the departure or arrival. “The movement will begin only after a complete health check-up of the people and on the condition that they will be quarantined after reaching their homes,” the Mundaware said, adding that the respective officials of the state and the centre have to be informed about the entire process and comply with it. 

Any person whose health is questionable at the time of initiating the travel will be declined permission to travel. Also, he/she will receive treatment before being allowed to commence the journey further, Mundaware added.
