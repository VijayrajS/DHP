NAGPUR: A 51-year-old homeopathic practitioner from Bada Tajbagh tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday becoming first case from South Nagpur. Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) preliminary investigation indicated that the woman may have contracted the disease from one of her patients. She is probably first Covid-19 positive medical practitioner in Vidarbha.


Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Wednesday notified containment zone into two parts considering Nirala Society on Umred road and Tajabad Aazad Colony as epicentres. The boundaries of the Nirala Society containment zone are Lucky Chicken Centre on Umred road, Bara Kholi General Stores, Cure It Hospital and Dighori square.

The boundaries of zone of Tajabad Aazad Colony are SBI Umred Road branch, Thakur plot, bridge on nullah at Azad Colony, masjid and Taj Minar bakery on Umred road.

The doctor’s home is in Nirala Society and clinic at Tajabad Aazad Colony.

NMC additional medical officer health Dr Praveen Gantawar told TOI, “Patient’s husband and son are negative. Patient claimed they had not travelled to any containment zones in the city since lockdown. She ran her clinic till April 26. She used to treat a person from Kharbi who had severe cough. The person had returned from Raipur,” he said.

The woman’s second sample tested positive on Wednesday. She was taking treatment for cough and throat infection from a general physician at Sakkardara. She went to GMCH and gave samples on April 27. Her reports were negative on April 30 but she was quarantined at MLA Hostel.

Now, NMC will quarantine her patients and close contacts. Also, NMC will quarantine and test the doctor treating her and his staff at Sakkardara.

Until this one, South Nagpur was the only assembly segment in city not to have a single case of Covid-19.
