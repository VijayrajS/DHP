Hyderabad: After recording single-digit numbers for the past few days, Telangana on Thursday reported three deaths and 22 new Covid-19 cases.

Authorities said the deaths were recorded within 24 hours of admission at Gandhi Hospital, the nodal centre for Covid-19 cases, as the coronavirus caseload reached 1038 with 28 deaths.

After a sudden spurt of 22 cases on Thursday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao conducted a review with officials and asked them to be more vigilant in containment zones.

“The number of cases increased as two people in Malakpet area got infected and in turn, had infected three shop owners and their family members,” health minister Eatala Rajender said.

“We have sent their families to government isolation centres and declared Pahadishareef and Ganz areas as containment zones,” Rajender added.

A 48-year-old man from Ramanthapur was among the three dead. He was suffering from obesity, diabetes, and quickly developed pneumonia

A 76-year-old man from Vanasthalipuram with heart and kidney-related ailments and a 44-year-old woman from Jiaguda with diabetes among other ailments were the remaining two persons who succumbed to Covid-19.

Altogether, 33 people were discharged, including a 50-year-old doctor. “The state government is following all the guidelines of the central government, and the Union home ministry has also recognized this,” the health minister said. He said 568 people are receiving treatment in designated Covid- 19 hospitals across the state.
