Jhansi: As many as 300 NCC cadets from over a dozen degree colleges across the district have come forward to help the local administration in enforcing the ongoing lockdown in their respective areas. All these cadets are from 36 and 56 UP battalion.

Around 75 cadets were seen in the city in small groups at various crossings on Thursday persuading the people to stay at home and not to loiter around aimlessly. A large number of the cadets on field were girls. 

Assuring the battalion’s full cooperation, col Aman Yadav, CO 56 Battalion NCC said that all the cadets were willing and committed to ensure that the lockdown is implemented in its letter and spirit. 

As per professor Sunil Kabia, associate NCC officer, the cadets will work on a daily basis from 10 am to 2 pm in coordination with the police who will guide them for day-to-day assignments. 

“They will work on four levels such as enforcing total lockdown, ensuring maintenance of social distancing in public places such as markets and banks, rebutting fake news and helping to identify poor and elderly people so that relief packages could be sent to them,” said professor Kabia.

Officer Hitika Yadav, who is leading the girl cadets said, “My friends and I are determined to serve the needy during such extreme circumstances as this is what we have been taught during the course.”
