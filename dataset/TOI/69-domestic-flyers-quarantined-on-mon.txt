2020-03-24
NAGPUR: On the day TOI reported lack of screening of domestic flyers, the health officials screened and quarantined 69 of them who had returned from foreign countries via other Indian cities. According to district officials, 159 flyers are now put up at the MLA hostel in quarantine. 


TOI had reported on Monday no passenger arriving in a domestic flight was screened either on Saturday or Sunday. So far, only passengers coming from international flights were being screened. Now as the international flights have been suspended, the screening equipment has been lying idle. 

During normal times, 3,500 passengers reach Nagpur airport. 

Even though the number has reduced drastically, at least 500 passengers may have “escaped” screening.

As only two international flights connect Nagpur, a number of passengers coming from abroad land here in a domestic flight. Hence, a decision to screen domestic passengers also was taken. 

Despite district guardian minister Nitin Raut’s announcement regarding screening domestic passengers arriving at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport for Covid-19, instructions to that effect had not been passed on to the airport operator. 

This first batch of screened domestic flyers is expected to stay here for at least 48 hours. Those residing within city limits would be stamped ‘home quarantined’ and dropped home in special bus. Those staying outside Nagpur district or showing symptoms will have to stay for 14 days.
