Buyers pick veggies over virus
2020-03-25
Vijayawada: Panic buying continued across city markets on Tuesday morning. People in large numbers jostled with one another as they swept items off the shelves. 

The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), as it had announced, established makeshift vegetable markets at Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium (IGMS), Gymkhana grounds, Patamata High school and other open spaces.

Officials permitted the sale of essential commodities from 6 am to 9 am. A soon as they opened the gates at IGMS stadium, thousands of buyers rushed to the stalls ignoring the announcements made on the mics by municipal authorities. Consequently, the police had to intervene to restore order. But that order lasted momentarily as buyers ignored social distancing and resumed scrambling to buy essential commodities. 

Meanwhile, authorities have restricted bulk sale to prevent black marketing. “We have closed Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazar as it is overcrowded, which increases the risk of the virus spreading. Makeshift market at IGMS is spacious and we have allocated stalls, which are at least three meters away from each other. We have urged buyers to maintain queues following the instructions on social distancing. But there is a poor response from the public. Our officials are planning to implement the rules stringently from Wednesday,” said Chandramohan Estate officer at Swarajmaidan Rythu Bazaar. 

Police cleared the crowd after 9 am and directed the sellers to close the stalls. Officials are likley to set up barricades to prevent people jostling in front of stalls from Wednesday.
