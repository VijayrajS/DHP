Fight against Covid-19 will be a ‘long haul’, early reporting of cases key: Dr Paul
2020-05-23
NEW DELHI: Warning that the fight against Covid-19 was going to be a “long haul”, the government stressed on the need for early reporting of cases for better clinical management and to reduce deaths from the infectious disease.

“The fight against Covid-19 is going to be a long haul and its progress in India will depend not just on the behaviour of the virus but also containment measures at the government, community and individual level,” Niti Aayog member (health) Dr V K Paul said.

“The actual disease trajectory will not depend on the virus, it is on us to decide the trajectory depending on how much we resist it by following good health practices,” he added.

“The real trajectory is dependent not only on the maths of the virus’s progression but also in the behaviour of the community and society and the people at large. This cannot be put into an equation,” he said.

Dr Paul also stressed that early detection of cases, effective contact tracing and testing would be key to keep Covid-19 cases and deaths under control in the coming days as the lockdown is now being relaxed.

“We have been able to keep cases and mortalities to reasonable rates so far — so the key is to sustain the momentum we have gained as the lockdown measures are gradually eased,” he said. “But we have to understand that the lockdown cannot continue forever,” he added.

On Friday, the number of confirmed cases reached 118, 447, with a rise of 6,088 cases in 24 hours. A total of 3,583 patients have succumbed to the infection.
