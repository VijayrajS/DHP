VADODARA: With COVID-19 cases being reported across the country, civil hospitals in districts in central Gujarat too have started preparing wards to treat any possible cases of the disease. 


So far, the SSG Hospital (SSGH) at Vadodara was the only treatment centre for suspected virus-infected patients. 

SSGH hospital had prepared an isolation ward with 12 beds to treat serious COVID-19 cases. It also had an additional ward with 60 cases for treatment of cases of the disease that were not very serious. 

Now, the Godhra civil hospital has also prepared a 10-bedded ward to treat any possible COVID-19 cases. Officials of the district administration in Panchmahal held meetings with health department officials to discuss preparedness for the disease. 

Panchmahal district administration has also asked private hospitals in the district to remain prepared in case isolation wards were needed there too. Health officials were asked to spread awareness regarding COVID-19 and ensure that there was no panic or misinformation. 

Similar wards are also being prepared at Lunawada civil hospital in Mahisagar district and the Zydus Medical College and Hospital, the public-private partnership mode hospital, at Dahod. Sources said that the ward will have a capacity of five patients each.
