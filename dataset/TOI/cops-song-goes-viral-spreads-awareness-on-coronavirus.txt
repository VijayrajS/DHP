Coimbatore: A song penned and sung by a constable of the Tamil Nadu Special Police based at Kovaipudur has become popular on social media for helping spread awareness on Covid-19.The song was created by V Pushbaraj, 35, a grade II constable hailing from Kotagiri in Nilgiris district, and received widespread appreciation after it was uploaded on the Smule app, a video production tool.“When I was in school, I used to sing during our annual day function or on important festivals. Later, I began singing during my friends’ wedding. After joining the police force in 2016, I used to sing during my spare time,” said Pushbaraj.The brainwave for the song, Pushbaraj said, was the persistent requests his colleagues and seniors in the police were making for people to stay indoors to contain the novel coronavirus. “Under the present circumstances, Section 144 is in force throughout the country. Even then, a lot of people can be found loitering outside their houses… My song was a means to request people to stay indoors,” he said.Pushbaraj had recorded the song and shared it with a head constable, who was impressed and in turn shared it with his seniors. After seeing the video, senior police officials appreciated his efforts in helping create awareness on the life-threatening pandemic.
