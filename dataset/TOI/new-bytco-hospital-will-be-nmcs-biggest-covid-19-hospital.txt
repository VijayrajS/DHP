Nashik: With 300 beds dedicated for catering to coronavirus patients, the new Bytco Hospital is set to be the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) biggest Covid-9 facility in the city. 

The new facility is an extension of the old building and will be operational soon. 

The city already has Zakir Hussain hospital with 100 beds. The health department is also in the process of increasing the capacity of the facility by 160 beds. 

Moreover, the municipal corporation is also treating Covid-19 patients in the fire brigade quarters located at Nashik Road having bed capacity of 100. 

However, as the cases continue to surge, the NMC is setting up another Covid-19 hospital with capacity of 300 beds. “The civil works, electrification as well as lift works have already been completed. We have just received permission from the standing committee of the NMC to buy 300 beds and other equipment for the New Bytco hospital to treat Covid-19 patients,” said a senior health official from the NMC.

“We will make this 300-bed Covid hospital operational within the next eight days considering the rise in number of patients in the city,” the official added.
