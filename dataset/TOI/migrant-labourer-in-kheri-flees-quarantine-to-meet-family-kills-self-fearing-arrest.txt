Bareilly: A 23-year-old migrant labourer who escaped from a quarantine centre to meet his family in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Fariya Pipariya village allegedly committed suicide late on Tuesday after learning that police were searching for him.

The victim, youngest among six siblings, was quarantined at a school on the village outskirts upon returning from Gurugram on March 28.

According to police, he had escaped from the quarantine centre twice to meet his family, but officials thwarted his attempts on both the occasion and brought him back to the camp.

On Tuesday afternoon, police said he had again escaped from the camp and went to village to meet his family. Upon learning that police were looking for him, the man fled from the place and his body was found hanging on the village outskirts at 11pm on Tuesday, the police said.

The police added the body has been sent for autopsy, and district administration would ensure that the bereaved family get an ex-gratia payment.

Mitauli SDM Digvijay Singh told TOI, “The victim was quarantined following the government’s directions. We even informed them that isolation is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of their family members and neighbours. The victim had fled the camp to meet his family. When police reached the village searching for him, he escaped and was later found hanging. Unfortunately, he committed suicide.”

Maigalganj police station SHO Chandrakant Singh said, “It appears that the victim took the extreme step as he started panicking at the quarantine centre despite repeated attempts by officials to make him understand that it was just a precautionary measure. Authorities have provided proper food and other necessary facilities at the centre. We are investigating the matter and a case will be registered based on the findings.”
