AMRITSAR: A second-year postgraduate student of Government Medical College, Amritsar has tweeted about having suspected symptoms of coronavirus. Dr Parminder Kaur tweeted on Saturday, “As a second-year resident in GMC, Amritsar with symptoms of nCOVID-19 but no test is yet performed, my temperature is 102.3 F and have shortness of breath, if I get any worse my family will not get to meet me at all if one foot unfortunate happens kindly help.”


She tagged Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in her tweet. Talking to TOI on Sunday, Dr Parminder said she was feeling better now but to rule out the possibility of coronavirus, she said she wanted to undergo the virology test.

According to her, she faced the risk of infection as she was deployed at the flu corner and had to visit the emergency department to perform her duties. She said her consultant doctors had advised her to undergo the virology test.

Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Prabhdeep Kaur Johal said doctors attending to her would have given her the best advice. Despite several attempts, GMC principal Dr Sujata Sharma did not answer the phone for comments. 

Sources said two PG students of the medical college who had symptoms of coronavirus and were admitted in the isolation ward were discharged after they tested negative.

In Ajnala, a 25-year-old youth reported to the civil hospital saying he had symptoms. Senior medical officer, Ajnala civil hospital said the youth came to hospital with flu and fever but got better after initial treatment.
