Vadodara: Two persons were arrested by local crime branch of Chhota Udepur police on Saturday for spreading fake messages on WhatsApp.

Police said Jitendra Rathwa and Khuman Rathwa, both residents of Kawant taluka of Chhota Udepur, had spread a false message on WhatsApp to create fear among people about coronavirus. The message mentioned that a man named Nilesh Rathwa from Rangpur village has tested positive for coronavirus so everyone should be careful while keeping in touch with people from his village. On checking with health department, it was learned that no person named Nilesh Rathwa had tested positive for coronavirus.

“Our team of cybercrime branch, which has been keeping a watch on social media and WhatsApp messages, came across this message on April 25 so an offence was registered against unidentified persons. While probing the trail of the message, we found out that these two accused had written this message to create panic,” said a police official.

Police are yet to question the duo why they did this.
