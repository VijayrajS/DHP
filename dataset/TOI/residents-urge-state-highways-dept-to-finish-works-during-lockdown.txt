2020-05-18
Trichy: Trichy residents urged the state highways department to utilize the lockdown period to complete the long-pending road project to eliminate frequent traffic snarls on Chennai-Trichy-Karur national highways. The Anna statue roundabout size reduction which would pave way for seamless traffic on the highway connecting famous tourist destination Srirangam temple is kept pending for over a year now.As traffic bottlenecks were frequently recurring on Chennai-Trichy-Karur NH near Melachinthamani Anna statue roundabout, state highways proposed to reduce the diameter of the roundabout from 10 metres to 6 metres. However, even as the adjoining civil work such as widening the approach roads connecting the roundabout with Chathiram bus stand was completed, the roundabout size reduction work is pending for the past one year. Utilizing the current situation, residents urged the highways department to complete the Rs 40 lakh project. “Highways should utilize the lockdown to reduce the size of Anna roundabout. Once the public transportation resumes, it is going to be difficult,” P Aiyarappan, a resident of Allur said. The approach road connecting Melachinthamani with Anna roundabout is already widened to 12 metres. While residents sought a centre median, highways officials said that the demand cannot be facilitated as the widened road is less than 15 metres wide, a benchmark width to establish median. “We will take up the roundabout size reduction work within a month,” an official with state highways department told TOI.
