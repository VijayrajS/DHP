2020-03-24
AMARAVATI: Covid-19 has not impacted export of marine products from the state, said fisheries minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramanarao on Monday and warned of serious consequences against those who exploit aquafarmers by spreading false information.


Speaking to reporters here on Monday, the minister said the government has already directed district collectors and SPs to not prevent vehicles carrying aqua products to the nearest ports. He said the poultry sector has been badly hit only due to misinformation. “Experts have already clarified that coronavirus cannot be trasmitted by eating chicken or fish. But the apprehensions over the issue has already crippled the poultry sector in the state and it is high time to protect the aqua farmers,” said Ramanarao.

He said the government is taking all measures to help aqua farmers — providing seed, feed and smooth transportation. The minister explained that marine exports resumed to European countries about 10 days ago after a brief recess and that they would take measures to ramp up the exports in the coming days, as AP is one of the leading exporters of marine products to the world.
