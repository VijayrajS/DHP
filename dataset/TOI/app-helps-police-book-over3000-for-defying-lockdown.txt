Andhra Pradesh: App helps police book over 3,000 for defying lockdown
2020-04-25
VIJAYAWADA: DGP D Gautam Sawang on Friday said as many as 22,478 foreign returnees’ were under surveillance during the lockdown with the help of their indigenously developed Covid Alerting Tracking System or Home Quarantine application. 


Sawang explained that with the help of geofencing capabilities embedded in the application, they were able to book 3,043 persons for violating the lockdown in the last 28 days. 

The app was created by Anantapur DIG Kranthi Rana Tata and DIG (law and order, coordination) SV Raja Shekar. Foreign returnees were made to download and register the application in their phones. “Most of the people with foreign travel history are from Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts. Restrictions have been lifted on those who have completed the quarantine period,” Sawang stated. 

Officials explained that the application uses the cell towers to track a person’s movement. If the person travelled beyond 100 metres of the geofenced area, an alert would be sent to the police, who would, in turn, send teams to arrest the person for violating lockdown restrictions under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. 

Cops are, now, looking to expand the ambit of the application across all identified red zones.

All the district police units across the state have been instructed to send the particulars of all foreign returnees to the DGP’s dashboard.
