2020-02-10
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has written to Chinese President Xi Jinping expressing solidarity with China over the coronavirus outbreak and also offering assistance in facing the challenge from the epidemic which has already killed more than 800. 


The PM offered condolences at the loss of lives due to the outbreak, government officials said, and also conveyed appreciation for facilitating evacuation of Indian citizens from Hubei province. Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong had briefed foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday about Chinese efforts to deal with the crisis. 

Sun had sought a meeting with Shringla immediately after the latter took over as foreign secretary last month. “Received condolence letter from Indian PM Narendra Modi to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding nCoV outbreak in China. Appreciate friendly message and kind support by Indian government. Look forward to further cooperation and confident the epidemic will be brought to an end soon,” the Chinese ambassador tweeted. 

Significantly, as Modi wrote to Xi, the government also removed surgical masks and gloves from the list of banned export items. After the coronavirus outbreak, the government had banned export of protective gear used to ensure safety from airborne diseases. 

India has also assured China that there was no ban on travel to India for Chinese or other foreigners based in mainland China and anyone wanting to travel to India only has to apply afresh for a new visa.
