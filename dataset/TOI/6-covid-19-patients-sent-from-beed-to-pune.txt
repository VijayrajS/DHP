Aurangabad: The Beed district administration seems to be unprepared in the face of Covid-19 outbreak as six patients were sent to Pune because they were not comfortable at the civil hospital and wanted to be admitted to a private hospital. 

District civil surgeon, Beed, Ashok Thorat said, “The patients did not feel comfortable taking treatment at the district civil hospital. There are no private hospitals in Beed. So, on their insistence, they were sent to Pune where they are being treated at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital.” 

On May 17, the first two Covid-19 cases in Beed district emerged from Hivra in Majalgaon and Itkur in Gevrai. Nine more Covid-19 cases were reported the next day, which included seven people—all natives of Pimpalgaon in Ahmednagar—who travelled from Mumbai and tested positive for the infection in Ashti taluka in Beed. A 65-year-old woman, who was part of the group, succumbed to the infection on May 18. All of them were being treated at the district civil hospital in Beed. 

The district civil hospital sent the six Covid-19 patients from Ashti to Pune on Monday. Currently, there are four active Covid-19 cases in Beed. 

Meanwhile, the doctors posted at the Covid ward in Beed district civil hospital struck work on Tuesday morning demanding good quality PPE kits and accommodation with sanitation and food. 

Thorat said that the hospital had adequate PPE kits and a hostel, along with food provisions, was allocated for the doctors serving the Covid-19 patients.
