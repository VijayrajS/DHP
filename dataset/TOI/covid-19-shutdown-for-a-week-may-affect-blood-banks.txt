2020-03-16
MANGALURU: The department of immunohematology and blood transfusion, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, encouraged its staff to donate blood on Saturday, fearing a shortage of blood in the coming days. About 30 staff members participated in this drive. With the weeklong shutdown declared by the state government, and blood donation camps being called off, there are fears that there will be a shortage of blood at the blood bank at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal.

Dr Shamee Shastry, professor and HoD, said, “After the Covid-19 outbreak and a weeklong shutdown declared by the government, blood donation camps have been cancelled. On an average there is a demand for 100 units of different components of blood. 

 
 
The Covid-19 outbreak does not mean that there is a reduction in road accidents, or oncology cases or cases of excessive bleeding during deliveries. People are hesitant to come to the blood bank and donate blood. The major supply to blood banks comes from blood donation camps,” she said. 

She asserted that the blood bank is a safe place, and all precautionary measures to tackle Covid-19, including placing hand sanitizers, are in place. Requesting healthy people to donate blood, Dr Shamee said, “Our current stock is sufficient for the next two days.” Whenever, there is a blood donation drive about 100-150 donors participate. 

No shortage of blood in Mangaluru

Dr Sharath Kumar, senior specialist, Regional Centre of Excellence, Blood Transfusion Centre, Wenlock Hospital, said that they are not facing any shortage of blood and that blood donation camps are taking place as per schedule. There is sufficient blood in our bank. 

“Shortage is generally seen when colleges are closed for two months during summer. We are already working to ensure that there is no shortage during this season,” he said.
