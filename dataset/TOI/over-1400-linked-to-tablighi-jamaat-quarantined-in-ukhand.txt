Dehradun: As many as 1,436 people from Uttarakhand, who are linked to Tablighi Jamaat, have been quarantined since the last week of March, according to police.

Of these, 895 have been institutional quarantined while rest 540 are in home quarantine, said Ashok Kumar, director general (DG) law and order, adding, “About 80% of the total jamaatis have been tested while tests of nearly 20% are awaited.”

Incidentally, the state governments across the country, including Uttarakhand, have been on tenterhooks since the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz turned out to be the hotbed of COVID-19 outbreak in the country.

In Uttarakhand, police have booked eight members of Tablighi Jamaat under section 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for not showing up before police and hiding their participation in jamaat.
