‘Lockdown Bird Challenge’ amid Covid-19 crisis
2020-03-27
Aurangabad: While the country is under lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, an expert group — Bird Count India — has come up with an initiative to turn the situation into a positive contribution by recording the winged creatures around homes.

Known for supporting, listing and monitoring of birds in a scientific manner, the group has announced ‘Lockdown Bird Challenge’ from Friday till the restrictions are lifted. 

“Do you see bird species you haven’t recorded before? Which species are found where in your city? What is the behaviour of the birds you see? You can contribute to answering these questions and more through the Lockdown Birding Challenge,” a release said.

As part of the initiative, amateurs, as well as experts, are expected to look for birds for 15 minutes, standing at the same place during different time slots such as 4 am-6 am (optional), 6 am -9 am (at least one list), 4 am to 7 pm (at least one list), 7 pm-10 pm (optional).

The purpose of the pre-dawn and the night lists are to document early-rising birds and nocturnal species respectively.

The lists of bird spotted can be uploaded on eBird platform (ebird.org/india). The eBird mobile app is one of the easiest ways to upload sightings.

“As with our other birding challenges, all those who manage to meet the target will be named on our website, and one among them will be chosen at random to receive a small gift in appreciation. Participants must ensure that they adhere to all instructions by central and local authorities while birding,” organisers said.
