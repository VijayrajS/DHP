Covid-19 in Rajasthan: ‘Quarantine anti-CAA protesters’
2020-03-19
KOTA: BJP MLA from Ramganjmandi Madan Dilawar has urged CM Ashok Gehlot to quarantine anti-CAA demonstrators by erecting four high walls/ barricades around the places of protest if they do not agree to abide by the request of vacating places of protest. He has asked Gehlot to also shut down meat shops. He hailed state govt for taking measures to contain coronvirus. 


Dilawar appreciated the state Congress government’s efforts and measures so far put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The MLA has written to the chief minister in this regard.

Drawing chief minister’s attention to people who have been staging ‘dharna’ in protest against Citizen Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) for long time at various places in the state, the BJP MLA asked the chief minister to request the protesters to immediately vacate the places of protest and to move to their respective homes.

“If the protesters are not agreed to request of vacating the places of protest, allow them to sit for the protest in as many numbers as they want but all of them should be quarantined by electing high walls/ barricades around the places of protest and none of them from inside and people from outside be allowed to move to and fro into the places of protest,” the BJP MLA wrote to the CM.
