Nashik: The Dhule-based Shri Bhausaheb Hire Government Medical College & Hospital (SBHGMCH) has decided to add 30 more oxygen points at the 206-bed Covid-19 ward of the hospital.The ward has been set up in a separate building within the SBHGMCH premises.Hospital superintendent Ramkumar Suryavanshi said that work to set up 30 more oxygen points at the Covid-29 ward has already begun. At present, there are 33 oxygen points in the ward. With the new addition, there will be 63 oxygen points in the ward.The oxygen points are located above the beds. In case a patient needs it, they are provided with oxygen using these points which are connected to the main central pipe supplying it.“Our experience in treating Covid-19 patients have shown that patients who have moderate infection do not need ventilator support in Intensive Care Unit. Their condition can be stabilised if they are provided with oxygen at their beds. Hence, we have increased the oxygen points at the beds of the wards,” said hospital authorities.According to Dr Surayanshi, the work of setting up of additional oxygen points would be completed within the next 10 days.SBHGMCH sources said that oxygen is required to for Covid-19 patients who have pre-existing health disorders like problem in lungs, diabetes, etc. And, due to the infection, the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells of such patients is reduced, making them depend on oxygen points or cylinders.“However, such patients need not be put on ventilators at ICU. Such patients are given oxygen from the oxygen points which helps in maintaining the oxygen saturation levels of patients,” said hospital sources.According to hospital sources, the increase of oxygen points at the Covid ward would also help in case there is a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in Dhule or in the neighbouring districts.
