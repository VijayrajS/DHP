Coronavirus: Didi against trains entering West Bengal
2020-03-22
KOLKATA: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has called for an immediate stop to inter-state trains entering Bengal as there is no mechanism on trains to screen passengers for coronavirus infection. 


Banerjee instructed state chief secretary to get in touch with railway officials after getting news of two special trains bringing home thousands of migrants working in Maharashtra, the most severely affected state in the country. 

“Why can’t these states take responsibility for these people’s health when they make them work? But they (railways) are not listening. We will not allow (inter-state) trains to enter the state if they (railways) keep sending them here” the CM said. 

“All three positive cases here are people who have come from abroad. Some of them landed elsewhere in the country and then reached Kolkata. Railways does not have any screening mechanism in place,” she said.
