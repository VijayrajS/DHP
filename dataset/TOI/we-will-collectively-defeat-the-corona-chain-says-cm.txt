BHOPAL: With a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in Indore, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said a total lockdown would be imposed in the district to prevent spread of the deadly virus.


 “Indore is the city of dreams and due to awareness of the residents, it has consistently been ranked the cleanest city in the country thrice. But, now it is fighting the Covid-19 outbreak. We have to defeat it at any cost. Follow the Laxman Rekha advised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break the chain,” said Chouhan in a video circulated through his Twitter on Tuesday.

 Chouhan further said, “I know you are festival lovers but, can't you stay at home or in isolation for the sake of your family. I urge you, we will be strict and impose a total lockdown. Those who are detected positive they will be treated and their family members be quarantined. I apologize for the inconvenience but, we are taking strict action for your good, for Indore. Please cooperate. If you face any problem, forgive us. We will collectively defeat coronavirus.” 

 Chouhan in his appeal said, “When the entire country is fighting Covid-19, some people are not taking the lockdown seriously and are still flouting the rules. Going outside could be dangerous for oneself and the family too so, stay at home. Break the chain of social contact. The administration is trying to provide essential commodities to residents at home. Yes, there are positive cases, but this doesn’t mean it can’t be treated. Some people got cured in Jabalpur.” 

 The CM also called on Governor Lalji Tandon at Raj Bhavan and briefed him about measures taken by the state government to control the outbreak. Earlier, during the day, he also spoke to social workers and government staff engaged in emergency service and thanked them for their service during these testing times.
