2020-05-19
Hubballi: A 12-year-old was among the five individuals who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Gadag on Monday, pushing the district’s tally of active cases 11. 

Gadag deputy commissioner MG Hiremath said that, among the five people who were confirmed infected, was a 30-year-old man, who had travelled from Chennai to Shirahatti in the district. “He entered Gadag on May 12, along with 16 others. However, his fellow travellers have all tested negative for the infection,” Hiremath said. 

The four other individuals, including the 12-year-old child, are residents of localities around Ganji Basaveshwara Circle, which had been under containment after a local had tested positive more than a month ago. All four individuals reportedly contracted the novel coronavirus from previously infected patients.

The man who had returned to Shirahatti had been placed in institutional quarantine immediately after his arrival from Chennai, Hiremath added. “He has now been admitted to the Gadag Institute of Medical Sciences. We have also sent throat swab samples of primary and secondary contacts of the four others who have been confirmed infected on Monday. We are contemplating the possibility of quarantining all residents of localities around Ganji Basaveshwara Circle in our facilities,” the DC said. 

Citing the success that the district administration had in Rangwanwada, where all residents were shifted to the quarantine centre, Hiremath said, “Soon, the entire area was free of Covid-19.” 

On the other hand, five people have recovered from the infection and have been discharged from GIMS in the district so far.
