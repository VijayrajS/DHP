New home quarantine guideline to be implemented in Shahuwadi-Panhala
2020-05-19
Kolhapur: Migrants returning to their villages in the Shahuwadi-Panhala taluka from red-zone areas have been asked to quarantine themselves at their own homes, while their family members (the ones who had stayed back in the village) will have to move in with the neighbours or other relatives for 14 days. The aim is to reduce pressure on the available institutional quarantine facilities.

After getting the new home-quarantine guidelines from the state, the district administration is going to implement it in the Shahuwadi-Panhala taluka, said a media brief from the district information office. It added that MP Dhairyashil Mane has advised creating a new ‘Kolhapur pattern’ of home quarantine. tnn
