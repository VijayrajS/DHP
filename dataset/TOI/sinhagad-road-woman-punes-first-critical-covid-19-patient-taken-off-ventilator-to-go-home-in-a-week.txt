PUNE: The first critical novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infected patient in Pune has recovered and will go home in a week's time. 

The 42-year-old woman from Sinhagad Road, with no history of foreign travel, was put off the ventilator after 11 days of aggressive treatment at a private hospital in Pune on Tuesday. Her throat swab sample has tested negative twice in 24 hours for the contagion.

"She is breathing on her own. She also had some soup in the morning. We will discharge her in a week. She is perhaps the first patient who was critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome and has recovered successfully. Her recovery has given us hope that seriously ill patients can come out of complications," Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Hospital told TOI.

The woman was being treated at the hospital since March 16 and her condition worsened three days later. She was then intubated and put on ventilator support on March 20. The hospital sent her throat swab sample to rule out swine flu, but it tested positive for Covid-19 and negative for swine flu.

"We administered her aggressive treatment on ventilator support. We used all medication, including antiviral drugs, meant for the treatment of swine flu, malaria and HIV. Skilled intensivists and round-the-clock ICU nursing pulled her off the critical ARDS state which is a fatal complication of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses," Lalwani said.
