AGRA: A hotel owner was booked by Sikandra police in Agra for re-opening booking facility, which has been currently barred by the government in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The incident took place on Saturday. 


Arvind Kumar, SHO of Sikandra police station, said, “A tip-off was shared about a couple being allowed to book a hotel. Since the lockdown is still valid, no hotel can be open for bookings. The hotel owner has been charged under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and the Epidemic Act, whereas the couple were let off after their identity verification.”
