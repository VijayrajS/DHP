Hubballi: As was the case with all government departments and functions, priorities of India Post too have changed drastically following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country – from delivery of mail, and managing its diverse financial portfolio, the world’s purportedly largest postal network has been occupied with the delivery of medicines, testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) across India. 

Over 20,000 postmen travelled to places in the corners of Karnataka to ensure supply of essentials and medicines. 

Chief postmaster general, Bengaluru Charles Lobo said that the department delivered a staggering 19,000 parcels containing medicines during the lockdown. “Our staff delivered medicines and other such essential commodities to the doorstep of the people. We took all necessary precautions in handling of the parcels, and ensured on-time delivery. Since all parcels are sealed, we are not aware of what medicines are being delivered,” said Lobo. 

Among the medicines that were delivered to patients across the country were drugs for tuberculosis, cancer, arthritis and such longstanding disorders. Assistant superintendent of post offices, Dharwad division Iranna Mutnali confirmed that nearly eight tonnes of medicines, mostly comprising drugs for TB were sent from across the division. He said that, given the weight of the parcel, which came up to eight tonnes, the department realised that the package contained drugs for TB. 

“Our division covers 13 districts, and we ensured that all medicines reached their respective destination within three days,” he added.
