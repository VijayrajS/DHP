Mumbai: Elective operations put on hold as private doctors can’t prescribe Covid-19 tests
2020-05-09
MUMBAI: The change in the Covid-19 testing protocol announced late on Thursday, which proved to be the last and yet another controversial decision of shunted municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi, disrupted medical services on Friday. 

Several elective surgeries had to be put on hold as private doctors were told by laboratories that they were not authorised to write the tests, triggering complaints about handling emergencies and how it could push people to further delay necessary treatments.

The new rule, as reported by TOI in its Friday edition, said a suspected patient would have to come to a BMC quarantine centre to give the swab sample and stay there till the test results are out. Moreover, tests could be conducted only if the prescription is routed through the BMC’s medical health officer. However, the instructions that began going out from ward officers on Friday said tests prescribed by private doctors will be honoured for pregnant women, dialysis and cancer patients, and those with co-morbidities.
