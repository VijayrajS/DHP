Ahmedabad: A city sessions court on Thursday denied bail to two persons accused of throwing stones at policemen who were enforcing lockdown in Gomtipur area on April 1.

Gomtipur police had booked 16 persons for rioting by targeting a police party, which tried to enforce lockdown in the area. In all, five persons had been arrested and two of them sought bail claiming innocence. They claimed that the incident of stone pelting had taken place because police stopped some people from going to a PDS shop to collect free grain, the accused submitted.

However, public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt argued that the accused persons were out in public place in violation of orders issued for the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The accused had defied police orders and pelted stones at the police party injuring a policeman in his head.

After hearing the bail pleas, the court said that it appeared that while police were patrolling the area to enforce lockdown, some 20 persons got together and violated the norms of the lockdown and the public notification. They did not return to their places despite police warning. The court reasoned it is not proper to grant bail to them or else they would repeat the offence.
