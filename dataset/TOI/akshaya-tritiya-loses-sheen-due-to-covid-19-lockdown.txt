2020-04-27
Coimbatore: Akshaya Tritiya, which fell on Sunday, was a lukewarm and an online affair for city residents.Usually, people would throng jewellery shops to buy gold, due to the belief that purchasing gold on the day would bring in wealth multifold. But, with complete lockdown in force, jewellery shops shut and people unable to leave the confinement of their homes, that was not the case on Sunday.Some jewellers had opened online sales portals, where people can order jewels on Sunday and it would be delivered when the lockdown is lifted. Jewellers said while big corporate jewellers had provided customers with online purchasing option, small ones too had caught up. B Sabarinath, president of Coimbatore Jewellers Association said small jewelleries too had opened online sales on Sunday. “Some small jewelleries reached out to their customers through WhatsApp and messages, using their customer database,” he said.However, the overall exercise did not evoke the desired response, he said. “The sales were very meagre. It was just around 2%-3% of what we had in previous years,” he said.This was because of people’s mindset, said S M Kamal Hasan, president of Coimbatore Goldsmiths’ Association. “Our people would want to go to shops and buy gold in person. Even if they want to buy gold on an auspicious occasion, they would want to visit shops. So, the online business did not evoke much response,” he said.He said the craze over Akshaya Tritiya was just a decade-old trend. “Before that, on the day people used to buy provisions such as salt and turmeric, which symbolized prosperity. But, a decade ago, some popular astrologers campaigned for buying gold on the day and that was how the trend came to be,” he said.
