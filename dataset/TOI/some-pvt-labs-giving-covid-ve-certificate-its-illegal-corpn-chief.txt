Some private labs giving Covid-19 negative certificate, it’s illegal: Chennai corporation chief
2020-06-05
CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash on Thursday hinted at a scam in the city, involving private labs and agents luring people who were being asked to produce Covid-19 negative certificates by employers for returning to work.

In response to a question asked by a reporter, Prakash said this was patently illegal and that they had come to know about it. “I don’t want to name them, but some private labs are doing this using agents. Some private hospitals are also involved. We will be taking action,” he said. Prakash said as far as testing was concerned, state government and Centre’s norms were to be followed.

Prakash said anybody who has recovered from Covid-19 can go to work and that there was no need for such a certificate to be provided, as per existing labour laws. “Though we have said it earlier, it shall be reiterated with a circular and a clarification,” he said.

It was a wrong practice to insist or compel people cured of Covid-19 to provide such certificates, he said.
