2020-04-20
Madurai: Many teachers and principals from various government, government-aided and private schools across the district are actively reaching out to their pupils through phone calls or WhatsApp. The teachers are trying to engage the children, create awareness about COVID-19 and generally cheer them up.

One of the teachers from Y Othakadai Government Primary School, Moses said, “We have a WhatsApp group and we encourage students to participate in creative activity and competitions online. Every class teacher is also talking to their students and parents over phone and sharing how they are spending their time.” Several other government school teachers are also following similar ways to bond with their students despite lockdown.

With Class X students likely to write their board exams post lockdown, many schools are following up and engaging with such students so they don’t get laidback due to the prevailing uncertainty. “Teachers are always open to clearing doubts and we had given our contact numbers to all students. However, while some students voluntarily seek help to study, some don’t come forward unless you push them so it has become a necessity to reach out to students. Sometimes, such calls can bring a smile to your face when students start enthusiastically talking about their time at home or discuss what’s happening in lockdown,” said Ramesh C, a Class X science teacher.

At Al-Ameen Higher Secondary School, K Pudur, which has strength of 700 students, all teachers have been calling up every single one of them to check in on them. “We wanted teachers to encourage students to study and be productive during this lockdown. We also wanted to create awareness about COVID-19 and ask students to follow all preventive measures. Apart from that, such calls can spread positivity that teachers care so much,” said S Sheikh Nabi, the school headmaster.
