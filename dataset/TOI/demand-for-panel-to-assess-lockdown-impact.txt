Demand for panel to assess lockdown impact
2020-05-11
Trichy: A day after Tamil Nadu government formed an expert committee to suggest the way forward for the state to come out of the lockdown, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have sought a similar expert committee to assess the impact on the sector.

Small scale entrepreneurs said that MSMEs were not represented in the expert committee constituted under former RBI governor C Rangarajan.

Stating that MSMEs will face a turbulent period even if the lockdown is lifted, MSME associations sought for a discussion with policymakers on remedial measures.

“Employer’s contribution to Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) in MSME sector can be borne by the government. Such suggestions can be made only if we have a representation in the expert committee,” said R Ilango, president of Tiruchirapalli District Tiny & Small Scale Industries (Tiditssia).

There are over 2,000 MSMEs in the district employing at least 1 lakh workers in various sectors including grill gate production, woodwork, food production and engineering. As the functioning and requirements of MSMEs differ from large-scale industries, entrepreneurs pitched for an exclusive expert committee comprising members from Tamil Nadu Small and Tiny Industries Association.

“MSME associations in districts should be consulted by the authorities to hear our woes and demands,” said N Kanagasabapathy, former president of Tisitssia. Though a few MSMEs resumed operation through the relaxation provided during the ongoing lockdown, entrepreneurs still face a daunting task ahead such as bringing employees to workplace and gathering raw materials.
