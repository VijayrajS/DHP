Kolhapur: Sangli district recorded two new Covid-19 patients, taking the total number to nine. While one patient is from Sangli city, another is from a village in Jaat taluka. Both the patients are said to have returned from Mumbai.

According to official information released by the district administration, a resident of Revenue Colony from Sangli city tested positive for Covid-19. His throat swab sample was sent for testing on Wednesday. The district administration has taken a serious cognizance of the incident as the said person had returned from Mumbai last week in violation to the lockdown and inter-state travel norms laid down by the government. 

The second Covid-19 positive patient from Ankle village in Jaat taluka, too, returned from Mumbai without any official permission. His throat swab sample was sent for testing, the report of which was received on Thursday.

The administration is planning to initiate legal action against both the individuals as they had entered the district illegally. 

Officials said that the Covid-19 patient from Ankle village had come from Chembur in Mumbai by a truck. Initial inquiry revealed that he alighted from the truck at Nagaj phata and walked down to the village. However, some local residents noticed him and alerted the authorities. The administration is now on the lookout for all those who had come in contact with him during the journey. 

Meanwhile, district collector Abhijit Chaudhary said that he would review the relaxation terms in Sangli city after ensuring that people are following social distancing at all times. Chaudhary said that he would talk to associations of traders and shopkeepers before making a decision.
