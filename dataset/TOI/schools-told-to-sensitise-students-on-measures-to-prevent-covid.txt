2020-02-14
Hyderabad: The Telangana State Council of Educational Research and Training (TSCERT) has issued a notice to all schools to sensitise students about public health measures to prevent spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). The move comes following orders from the Union health ministry to spread awareness among students about preventive interventions.

“Frequent hand wash, respiratory etiquettes (using handkerchief over mouth while coughing, sneezing...)staying away from school when sick...will help in preventing/reducing transmission of not only this disease but also large number of other communicable diseases...,” reads the notice issued to over 40,000 schools in the state.

The TSCERT has also distributed pamphlets in schools and other teacher training institutions to follow simple public health measures to prevent spread of novel Coronavirus and other communicable diseases. “As of now, there is no drug or vaccine available to manage this disease. Hence, preventive measures become crucial to stop spread of this disease,” stated the notice.
