AMARAVATI: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed the health department to equip the YSR Telemedicine programme to attend all non-coronavirus related ailments and non-emergencies. 


During a meeting with senior officials at his camp office on Friday, the chief minister directed them to ensure that medicines were being provided to patients within 24 hours of consultation with doctors from the telemedicine command control room. He also instructed the health department to procure bikes and thermo bags for doorstep delivery of medicines. 

“YSR Telemedicine should be able to address most minor ailments so that people do not have to go to PHCs or district hospitals,” he said, adding that setting up of village clinics should also be the health department’s priority for the next few months. 

The CM also took stock of the Covid-19 containment measures and told the officials to submit data of complaints received so far to assess public needs.

He enquired about the preparedness of the administration to handle the rush of migrants and foreign returnees in the next few days and said that there should not be any compromise with regard to providing quarantine facilities.
