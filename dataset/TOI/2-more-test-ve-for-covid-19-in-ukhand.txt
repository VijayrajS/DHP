Dehradun:　Two more Covid-19-positive cases were reported from Udham Singh (US) Nagar district on Thursday, taking the state’s tally to 57.

According to the health department, both the Covid-19 patients from US Nagar were shifted to Dr Susheela Tiwari Medical College, Haldwani. Both the positive cases are natives of Almora and were coming back to their village from Maharashtra.

US Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Shailja Bhatt told TOI that the two positive cases had travelled in various vehicles to reach Uttarakhand from Maharashtra. “A total of five people were caught by police on the border of US Nagar and they were admitted to a hospital here. They all were asymptomatic but we took their samples and two of them turned out to be positive," she added.

Meanwhile, to augment Covid-19 testing in the hills, CM Trivendra Rawat on Thursday inaugurated a testing facility at Vir Chandra Singh Garhwali Government Institute of Medical Science and Research in Srinagar.

At the inauguration of the testing lab, CM Rawat said, "This will be the fourth testing lab in Uttarakhand with a maximum capacity to test 100 samples per day."

In another development, Bahadrabad police in Haridwar on Thursday nabbed eight Jamaatis for allegedly hiding their travel history. Cases are yet to be registered against them and they have been admitted to a private medical college in Roorkee for observation.
