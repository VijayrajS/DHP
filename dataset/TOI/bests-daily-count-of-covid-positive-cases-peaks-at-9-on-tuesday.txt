MUMBAI: Nine BEST staffers tested positive for corona virus on Tuesday-the highest score for a day so far, taking the total number of positive cases to 49. Of the new cases, six are drivers and conductors, two from the power supply division and one is a bus maintenance staffer. 

Two other employees recovered and were discharged from hospital on Tuesday, officials said. 

The BEST has fitted seven buses of its fleet with a curtain partition on buses to separate commuters on board from its driver and conductor. A plastic sheet serving as a division has been put up in these buses such that the driver and conductor will be in the front portion. 

Three other BEST employees have succumbed. In all, 35 patients are now "active", of whom 12 have been currently quarantined.
