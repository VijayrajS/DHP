Plant quarantine licence boost for Kial
2020-05-10
Kannur: After Covid-19 cast a shadow over the revenue of recently-opened Kannur international airport (Kial), authorities are trying to generate revenue through cargo exports as Kial received plant quarantine licence, which is a major step for the export of fruits, vegetables and other perishables.

A few days ago, the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare issued a gazette notification in this connection and this is a major achievement because export of perishable cargo like fruits and vegetable requires this licence, said Kial MD V Thulasidas.

"With this notification, Kial has crossed a major milestone towards export of fruits and vegetables, which are expected to be main cargo from Kannur and surrounding areas. The next step is custom clearance which is expected very soon," he said.

Amid concerns about passenger traffic to the Gulf after Covid-19ends, export will be a source of revenue said Kial authorities.

The work of two cargo complexes are going on at the airport and one with 1,200 sq m area is almost ready for operations. An examination by bureau of civil aviation security (BCAS) and Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) are over and with custom clearance it would become fully operational. The work of 1.05L sq ft cargo complex is going on and once this is ready, the smaller one could be used for domestic cargo.

Apart from Kannur and Wayanad, the facility would help cargo exports from Coorg and Mysuru, which is likely to boost agri sector as well. Since many small-time farmers are involved in different kinds of farming in Kerala and Coorg, it will help them export their products and help entrepreneurship in the field of food parks, said people in the field.

However, in order to boost exports, more flights, especially wide-bodied aircraft should be operating from here. But that requires permission for foreign carriers to begin operations from here because most Indian carriers, except Air India, do not have wide-bodied aircraft.
