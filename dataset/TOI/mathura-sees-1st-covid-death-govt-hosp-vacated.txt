2020-04-29
Agra: Mathura administration vacated the government-run District Combined Hospital in Vrindavan after the sample of a 50-year-old suspected Covid-19 positive woman, who died in the hospital on Monday night, tested positive on Tuesday.

While this was the first Covid-related death in the district, a ward boy of the same hospital tested positive for the infection, taking the total tally of such cases in the district to 13. The ward boy was admitted to a hospital and eight of his family members, including four minor children, were quarantined later. 

Around 90 staff members, including 11 doctors of the District Combined Hospital have also been quarantined in the hospital to contain possibilities of the spread of the infection. “Samples are being taken for testing and will be sent to Aligarh,” said Mathura district magistrate Sarvagya Ram Mishra.

He told TOI that four patients who were undergoing treatment in the hospital had been shifted to KD Hospital for treatment, as all doctors and staff members of the government hospital were quarantined. He said that the woman, who died, was admitted in a separate ward and had not come in contact with other patients, except that they too were being attended by the same staff. 

According to health officials, the woman was initially shifted to the quarantine centre in Vrindavan after her two brothers-in-law tested positive for Covid-19. When her condition started deteriorating, she was shifted to the District Combined Hospital, where she died on Monday night. She was suffering from diabetes too. 

Her family member, however, alleged negligence and circulated a video of patient complaining of improper treatment.
