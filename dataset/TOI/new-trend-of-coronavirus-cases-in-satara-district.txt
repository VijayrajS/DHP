KOLHAPUR: Satara district administration authorities have noticed a new trend of Covid-19 cases in which one member of a family tests positive for the contagion followed by other members of the same family.

This trend has been witnessed in a number of families across the district, especially in remote villages in tehsils such as Satara, Khataw, Patan and Phaltan. Authorities have said that at least one member of such families have travel history to Mumbai. 

Authorities have warned that the number of Covid-19 cases may rise in the future if the continuous influx of people from cities like Mumbai keeps happening. 

Four members of a family tested positive for coronavirus in Sastewadi village of Phaltan tehsil on Thursday. A male member of the family had a travel history to Mumbai. He tested positive for the contagion. Soon after, his wife and 21-year-old daughter, who were high-risk contacts, tested positive. Another woman of the same family too tested positive for coronavirus later. 

In a similar case, a 54-year-old man from Jambhli village of Wai tehsil tested positive for Covid-19. He, along with a few others, had returned from Mumbai on May 5. The man, who was facing some health issues at the time of travel, passed away after returning to his village. His swab samples were taken and sent for testing, the reports of which confirmed that he died of Covid-19. Later, local authorities traced people who were in touch with him. Seven members of his family tested positive for the contagion.
