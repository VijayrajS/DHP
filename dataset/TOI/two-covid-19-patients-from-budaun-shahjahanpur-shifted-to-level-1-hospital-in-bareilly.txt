BAREILLY: Two Covid-19 positive patients from Budaun and Shahjahanpur have been shifted to the community health centre (CHC) in Bithri Chainpur, which has been designated as Bareilly’s level 1 hospital. Officials said two teams, each comprising 25 members, have been constituted for their treatment. When one team will be on duty for eight hours, the other will be quarantined at a hotel.

Additional director (health), Bareilly division, Dr Rakesh Dubey said, “The CHC in Bithri Chainpur has been designated as a level-1 hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, while serious patients of novel coronavirus will be treated at level 2 and 3 hospitals. We have designated two private medical colleges in Bareilly as level 2 and 3 hospitals.”

Officials said as per the directions of the higher authorities, if a district recorded one or two cases, then the patients would be shifted to a division-level government hospital, but if a district reported a higher number of patients, then they would be treated there. Hence, one patient each from Budaun and Shahjahanpur was shifted to the CHC in Bareilly.

Chief medical officer Dr Vineet Shukla said, “We have set up two teams comprising 25 members each. A team has doctors, nurses, ward boys and sweepers. When one team will be on duty, another team will be quarantined at the hotel. Members of both teams will be actively quarantined at the hotel and they will not be allowed to go home as a precautionary measure.”

Besides, a third team is treating Covid-19 patients at the district hospital. Six people belonging to a family are undergoing treatment here.
