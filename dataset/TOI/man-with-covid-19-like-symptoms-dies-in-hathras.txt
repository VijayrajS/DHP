Agra: A 32-year-old man, who was admitted to Hathras district hospital’s isolation ward on Sunday with Covid-19-like symptoms, died on Monday morning. His sample was sent for testing to Aligarh’s Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and the report is still awaited. 

Confirming this, Hathras DM Praveen Kumar Laxkar said the man, who hailed from Hathras’s Nayabans, was admitted to the district hospital on Sunday after his condition started to deteriorate. He breathed his last at 11am on Monday.

The DM told TOI that the man was admitted at an isolation ward since he had a history of Cerebral meningitis, for which he was being treated, till recently, at Agra’s Paras hospital where several patients had been found positive for Covid-19. The said hospital was sealed by the administration on April 6. 

The DM added it is still not certain, whether the deceased was infected with Covid-19, but as a precautionary measure his body was "sanitised" before being sent to a mortuary. Also, samples of two persons, who came along with him, were taken for testing. 

Chief medical officer Dr Brijesh Rathore said that the deceased was admitted to Paras hospital on March 26 and returned to Hathras on April 4 after being treated for brain infection. As his name was mentioned in the list of people, who were being traced, he was admitted to the Covid-19 ward.
