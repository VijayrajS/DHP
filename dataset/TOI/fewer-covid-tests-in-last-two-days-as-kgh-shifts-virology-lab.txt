2020-05-15
VISAKHAPATNAM: Many people were pleasantly surprised, while others expressed doubts over coronavirus (Covid-19) testing as the district reported no new case between Tuesday and Thursday noon. However, five new cases were reported in the district once testing resumed on Thursday evening taking Vizag’s tally to 71. No official announcement has been made in this regard so far.

Health officials clarified that fewer tests were conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday as the virology laboratory was being shifted to the newly-constructed premises at King George Hospital (KGH). Though TrueNat beta tests were being conducted, RT-PCR tests were stopped for two days.

Speaking to TOI, Dr P V Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College (AMC) and a member of district covid control committee said, “Usually, 900-1,000 Covid-19 tests are conducted daily. But we could conduct only around 50% tests on Tuesday and Wednesday as the virology laboratory was being shifted from near the Rajendranagar ward to a building behind the diet canteen near the entrance gate. The central government had given Rs 50 lakh, which was used for reconstruction and renovation of the building to house the virology lab, away from other hospital wards. Two more RT-PCR machines have also been added and now we have four such machines.”

“TrueNat tests were conducted daily and on Wednesday evening around 300 samples tested negative,” Dr Sudhakar added.
