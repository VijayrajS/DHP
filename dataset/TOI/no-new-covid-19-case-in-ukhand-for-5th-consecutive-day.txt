Dehradun: No new case of novel coronavirus was reported in Uttarakhand for the fifth consecutive day on Monday. Director of national health mission (NHM), Uttarakhand, Yugal Kishore Pant said that the health department has received reports of 125 samples from the virology labs of Susheela Tiwari Medical College and AIIMS Rishikesh, the two main Covid-19 testing centres, and all were negative. “We had sent 131 samples for testing on April 13 and results of 191 samples were pending till Monday. The state has done 1998 tests of Covid-19 till now. It is a good news that we haven’t got a single positive case in past five days but people are still advised to stay indoors as that will minimise the risk for them,” he said, adding that 325 new ICU beds are also ready in various government establishments apart from the already existing ones.

Meanwhile, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat also said that it is heartening that not a single Covid-19-positive case has been found in the state in the past 100 hours. “As many as seven cases have been treated and discharged and another two or three more are likely to follow suit in the next few days. The situation is under control. However, we still cannot drop our guard. There have been instances where symptoms have been visible even after 30 days,” the CM said.

The health department also announced that Doon Hospital, Indian Institute of Petroleum and a private pathology lab, Dr Ahuja’s Pathology Centre have been given in-principle approval to test samples of Covid-19. 

Also, to ensure treatment of patients with deadly diseases, the government has announced pick and drop facility to the patients via 108 ambulance after reports came of people finding it difficult to reach hospitals in the absence of public transport during lockdown.
