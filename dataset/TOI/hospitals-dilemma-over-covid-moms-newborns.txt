Kolkata: Hospital’s dilemma over Covid-19 moms’ newborns
2020-05-08
KOLKATA: Three infants — all girls — born to Covid-19 positive mothers have the authorities of MR Bangur Hospital in a fix — whether to keep the babies with the mothers or discharge them to prevent transmission from their mothers. Eventually, the hospital administration decided to go by the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to let the babies stay so that they could be breastfed.

The country’s top medical research body said that there are no recorded cases of breastmilk testing positive for Covid-19. “Though doctors were divided in their opinion, we decided to let the girls be with their mothers. Breastfeeding is very important for a newborn baby because it will give them the immunity they need to fight any infection,” Partha Guha, acting superintendent of MR Bangur Hospital, told TOI.





Two of the babies are three days old and one is four-day-old. Their mothers tested Covid positive after delivering them at KPC Medical College and Hospital at Jadavpur and were transferred to MR Bangur Hospital on Wednesday.

On Thursday, MR Bangur doctors, recommended that the babies shouldn’t be separated from the mothers. The babies’ swab samples have been sent to check their Covid-19 status.” So, the nursing mothers have masked and sanitized themselves. They are asymptomatic, Guha said, and housed in the women’s isolation ward.

Queene Aditya, a gynaecologist with Narayan Memorial Hospital, said, “The hospital’s predicament is understandable. But the benefits of breastfeeding outweighs any other inherent risk of contagion. Yet, the fear of the baby contacting infection from the mother is always there because physical proximity is part of breastfeeding. Express milk could be an option, but for that, too, the baby needs to be near the mother.”
