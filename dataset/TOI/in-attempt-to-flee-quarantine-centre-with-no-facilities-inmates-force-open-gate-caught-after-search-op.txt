2020-04-29
AGRA: A group of about 12 people in a quarantine centre in Agra forced open the gate of the facility on Tuesday in a desperate bid to escape and allegedly misbehaved with doctors on duty. The district administration has launched a probe into the matter even as a video of the incident was widely circulated on social media.

Officials said there was chaos in the centre located on the National Highway-2 on Tuesday morning when inmates forced open the gate and managed to reach an open field nearby. A search operation was launched as soon as police and district officials reached the centre. The officials said all those who fled were caught and sent to their rooms. Chief development officer (CDO) J Reebha said officials at the quarantine centre assisted in the search.

Officials said one of the inmates snatched a doctor’s phone and others verbally abused them.

The inmates were alleging lack of arrangements at the facility, sources said. On Monday, a video purportedly showing poor and unhygienic conditions at the same quarantine centre had appeared on social media. The district administration had recommended that the state government suspend the block development officer (BDO), in charge of maintenance and operations of the centre. 

The quarantine centre is a private college with the capacity to house 600 people. At present, 117 people have been quarantined there.

District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Those who tried to escape are being identified. Suitable action will be taken against those who misbehaved with the staffers on duty.”

Singh denied that the facility lacked proper arrangements. “Adequate arrangements of food, water and toilets have been made at the centre. Some people quarantined at the centre want to go home, they are the ones causing a disturbance.”
