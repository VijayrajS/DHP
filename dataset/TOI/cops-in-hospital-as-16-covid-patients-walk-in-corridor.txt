2020-05-16
GHAZIABAD: Staff at the District Combined Hospital, a level 2 Covid facility, had a tough time managing 16 positive patients on Friday morning. Officials said the patients kept walking around the corridors and other floors of the hospital despite repeated warnings. The situation could be brought under control only after police threatened to initiate action against them.

With a drastic increase in the number of positive cases in the past two weeks, the health department has started moving Covid patients to the district hospital even if they are asymptomatic. Till Thursday, 16 patients had been admitted to the L2 facility. On Friday morning, all the 16 patients admitted to the hospital walked out of their ward, causing a flutter among the hospital staff and other patients.

Sources said there had been a delay in providing these patients with dinner on Thursday night. The next morning, too, the hospital staff got late in arranging breakfast for them. The patients walked out of their ward and started roaming around the corridor, enquiring about the breakfast. 

Chief medical superintendent Naresh Vij said the cops deployed outside the hospital warned the patients against leaving their isolation ward.
