Gujarat: ‘Targeted testing has helped us avert Covid-19 spread to 18,000’
2020-04-26
GANDHINAGAR: Despite being the state with the second highest number of Covid-19 patients in the country, Gujarat has been able to control the spread of the pandemic in the past 35 days, claimed Ashwani Kumar, secretary to the chief minister.


Kumar stated that the high number of cases also reflected how aggressively the administration had carried out testing in Ahmedabad and Surat to identify and isolate Covid-19 carriers.

“There have been clear instructions from the chief minister that there is nothing to fear about high number of cases, but the sole aim of the administration must be to identify maximum number of patients to control the spread of the pandemic,” said Kumar. 

Kumar said that tests were conducted on 2,707 persons per million population in Ahmedabad, while the tests were carried out on 721 persons per million population in Surat. “This is one of the highest testing figures in the country. Instead of wasting testing capabilities on random tests, the administration has done intensive testing in hotspots. Because of the lockdown and targeted testing approach, we have been able to avert Covid-19 spread to 18,000 persons and have controlled the curve,” Kumar asserted.

Comparing Gujarat to other global corona hotspots like Italy, France and Spain, the official said that Gujarat had successfully controlled the spread of the pandemic. “Spain registered 94,410, Italy registered 80,536 and France registered 56,972 cases in the past 35 days. In comparison, there have been 2,624 cases in Gujarat in the past 35 days,” said Kumar.

Commenting on the aggressive testing strategy, Kumar said that on April 15, tests were performed on 17,343 persons, while the number of those undergoing tests increased to 43,822 on April 24. “The state had just one testing facility in the first week, which has now increased to 15. The per-day testing capacity has increased for 150 in the first week to 3,770 in the fifth week,” the official said.

Kumar said that in a short span of time, the government had created a 10,500-bed facility in Covid-19 hospitals, while the total number of beds available for patients was 22,385.

The secretary said that along with testing and treating, the government had ensured that essential items like food and medicines were provided to people during the lockdown. “Even as there was an exodus of people after the lockdown was announced, the government has set up over 350 shelters to manage the exodus,” he said.

Kumar said that despite relaxation in the lockdown, the administration would be able to control the further spread of the pandemic and provide best possible treatment to Covid-19 positive patients.
