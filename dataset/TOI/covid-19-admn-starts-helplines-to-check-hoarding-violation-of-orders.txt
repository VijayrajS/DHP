2020-03-22
Ludhiana: The Ludhiana district administration has started dedicated 24X7 helpline numbers for residents to file complaints against black marketing and hoarding of essential commodities as well as any violation of prohibitory orders issued by the government regarding Covid-19. 

Additional deputy commissioner (development) Amrit Singh said, “When a person submits a complaint on helpline numbers --- 0161-2402347 and 9417228520, it would be duly entered in the register and the officials concerned such as Ludhiana police commissioner, SSP Khanna, SSP Ludhiana (Rural), DFSC Ludhiana, Zonal License Authority Ludhiana and civil surgeon Ludhiana would be intimated immediately.” 

“Each complaint would be assigned a unique complaint ID and when the complaint is resolved, the official who has dealt with that particular complaint, would submit action taken report in writing mentioning the unique complaint ID,” she said. 

She also warned that if anyone --- a person, shopkeeper, company or business establishment --- indulges in black marketing or hoarding of essential commodities or violates prohibitory orders issued by the government regarding Covid-19, strict penal action would be taken against them.

She urged the residents of Ludhiana district not to panic and not to indulge in panic buying as the entire situation is under control. 

The ADC said the district administration has made all necessary arrangements for the safety of residents and that no positive case of the virus has been reported in the district so far. 

Meanwhile, several residents did complain of “fleecing” by a few grocery stores and vegetable vendors.

“Apart from checking black marketing and hoarding, the administration should also focus on quality of milk and milk products as shopkeepers might start selling sub-standard material to cash in on the situation,” said Narinder Singh, a resident of Pakhowal road.
