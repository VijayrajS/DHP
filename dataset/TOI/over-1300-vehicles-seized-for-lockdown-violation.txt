NASHIK: Over 1,300 vehicles have been seized by city police from March 19 to April 9 for those flouting lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19.


A senior police officer said all the motorists have been booked under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant). "Their vehicles were taken to the respective police stations and will be returned after the lockdown is lifted," he said.

Police have issued clear instructions that use of personal vehicles is not allowed without any valid reason (like medical emergency), and only vehicles associated with the essential services can ply on the road. Still, a large number of people continue to neglect the instructions.

Among all the police stations, Nashik Road tops the chart by seizing 162 vehicles followed by Satpur (153), Bhadrakali (141) Mumbai Naka(132), Gangapur (125), Mhasrool(124), Sarkarwada (108), Indiranagar (103) Panchavati (101), Ambad (59), Upnagar (58), Deolali Camp (53) and Adgaon (46).

A senior police officer said the aim of seizing the vehicles was to ensure that people start realising that their vehicles would be seized if they venture out without any valid reason during the lockdown.

"A total of 2,497 people have been booked under section 188 of the IPC from March 22 to April 11," he said,

"Around 3,000 police personnel are working in shifts to ensure the lockdown is a success. The decision has been taken in the interest of everyone, but some people do not understand the importance of it. If people continue to neglect the lockdown, the situation would become worse," he added.

Meanwhile, commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare Patil on Sunday issued new orders about the timing of essential services in the city.

According to the new orders starting from Sunday to April 14, all establishments of essential services, excluding medical services and other essential services, would be allowed to operate only between 10 am to 4 pm.
