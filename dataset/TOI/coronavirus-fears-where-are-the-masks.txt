Coronavirus scare: Where are the masks in Ahmedabad?
2020-02-15
Ahmedabad: With the city hosting large events with delegates from across the world, the first precaution many citizens thought of taking against the novel coronavirus (NCoV) when being exposed to crowds, was to get N95 masks, to prevent the spread of the virus that has claimed more than 1,000 lives.


If you go to the market and ask for the mask, chances are it will not be available. Owners of medical stores in the city say there are two reasons for the phenomenon — the first is the reluctance of smaller shops to stock these masks which are now selling for twice their usual price, and the the second is a lack of awareness about the protocols for NCoV.

Dashrath Patel, the owner of a medical store in the city, said that for the past few days stocks of genuine N95 masks are not being received. “Masks sold in the market today are not respirators, having a filter to arrest particles. Most of these are being imported from the US,” he said. “These masks are also no guarantee that one won’t get the infection. There is still a lot to know about NCoV.”

Many blame wholesale dealers. A pharmacist in Paldi said the masks were earlier available in the city for about Rs 100-130. “Today, these same masks are being sold for Rs 200-250. Is this not profiteering? It is largely due to the scare among the citizens and the lack of awareness about ways to prevent the viral infection,” said the pharmacist.

Jayendra Rana, the owner of a medical store in Vastrapur, said they are waiting for new stocks of masks to arrive while demand rises. “Several stores are selling surgical masks or non-N95 masks at a premium,” he said.

Medical experts had earlier said that the masks can prevent respiration of viruses and the accidental touching of hands to the nose and mouth.
