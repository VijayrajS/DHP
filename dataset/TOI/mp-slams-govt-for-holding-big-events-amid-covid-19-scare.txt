He urged the central and state governments to take measures to ensure that hand sanitisers are adequately stocked in shops, since there has been demand ever since Covid -19 scare caught public attention. 

When asked about the AIADMK government stating that it has created medical infrastructure and facility required for the next two decades, he said that Tamil Nadu has better medical facilities compared to other states, he said.

Earlier, hundreds of people from various districts took part in the conference. Various resolutions were passed including one against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
