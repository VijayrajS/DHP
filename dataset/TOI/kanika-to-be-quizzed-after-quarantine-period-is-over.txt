LUCKNOW: Singer Kanika Kapoor will be questioned by Lucknow police after her quarantine period ends. After recovering from Covid-19, she was discharged from SGPGI on April 6 with advice to remain in self-isolation for 14 more days.


“The singer will be interrogated after her quarantine period ends on April 20,” said assistant commissioner of police, Krishnanagar, Deepak Kumar Singh on Thursday. 

Kanika had landed in Mumbai from UK on March 8. She was advised to stay in self-isolation for 14 days because of foreign travel, but she came to Lucknow on March 11 and moved around, participating in functions and hosting parties.

After she tested positive on March 20, Lucknow chief medical officer Narendra Kumar Agarwal had lodged an FIR against her under charges of negligence that could spread infection dangerous to life and disobedience of government order. However, all those including politicians she had met had tested negative later.

“We will question her about her medical screening at Mumbai airport and whether a stamp was put or not after examination there. She will also be asked if she was aware of the coronavirus threat and what precautions she took, besides why she attended functions despite cough and fever,” said Singh. 

Lucknow police have also written to Mumbai police commissioner seeking details of Kanika’s screening at the international airport and places she visited and stayed in Mumbai.
