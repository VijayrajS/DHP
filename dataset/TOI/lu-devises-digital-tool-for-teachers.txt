The massive open online course (MOOC) titled ‘Enhancing life skills through technology (EnList)’ has been developed after three years of research to help teachers integrate technology into education and give lectures or provide study materials virtually. 

The education department has started using EnList and the university is working on the modalities to make the course available on SWAYAM portal, developed by the HRD ministry. 

The research that gave birth to EnList was done by Shipra Srivastava, a scholar at LU’s education department, under the guidance of faculty member Kiran Lata Dangwal. 

Shipra conducted a survey of digital competence of around 450 teachers at six universities in UP, two central, two state-run and two private.

Shipra said EnList was based on Web 2.0 tools, which are free interactive digital programmes for using blogs for interactive lectures, Android-based applications for PowerPoint presentations, and doing online evaluation, among other things.

The four-week MOOC provides knowledge about blogging and can be used to effectively articulate and communicate views digitally through videos and content sharing.
