LUCKNOW: Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), working in the field of veterinary medicine and allied branches, has volunteered to join fight against novel coronavirus infection. IVRI has got Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) nod for starting Covid-19 testing facility.


According to reports, director, IVRI, Dr R K Singh told principal secretary, medical education, Rajneesh Dubey that the institute has bio safety level-two and level-three microbiology labs and it has been conducting coronovirus tests on animals for years. Singh stated that IVRI could conduct novel coronavirus testing on human beings provided it would get the ICMR's permission.

Immediately after getting the IVRI offer, Dubey contacted chief minister Yogi Adityanath who gave him signal to do the needful. The principal secretary then approached ICMR authorities to seek their approval and the required NOC was obtained in less than three days.

Talking to TOI, the IVRI director said that pooling of resources is key to tackle pandemics like Covid-19. IVRI's involvement in the Covid fight also highlights the government's approach in tackling zoonotic diseases affecting the man and the animal,” he said adding that “IVRI has been conducting coronavirus tests on bovines, birds and horses.” Singh, who is also vice- chancellor of the prestigious institute which is credited with developing drugs and vaccines for animals, said that with its research work the institute has succeeded in completely eradicating several diseases afflicting animals.

IVRI was established by Britishers and post-independence it came under control of the government of India and was handed over to the Union agriculture ministry’s Indian Council of Agriculture Research. Apart from Bareilly IVRI has campuses in Bengaluru, Bhopal, Kolkata and Srinagar.

In normal circumstances anybody talking about conducting human tests at an institute devoted to develop animal vaccines and medicines would have caused a flutter. “But the novel coronavirus pandemic has changed the thinking process. In this crisis times IVRI is trying to offer its services to the mankind,” Dubey said adding that “IVRI would start conducting Covid-19 tests as soon as it would get PPE and other paraphernalia needed for it.”

IVRI with the infrastructure of conducting at least 200 tests every day would help in reducing burden on medical colleges in western UP where the backlog is increasing day by day, said the principal secretary who has been appointed chairman of a high-powered committee to recommend ways to set up modern microbiology labs in the state.
