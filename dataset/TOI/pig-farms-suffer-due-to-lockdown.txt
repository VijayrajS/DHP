Pig farms suffer due to lockdown
2020-04-16
Mangaluru: The lockdown has put pig farm owners in trouble, due to the unavailability of food waste generated from hotels, wheat, rice bran and oil cakes, the major sources of food for pigs.

Philip D’Souza and his son Primus D’Souza of Prince Caterers from Neermarga, who rear pigs for catering orders, have now been forced to slaughter the animals and sell the pork at a lower price. “We have around 200 pigs, and a majority of their feed comes from hotels. It has become difficult for us to feed them due to the lockdown. We rear pigs exclusively for catering purposes. We had never supplied raw pork to the public in the last 25 years. However, the current situation has forced us to slaughter the animals and sell the pork at a cheaper rate,” said Primus.

Primus has been running to several places — during the morning hours, when the lockdown is eased — to collect feed for his pigs. “We are trying to collect rice bran and oil cakes from wherever possible. This apart, we are feeding the pigs rice, which is economically not viable,” Primus said, adding that the supply is not enough.

Due to the high demand for pork, Dakshina Kannada has several pig farms. The industry largely depends of leftover food from hotels and produce thrown away at vegetable markets. With hotels remaining closed for the past many weeks, and an inadequate supply of vegetables, stakeholders have resorted to mass slaughter of pigs, and are forced to sell pork at a cheap price.

“We have around 50 pigs. As there is a paucity of feed, we had to slaughter many pigs,” said a pig farm owner from Moodbidri.
