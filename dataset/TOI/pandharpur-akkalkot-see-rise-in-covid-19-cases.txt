2020-05-29
Kolhapur: Two popular religious destinations in Solapur district — Pandharpur and Akkalkot — have witnessed a gradual rise in the number of Covid-19 patients. Pandharpur tehsil has registered five patients so far while Akkalkot has reported three cases.

The first person to test positive for the contagion in Pandharpur is a resident of Upri village. He had returned from Mumbai. Of the five Covid-19 patients from Pandharpur, three have travel history to Mumbai, of which two are women. 

The rise in coronavirus cases in Pandharpur has put local administration on alert as several followers of Warkari sect, which has strong presence all over Maharashtra, are expected to arrive in Pandharpur after relaxation in nationwide lockdown. 

The prominent “Palkhi Sohla” of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram is scheduled to leave from Alandi and Dehu respectively on June 11. Lakhs of devotees of Vithoba are expected to come to Pandharpur on July 1 on account of Ashadhi Eakadashi. While the government is yet to decide on the nature of the annual program, local authorities fear that devotees will come to Pandharpur irrespective of restrictions. 

Akkalkot, which is located at a distance of 30 km from Solapur, has reported three Covid-19 cases so far. Of these three patients, one has travel history to Mumbai.
