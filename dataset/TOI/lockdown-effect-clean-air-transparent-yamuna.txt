Lockdown effect: Clean air, transparent Yamuna
2020-04-10
Agra: An unintended consequence of the nationwide lockdown, which has hit people and the economy hard, is a marked improvement in the quality of air and water, with the Yamuna turning decidedly cleaner and transparent. Literally, coronavirus and the lockdown have done what successive governments have promised to do but failed to follow up with. 

While air quality in Agra was recorded as “satisfactory” on Thursday, the Yamuna has turned transparent, a sight which even Agra veterans can’t recall. Clean water flowing behind the Taj is practically unimaginable, which is why the Union and state governments had had to release 500 cusecs to make the river appear presentable for US Presìdent Donald Trump’s visit in February. 

Mathura MP Hema Malini also tweeted a few pictures of the Yamuna in Mathura, saying it was amazing to see the pollution-free river. 

Normally, Yamuna gets polluted by effluents from industries along its banks, as well as bathing and washing by poor people living along its path, leftover and used flowers, garlands etc offered to the gods, and the like. Since lockdown has put a cap on all such activity, nature appears to have quickly regained vigour. 

Activist Gopeshwar Nath Chaturvedi, who had filed a PIL in Allahabad high court in 1998 for cleaning the river, said the major gamechanger has been a drastic fall in discharge of industrial effluents into the water.
