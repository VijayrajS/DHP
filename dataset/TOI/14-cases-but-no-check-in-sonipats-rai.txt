‘14 Covid-19 cases, but no check in Sonipat’s Rai’
2020-06-03
ROHTAK: Even after 14 cases of Covid-19 being detected in Sonipat’s industrial area, Rai village, the district administration is yet to demarcate a containment zone, seal the area or take any steps
 to prevent the spread of virus, according to locals.

Naresh Kaushik, a resident of Rai, told TOI that the village had a population of 15,000 migrants employed in factories. Kaushik said the first two cases were detected on May 29 and then 12 were detected on June 1.He said all positive cases were of migrant labourers who shared an accomodation with others in a cramped space where social distancing was impossible. Kaushik, who claims to be a soical activist, said lack of action by the district administration had left other residents of Rai vulnerable to contracting infection. Pankaj Sharma, a businessman from Rai, said the street from where the cases had been reported had turned into an attraction of sorts as others had been going to see it out of curiosity.

He described the administration’s inaction as “beyond explanation”. He that one of the patients is a vegetable vendor who has over 200 customers, but health department is yet to start contact tracing and test suspected cases.

Sonipat chief medical officer Dr B K Rajora said a team of the health department was shifting positive cases to the hospital for treatment and were also engaged in contact tracing as per protocol.
