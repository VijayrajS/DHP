DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old woman who needed urgent medical attention due to complications in her pregnancy but was told by a hospital to come after two months died days after giving birth to twins as four more hospitals she went to later turned her away suspecting her to be a Covid-19 carrier. 


The woman was finally admitted to a fifth hospital after a local MLA intervened, but she died on Thursday, two days after giving birth to the babies in the seventh month of her pregnancy. 


The Uttarakhand health secretary, chief medical officer and the district magistrate have ordered three separate inquiries into the incident. 

Kamlesh Saini, who cremated his wife, Sudha, on Friday said they had gone to a government hospital on Monday when his wife first complained of pain in the stomach. “The hospital told us to come back when she completes nine months of her pregnancy and said that she was anaemic and must be administered blood. They didn’t even examine her properly.” 

A day later, Sudha gave birth to twins, who died just hours later. Her health then got worse. 

On Thursday, the couple was turned away by several hospitals as the woman was running a temperature. “I took her to two government hospitals and two private hospitals but all of them refused to admit her, claiming that she had high temperature and could be a Covid-19 patient,” said Saini, who does odd jobs here and there to make a living. 

After the victim’s family managed to contact Cantt MLA Harbans Kapoor on Thursday evening, the woman was admitted to a government hospital. She died two hours later in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 

“How can government hospitals turn her away when she was in a critical condition? A departmental inquiry has been ordered in the matter,” said Dehradun CMO D C Ramola.
