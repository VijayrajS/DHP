 A special session of the standing committee was called on Wednesday to review the steps being taken to prevent the spread of the virus. Committee members pointed out that after the closure of gyms, footfall had increased in parks and commonly touched surfaces like benches, open gyms, railings and gates posed a health risk.

Ordering a disinfection drive in north corporation parks, civic commissioner Varsha Joshi assured the members of the standing committee that an awareness campaign would be started to educate morning walkers, yoga and laughter clubs members about the risk of the coronavirus. Other steps taken by the north civic body include sending over 10 lakh bulk SMSs to raise awareness about the disease.

The issue of shortage of masks and resources was also flagged at the meeting. Congress functionary Mukesh Goyal said mere speeches would be of no help and that the civic body should procure more resources. Joshi informed the committee that experts have clearly pointed out that at this stage, masks should only be worn by healthcare workers or patients.
