2020-04-12
Hyderabad: Former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir condemned BJP and a section of mainstream and social media for their attempts to give communal colour to the spread of coronavirus. He said such attempts were highly objectionable and aimed at diverting people’s attention from the failures of the government. He urged people not to believe in rumours. “Stay united and safe,” he said, while distributing essential commodities to the needy in Tolichowki on Saturday. TNN
