2020-03-27
Meerut: At a time when government authorities continue to claim that essential services, including medicines, will be made available during the 21-day lockdown, the Meerut Chemists’ Association members warn of shortage of medicines if the chain of supply is not resumed.“The last stock was delivered to most of the medical stores on March 21, after which the stock which comes mainly from Ghaziabad is on hold. The companies in question say that the trucks are not being allowed to cross the borders due to the lockdown. In some cases, drivers of carriers are being heckled. We have already informed the district authorities about the matter but we have not been updated about any progress,” said Naresh Chandra Gupta, president, Meerut Chemists’ Association.Meerut has a total of 4,000 wholesale and retail medical stores.“We have already told the Meerut district magistrate and divisional commissioner about the supply chain issue because the vehicles ferrying medicine stocks from Ghaziabad are not being allowed to enter Meerut,” said Upendra Bansal, general secretary, Meerut Chemists’ Association.On his part, Meerut district magistrate Anil Dhingra said, “I have already communicated the matter of ferrying of medicines from Ghaziabad to their district administration, and there is nothing to worry. The medicines will be delivered soon.”
