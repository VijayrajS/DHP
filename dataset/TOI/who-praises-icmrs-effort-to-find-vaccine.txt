NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday praised the Indian government’s commitment to combat the novel coronavirus and the progress made by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) towards identifying isolates for a vaccine.


“I think the commitment of the Indian government from the top level — the PM himself — has been enormous, very impressive. This is one of the reasons why India is doing very well,” WHO representative to India Henk Bekedam said after meeting officials at the ICMR.

“We have very good research capacity in India and especially at the ICMR and the Department of Health Research. They have been able to isolate the virus, (and) now India will continue to be part of the research community,” Bekedam said.

Last week, the ICMR had announced that Indian scientists had been successful in isolating the new strain of coronavirus.
