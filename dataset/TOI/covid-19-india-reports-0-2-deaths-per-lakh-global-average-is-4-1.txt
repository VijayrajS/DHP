Covid-19: India reports 0.2 deaths per lakh, global average is 4.1
2020-05-20
NEW DELHI: Even as Covid-19 cases in India exceeded one lakh, deaths from the infection are much lower than the global average if population density is taken into account. India has about 0.2 deaths per lakh population compared to around 4.1 deaths per lakh population for the world, the health ministry said, underlining that timely identification and clinical management of cases had helped reduce deaths in the country. 



In the US, the country now hardest hit by the pandemic, the case mortality per lakh population stood at 26.6. For China, where the virus first began spreading, the figure is 0.3, the ministry said citing World Health Organisation’s situation report on Covid-19.

In absolute numbers, India registered 3,163 deaths out of 101,139 confirmed cases. In the last 24 hours, the death toll increased by 134 but the ministry highlighted that 2,350 patients had been cured in a single day, taking the recovery rate to 38.73%.

A total of 39,174 patients have been cured of Covid-19 so far, whereas 58,802 cases are still active. Of the active cases, only about 2.9% were in the ICU, health ministry data showed. Analysts said India had done well in keeping transmission as well as deaths low as compared to other nations, even after accounting for the low number of tests per million people.

“India’s numbers remain much lower than what many experts had predicted at the beginning of the outbreak,” Oommen C Kurian, senior fellow of health initiative at Observer Research Foundation, said.
