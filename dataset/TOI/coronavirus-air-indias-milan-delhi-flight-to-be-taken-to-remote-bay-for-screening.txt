Coronavirus: Air India's Milan-Delhi flight to be taken to remote bay for screening
2020-03-11
NEW DELHI: Delhi Airport has made special provisions for Air India’s Milan-Delhi flight which will be landing on Wednesday morning. Sources say the aircraft will be taken to an isolation bay (number 13) where passengers and crew will alight the Boeing 787 operating as AI 138 from Milan Malpensa using stepladder. They will be individually screened on the tarmac for coronavirus. Italy is seeing the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China.


Italian carrier Alitalia had Sunday announced suspension of both domestic and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport after the government ordered a lockdown of large areas of northern Italy. Alitalia said it would operate only domestic flights from the smaller Milan Linate airport until at least April 3.

A fierce debate is on within Air India whether the airline should continue flying to Italy and South Korea capital Seoul. 
“Our twice weekly flights from Delhi to Rome and Milan each are going almost empty and we have full loads flying back. There is great risk of infection while flying people back from Italy. Although people from Italy and South Korea need a heath certificate saying they are corona-free to be allowed to enter India, whether someone is infected with this flu is known only after 14 days. So one may be carrying a health certificate but could still be detected to have the flu later,” said a worried senior crew member.

Sources say a decision on cancelling AI flights to Italy and Seoul, whose frequencies have been reduced, has not been taken so far due to “national commitment of the national airline”. “We are exposing our crew to great risk of being infected by continuing to fly to Italy. Really hope the government takes a decision on this issue soon,” said another crew member.
