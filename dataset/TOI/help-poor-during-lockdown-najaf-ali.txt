Hyderabad: Mir Najaf Ali Khan, grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, urged people to combat the spread of Covid-19 while observing the 134th birth anniversary of Osman Ali Khan on Monday.

He said that people in the lower income group and daily-wage workers have been affected the most during the lockdown. “Let us take care of those who are not privileged like us, and donate essentials like rice, milk, and other groceries to those in your locality. It doesn’t make a lot of difference to us when we donate, but it does to the ones who receive. Help them by easing their worries about how to get their next meal without their daily jobs. Take the initiative and help them not with money but with basic necessities,” said Khan.

He said that the last Nizam is still remembered as a highly benevolent ruler who always thought of providing the best modern facilities to his people irrespective of caste or religion. 

“In view of the present situation, I have decided not to visit the grave of my grandfather Mir Osman Ali Khan so that all of us become responsible citizens and practice social distancing to curb the spread of the virus,” he said. 

He said that the Nizam’s government had set up a separate quarantine facility for patients suffering from cholera and the gramophone was used to spread awareness among the public on hygiene. “People were vaccinated in a mass vaccination drive,”he said.
