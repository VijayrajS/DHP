Influx of workers into villages can worsen Covid-19 situation: MLA
2020-04-30
Mandya: With the influx of thousands of people from Mumbai into villages in KR Pete and Nagamangala taluks, there are fears that it could cause the novel coronavirus to spread in these areas, which was raised in a meeting chaired by medical education minister K Sudhakar in Mandya.

Sudhakar held a meeting with people’s representatives and district officials. Nagamangala JD(S) MLA Sureshgowda voiced his concern, that thousands of people from his constituency, who were residing in Mumbai, had sneaked into their native villages here, in violation of the lockdown, which could cause the novel coronavirus to spread.

Sureshgowda urged the district administration to carry out testing for Covid-19, on a massive scale in his constituency, as there is a likelihood of the disease spreading in the villages there, due to the influx of people working in Mumbai.

“A person from Satenahalli village in my constituency, who is a hotelier in Mumbai, tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He had entered the village by violating the lockdown. Like him, thousands of people have already sneaked into their native villages here. The Covid-19 case in Satenahalli village is just the tip of the iceberg. The district administration must start testing all the people who came here from Mumbai and Bengaluru,” Sureshgowda demanded.

Sudhakar assured Sureshgowda that state government must take every possible step to detect and contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
