SURAT: The massive contact tracing of Covid-19 infections launched by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has revealed that 26 persons who tested positive were infected by two vegetable vendors. The drive was intensified after 26 positive cases surfaced from societies and apartments in Ashwini Kumar Road area in one week.

SMC officials said the positive cases have been reported from Ataljinagar, Suryanagar, Vishalnagar, Modi Maholla, Ramnath Ovaro, Bhaktinagar, Rupali Society, Dhartinagar, Anandnagar Avash and Satyam Shivam Sundaram Apartment in Ashwini Kumar area in East zone (A) area.

“In order to trace the source of infections, we carried out mass testing of 107 grocers, vegetable vendors and dairy product sellers. The results revealed that two vegetable vendors who were Covid-19 positive were regular visitors to these areas,’’ said an SMC official. “We believe that these people have been infected from vegetable vendors,’’ said sources.

Moreover, the two vendors were asymptomatic. “Asymptomatic patients can spread more infections and therefore we urge citizen to wear masks and use sanitizers whenever they go to purchase essentials. If precautions are not taken, chances of getting infected are very high,’’ said an officer.
