VADODARA: As many as 14 persons remain quarantined at home in Vadodara city after return from countries affected by COVID-19 outbreak. The numbers went up since about a week as the number of countries where the outbreak was reported increased.


On March 5, only five persons were advised to stay quarantined at home as they had returned from China and other affected countries. By Monday, the number increased to 18 including four Italian tourists who were staying at a hotel.

Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) health department officials are keeping a close tab of persons who have travelled to the city from countries that are facing the viral outbreak. It came to light on Monday that a group of tourists from Italy had come to the city. They had travelled widely in the state making the officials wary. With Italy having a large number of COVID-19 cases, panic triggers were pressed.

The tourists were asked to stay in isolation at the hotel and were examined by a team of doctors. Their samples were collected immediately and the samples were sent to Ahmedabad for analysis. It came to light that they were not suffering from COVID-19 and were allowed to go, said an official. He added that they had a flight to Italy from Delhi on Tuesday.

With the four Italian tourists being allowed to go, the number of persons advised isolation stood at 14 on Wednesday. These 14 persons too have not shown any COVID-19 symptoms so far.

VMC officials said that the number of persons being kept in home quarantine had increased because more and more countries are getting affected by the outbreak.
