MUMBAI: Maharashtra recorded 120 Covid-19 deaths on Saturday, its second highest toll in a day. The highest deaths so far in a day was 139, on Friday. Of the 120 deaths, 58 were in Mumbai, the city’s highest fatalities for a day; its toll stands at 1,577. The state’s overall toll is now 2,969, just shy of the 3,000 mark.


The state added 2,739 new cases on Saturday, taking the tally to 82,968. Mumbai recorded 1,274 fresh cases, taking the city’s tally to 47,354 cases, with the case fatality rate at 3.33%. 

The state update said that of the total deaths reported on Saturday, 30 were from the last two days, while the other 90 were from May 3 to June 3. 

Since Monday, the state has reported 683 deaths. Of the 120 deaths, 90 were from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

The BMC’s daily Covid-19 update too spoke of 57 (as against the state update, which said 58). The BMC said 39 of these victims had chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes or heart problems. While 29 of the dead were in the 40-60 age-group, 21 were above 60 years of age and seven were under 40. While 23 of the 57 victims were women, 34 were men.

Over a quarter of a lakh patients in the city are actively fighting the disease at the moment, a BMC official said. “We have been seeing between 1,000 and 1,500 cases on most days in the last fortnight, with a few days having more than 1,700. But the graph seems to be steady,” the official said.

“The city’s peak was in the second fortnight of May, we are now witnessing a plateauing of cases,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, dean of the Indian College of Physicians and a member of the state task force. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the doubling time has improved to 20 days across the city and is higher in some pockets. “We cannot say for certain that the worst is over, but we are on the proper track,” he said. “The next few days are crucial as the lockdown is being relaxed and we could see a spike in the next few weeks,” Kakani said.

He said the BMC has been actively recruiting doctors, especially those from alternative therapies who can supervise quarantine centres. “We have also reached out to doctors from the green zones of Latur, Wardha and Ambejogai,” he said.
