Kolhapur: Satara registered its fourth case on Sunday after a 54-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19. His throat swab samples were sent to NIV, Pune, on Saturday and the reports on Sunday confirmed the infection.

According to the district health department officials, the patient works as a driver in Mumbai and has been staying alone for the last 14 years while his family stays in a village near Satara. He is diabetic and had travelled to his native place on March 8 using a private vehicle. He reported of cold and fever on March 30 at a rural primary health centre in Satara.

Shekhar Singh, district collector, Satara, told TOI that there is little uncertainty over his travel history. “Our officials are working out the patient’s exact date of arrival and other details,” he said. 

“The preliminary information that we have received states that he was suggested home quarantine upon his arrival, though he was not stamped. He had a fever on March 27 and reported it to a primary health centre on March 30. We found that he had severe pneumonia from his X-ray report on April 3. He was referred to the district hospital on April 4, when his swab sample was sent to NIV, Pune,” said Aniruddha Athalye, Satara’s district health officer. 

He added that they are already working to trace his close associates and the primary health centre staff members, where he was admitted. They all have been asked to quarantine themselves. 

The patient has a wife, two daughters and a son. “There is also a possibility that the patient might have travelled to other parts of the village or to some other event, which needs to be verified,” said Athalye.

On Sunday, the health department officials sent 11 swab samples to NIV. Among them, four had a travel history to Delhi during the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz period. The collector confirmed that the swab sample of the first two positive cases has also been sent to the NIV for further tests. “If found negative, we will start with the discharge formalities,” said Singh.
