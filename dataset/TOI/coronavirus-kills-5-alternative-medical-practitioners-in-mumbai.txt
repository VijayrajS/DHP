Coronavirus kills 5 alternative medical practitioners in Mumbai
2020-05-30
MUMBAI: At least five alternative medical practitioners have succumbed to novel coronavirus in the city over the past one month, prompting the fraternity to demand an insurance cover for their families. The latest to die was a 51-year-old Unani practitioner, who not just manned the state's 108 ambulance service, but also ran his own clinic. 

The Cheetah Camp resident stopped reporting to work from May 12 when he developed the first symptoms, said his family. Authorities from 108 said he used to be designated the spot outside Dadar station and was extremely caring towards his patients. "After finishing his shift, which sometimes stretched to 12 hours, he would open his clinic and treat patients," said Dr Kishor Deo of 108. His family said he would wear the PPE before meeting his patients. He is survived by his wife and two sons. 

The family, though, admitted he did delay his hospitalization till May 23. "By then, he was in severe pain and needed non-invasive ventilation. He tested positive on May 26 and passed away a day later," said Dr Deo, adding they were informed about his serious condition towards the end. 

Dr Zubair Shaikh, general secretary of the Integrated Medicine Practitioners Association (IMPA), said Unani practitioners have kept their clinics open but paid with their lives. "There have been deaths in Dharavi, Govandi and Bhandup. We had requested the state to provide our families with a comprehensive personal accident cover of Rs 50 lakh under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting Covid-19, but we haven't got a response," he said. Shaikh, though, said BMC did start giving PPEs to Unani clinics.
