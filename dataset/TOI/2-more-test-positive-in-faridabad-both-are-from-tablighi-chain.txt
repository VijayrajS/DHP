Gurgaon: Two more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Faridabad on Sunday, taking the district’s total number of cases to 31. Both the patients are from the Tablighi Jamaat chain, the health department said.

According to Dr Ram Bhagat, deputy civil surgeon, Faridabad, “One of the patients is a 22-year-old man whose father had attended the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi and had tested positive earlier. The second patient is a 34-year-old man who was a TJ attendee.”

The health department sent 56 samples for testing on Saturday, out of which 53 came out negative. The result of one is awaited.

Dr Bhagat said both the patients are residents of Badhkal area of Faridabad, which is currently one of the containment zones. “We observed that many people who had attended the Jamaat are residents of Badhkal. So we are getting most of our cases from that area. Our teams are now sanitising the place,” he added.

 The health department said as a large number of people who came in contact with the Covid-19 patients were unaware, the situation had become tricky.

Meanwhile, a 54-year-old woman and her son were discharged from hospital on Sunday after full recovery. The health department said Faridabad will have a new testing facility at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute.
