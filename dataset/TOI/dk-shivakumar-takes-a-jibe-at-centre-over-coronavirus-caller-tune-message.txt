DK Shivakumar takes a jibe at Centre over coronavirus caller tune message
2020-03-11
BENGALURU: Using a Kannada adage to describe the Covid-19 awareness/warning message mandated as a caller tune by the Union ministry of telecom, former Karnataka minister DK Shivakumar on Tuesday took a jibe at the Centre. 

"It's like treating the ox when it's the buffalo that has the fever..." he tweeted in Kannada, adding that people are fed up with this. "...From prices of fruits and vegetables to the stock markets, everything has nose-dived," the tweet further read.

The original Kannada adage, 'Ettige jwara bandre, emme ge bare hakidrante', translates into 'It is like branding a buffalo when the ox develops fever'.

Pointing out that the country's economy is in a shambles, he said the government must put in efforts where required and "not simply scare people." "...Govt must take necessary steps to prevent #CoronaVid19 & ensure there is no panic among people as it has serious consequences on the economy (sic)," he said in another tweet.

His tweets elicited a host of responses, with most people appearing to agree with him on the caller tune. Some, however, sought to rub it in. "Go save the Madhya Pradesh (MP) MLAs," one suggested.

A Twitter user asked him how BJP had managed to bring MP MLAs to Bengaluru with him being around.
