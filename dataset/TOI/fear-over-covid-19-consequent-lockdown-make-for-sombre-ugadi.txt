Vijayawada/Visakhapatnam: Ugadi in the state this year will be a low-key affair following the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. 

This time, with fear around the rising number of Covid-19 cases and the lockdown till March 31, “we are also not in the mood to celebrate the festival in a grand manner,” said V Ravi Teja and V Bhavani, a couple who visited a vegetable market in Vijayawada on Tuesday to purchase goods for the Telugu New Year. “We have also appealed to people to celebrate a safe Ugadi,” they added.

Police have also urged people to observe the day by celebrating at home and cooperating with the government order on the lockdown.

Political parties in the state have decided to call of ‘Panchanga Sravanam’, the ritual reading of the almanac. The ‘Panchanga Sravanam’ and distribution of Ugadi ‘pachhadi’ at temples stands cancelled following their shutdown in keeping with the government order.

Vijayawada police has declared that no festive markets will be permitted on Wednesday and have appealed to people to celebrate keeping in mind the need for social distancing to prevent the rise in number of Covid-19 cases. 

In Vizag, Visakhapatnam district Archaka Sangham general secretary Ayiluru Srinivasa Deekshitulu told TOI, “People visit temples on Ugadi to offer special prayers but this time we are all praying for this situation across the world to come under control.”

K Mahalakshmi, a teacher from Seethammadhara in Vizag said that this time they have decided to keep themselves away from Ugadi celebrations. “Instead, we wanted to stay at home and clean our house,” Mahalakshmi said. Executive director of APSRTC Ravi Kumar said while special buses are operated for Ugadi every year, all services have been suspended this time.
