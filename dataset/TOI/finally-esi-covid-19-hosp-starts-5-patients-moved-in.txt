Panaji: The ESI hospital at Margao, which was designated a Covid-19 hospital a few days ago, was finally commissioned on Sunday with all patients transferred to it. With two new cases detected today, the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 has risen to five in the state.

Until Sunday afternoon, only one patients was being treated in ESI hospital while two were in the isolation ward of the Goa Medical College (GMC). The GMC authorities, who were ready to shift the two patients under its care to the ESI hospital earlier, had to defer plan until today.

A senior government official said an anesthetist attached to GMC had certified that the ESI hospital was adequate for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, but the government requested former GMC dean V N Jindal to conduct an inspection with other members.

“Hence, the two patients could not be transferred there immediately even though the GMC had the ESI hospital inspected by an ICU expert. The expert did not point to any discrepancies and there was no need for a fresh examination. The commissioning of the hospital was delayed,” the official said.

The 60-bed hospital is relatively new. Provision for ten ventilators have been made,” he said.

Secretary, department of health and family welfare, Preeti Sudan had written to chief secretaries of all states and Union territories to create a fully dedicated standalone hospital for Covid-19 patients as it will able to provide specialised care for the unique needs of the confirmed cases and prevent risk of transmission.

Professor and head of medicine department, Dr Edwin Gomes has been appointed nodal officer of the ESI Covid-19 hospital. A team of frontline doctors comprising physicians, anaesthesiologist, pulmonary specialist, ENT experts and expert nurses for ICU have been posted there, the official said.
