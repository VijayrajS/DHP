Communities to fight the pandemic
2020-03-25
Ahmedabad: In middle of March, when the discussion on COVID-19 was at its peak but Gujarat had not recorded its first case, Knowledge Management and Innovations for Change (KMIC) at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) organized an online meeting. On the lines were not business honchos or thought leaders, it were the municipal councillors of Ahmedabad city and the outcomes were not elaborate plans but simple and implementable solutions.

Prof Ankur Sarin, part of Public Systems Group (PSG) at IIM-A, said that KMIC – a collaboration of IIM-A and UNICEF – has been working with municipal councillors for past two years in several ways. “This time, we identified the socially active ones and engaged them in pushing sanitization practices such as washing hands,” he said. Shahnawaz Shaikh, a councillor from Jamalpur ward, distributed kits containing soap, sanitizers and masks. About 300 kits were distributed in the first phase where there are no COVID-19 cases.

Hiren Jadav, another councillor from Odhav, prepared posters for creating awareness in his area, said IIM-A officials.
