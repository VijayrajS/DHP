Nagpur: A stress buster musical program was organized for cops posted on Covid-19 duties, jointly by Sahyog Trust, Swaraj Foundation and Nagpur police department at Ram Nagar Square on Monday.

The 30-minute event was organized for cops in view of the hectic schedule and pressure these cops are going through since last over a month in the fight against coronavirus. 

Cops were seen clapping and enjoying the 
Hindi film songs being played live by flute artist Gajendra Gabhane, including from the film Hero. Local residents joined in by bringing juice for the cops, who were lauded for performing their duties like heroes in the time of corona pandemic risking their own life.

Ravindra Bhusari, trustee of Sahyog Trust, said that such events for the cops go a long way in relieving their stress. Music acts as a stress buster and hence we thought of such an event for these heros, he said.

Sandesh Singalkar, president of Swaraj Foundation, said they organized this event only for cops keeping precautions in mind like masks and social distancing, and with the permission of the police department.

Vijay Kare, police inspector at Ambazari police station, thanked the organizers for organizing the lovely programme specially for cops. “Around 20 cops participated in this event, organized under a tree, keeping all precautions of social distancing in account. We have asked the organizers to hold more such event in the evenings, when cops go home after duty, so that the cops can really relax after their hectic duties,” he said.
