JAIPUR: The Special Operations Group (SOG), along with the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) and the cyber cell, arrested a man from Ajmer for posting provocative message on social media and spreading fake news about coronavirus.

Till now, action has been taken in over 300 such matters and 10 cases registered by the SOG who has been keeping a close watch on social media activities to ensure that no panic is created in the state about the pandemic.

Sanjeev Kumar Gupta was arrested by the SOG from Ajmer for posting objectionable content on a WhatsApp group with the intent to disrupt communal harmony, claimed officials. Anil Paliwal, ADG (SOG and ATS) said, “Our team has been keeping a close watch on the content which is shared between people on social media platforms especially on those posts which can create communal disharmony or give rise to spread of fake news about coronavirus. While scanning the content, we found that the accused had posted a message on social media which was inflammatory in nature because of which he was arrested.”

Cops have been keeping a strict vigil on social media activities to ensure that it is not being misused to spread false narrative about Covid-19.

“We have teams who are monitoring all forms of social media to ensure that no one tries to create panic among residents by sending fake messages. Strict action is being taken against those who have been found to be doing so and more arrests are likely in the future,” added a police officer. Although a bailable offence, cops are hopeful that more arrests will act as deterrent for people to avoid posting such messages. An official said, “In times like this, it is crucial that we do not let fake news be spread to create panic. At the same time it is of utmost importance that communal harmony be maintained in this time of crisis. We will take action as and when required.”
