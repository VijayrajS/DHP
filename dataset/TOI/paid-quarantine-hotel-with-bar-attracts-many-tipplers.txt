KOTTAYAM: Can liquor be sold from the same building or compound where people are under paid quarantine? Though authorities gave a green signal to such a bar hotel, the long queue for buying liquor on Thursday morning raised questions over the functioning of a hotel as a paid quarantine centre. 

The unusual situation came up at Hotel Aida in town where people, mostly NRKs and people who arrived from other states chose to go on a paid quarantine. At present, there are 27 people staying under paid quarantine. The government, on Thursday, allowed the sale of liquor as takeaways. There were long queues outside the hotel from 9am till the closure of the counter at 5pm. 

Collector PK Sudheer Babu said that the entries to the hotel and the bar counter were separate. "The people in quarantine were staying in the second and third floors. The counter was on the ground floor. The hotel management had submitted an affidavit regarding this. We had forwarded this to the excise department," he said.

Deputy excise commissioner AR Zulfikar said the department had inspected the place and there was nothing unusual about the arrangement. "The hotel got the permission from the disaster management authority. Those staying there are not confirmed with Covid-19 and the rooms are far away from the takeaway counter of the bar," he said. 

The guests here pay rent for seven days in advance. The rooms are given at a subsidised rate (20pc). There is no subsidy for food. A health worker is present in the hotel round the clock. Two persons are working on shifts for this.

Hotel authorities have given strict guidelines to guests like not venturing out of their rooms for a walk outside. The guests are also given the option to get food from the community kitchen set up by the local body.
