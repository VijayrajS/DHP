Meerut: A double murder accused lodged in a temporary jail has been tested positive for coronavirus. An old enmity between two groups in Jasaura village in Meerut led to a full-blown clash involving stone-pelting and firing from rooftops. Two brothers — Khaliq and Majid — received bullets in the head and stomach, and both of them died.

Out of the five arrested in the case, one person has tested positive. “In fact, two persons lodged in temporary jail tested positive on Wednesday,” said Meerut chief medical officer Dr Raj Kumar.

The incident occurred on Tuesday when political rivalry between the families of Niyaz Ahmad former village pradhan and sitting pradhan Mohd Aslam — having a reputation of fighting with each other — had a fresh clash. During the clash, associates of Niyaz Ahmad shot at Khaliq and Majid, and both of them died.

According to SP (rural) Avinash Pandey, "Five persons were arrested while the rest are on the run."
