NEW DELHI: Delhi government has directed head of departments, autonomous bodies and municipal corporations to suspend the biometric attendance system in the wake of the novel coronavirus scare.


Delhi government has over 70,000 employees, including officers, stationed in different departments at Delhi Secretariat, hospitals, educational institutions and offices in Civil Lines.

In its missive to all HoDs, the general administration department of Delhi government referred to a letter from the health department, which advised them to suspend the biometric attendance system till further orders. The letter, issued by deputy secretary Promila Mitra, said the coronavirus was highly contagious and could spread from humans to humans on touching a common object.

Till further orders, the employees have been asked to mark their attendance manually.

Delhi government is, meanwhile, firming up its preparations to deal with any contingency. It has asked all hospitals to be on high alert. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday visited Lok Nayak Hospital to check its preparedness to combat coronavirus.

“Delhi government has set up a separate ward in LNJP to treat the affected people. We have 11 separate rooms where only confirmed patients will stay on a single-occupancy basis. The suspected patients will be treated in the ward, which is also isolated. This ward has separate entrance, so that there is no risk to others,” Jain said, adding that the government was prepared to increase the number of rooms and facilities as and when required.
