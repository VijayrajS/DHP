2020-03-27
Palanpur: The mood was sombre, ‘digitally’ literally! While the picture of Jayanti Darji was adorning the photo frame, there were only five members of his family sitting at his besna, the meet to mourn the dead and offer tributes. 

However, hundreds of tributes soon started pouring in as Darji’s family members connected with their relatives and friends through video conferencing.

“Not only Darji’s relatives, but his own son who lives in Mumbai paid his tributes through video conferencing. At a time when PM is appealing to his countrymen to strictly follow the lockdown to stop the further spread of coronavirus, the Darji family should be commended for taking the initiative of digital besna and thereby, practicing social distancing,” said one of the friends of the family.
