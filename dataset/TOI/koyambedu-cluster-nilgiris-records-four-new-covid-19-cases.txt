UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiris registered four new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, 25 days since reporting its last case.

The new cases come at a time when the district was on the verge of moving from the orange zone to green after nine positive cases were discharged following treatment.

Of the four new cases, two hail from Kilkozhikarai near Nanjanadu in Ooty taluk, while the third is from Kakkanji colony, Nanjanadu, and the fourth of Nehru Nagar, Selas in Coonoor taluk.

All the four positive cases are truck drivers who had visited Koyambedu market in Chennai, and are being treated at the ESI Hospital in Coimbatore.

Soon after Koyambedu market emerged as a hotspot for the virus, health officials in the district started isolating truck drivers returning home. Officials identified about 40 truck drivers with a travel history to Koyambedu in the last week. Samples from all the 40 were drawn for tests for Covid-19.

“The four cases are out of the 40 truck drivers who were tested for the virus. The remaining 36 tested negative,” said Dr P Balusamy, deputy director, public health. 

For the past three days, 24 truck drivers who returned from Koyambedu have been quarantined at the Coonoor Government Lawley Hospital. Their results are expected in a day or two.

Collector J Innocent Divya said, “All locations from where the four positive cases hail have been sealed... people in these areas are advised not to venture out unnecessarily.”
