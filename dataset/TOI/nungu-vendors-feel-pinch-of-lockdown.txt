‘Nungu’ vendors feel pinch of lockdown
2020-04-26
Trichy: The fall in demand and sale of ‘nungu’ (palm fruit), has left the seasonal vendors in the lurch amid lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. Vendors said that there is a steep decline in the supply of the fruit due to curfew restrictions and added that even the number of customers has gone down.

While summer is the peak season for palm fruit, sellers in the city said they are getting very limited stock from the farmers as they could not travel to the area where the fruits are available.

V Selvam, 55, a resident of Woraiyur in Trichy usually sells the fruit during summer. He had leased a palmyra grove in Thanjavur, which has around 2,000 trees. However, due to lockdown, he could not cross the district borders to get the fruits, he said. 

“Since I am not allowed to cross the district border, I could not get fruits from the grove. I was forced to roam around the outskirts of Trichy in search of palmyra trees and their owners. I managed to collect two gunny bags of the fruit. For these two bags, I have to spend Rs 500 to Rs 750 for a mini truck to carry them. Due to so much expense, I could not earn a profit. Sales equalize the cost of purchase,” he said.

Another vendor P Krishnamoorthi from Kattur, said that due to poor demand he could not sell the fruit at a nominal rate. “Due to lockdown, I hardly find people on the roads. After hearing the price of the fruit, nobody is willing to purchase it. However, I could not sell them below the purchase cost,” he added. Every year the price of the fruit has been increasing. Nowadays people realize the goodness of ‘Nungu’. So, automatically the demand has gone up, said R Prasad, a resident of Woraiyur. “Last year I bought one fruit for Rs 5. Now it is Rs 7 to 8. Vendors attributed poor supply for the rise in price,” he added.
