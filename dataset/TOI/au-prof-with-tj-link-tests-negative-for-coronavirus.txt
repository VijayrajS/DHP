Prayagraj: The Allahabad University (AU) sprofessor, who kept information about attending the Tablighi Jammat event in Delhi from police, tested negative for novel coronavirus (Covid1-19) on Saturday — two days after he and his family were quarantined at a guest house in Kareli. 

The professor’s wife and son, who were quarantined along with him, also tested negative. 

The three were picked up from their Rasoolabad house on Wednesday night by Prayagraj police and quarantined.

According to reports, he had returned to Prayagraj after attending the congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi from March 6-10

An FIR was registered against him at Shivkuti police station for not informing the authorities about his travel history. 

Police said the man had also visited Ethiopia a few months before attending the Tablighi event in Delhi. He returned to Prayagraj on March 11 and was put on invigilator duty by the university from March 12-16. He was allotted duty in a hall in which over 140 students appeared for their exams on each of the five days. 

Swab samples of the professor and his family members were sent to MLN Medical College for testing and the reports showed that they were negative. They are still being quarantined as a precautionary measure.

AU administration is mulling serving a notice to the professor. 

“The university was waiting for the test results. We are relieved that the faculty member tested negative for Covid-19. The varsity may issue a notice to the professor for hiding his travel history from the authorities,” said AU public relations officer Shailendra Mishra.
