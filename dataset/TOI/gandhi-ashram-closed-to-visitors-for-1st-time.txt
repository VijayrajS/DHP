AHMEDABAD: For the first time in the history of Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram, trustees have unanimously decided to close the Ashram to visitors till March 29, or until the Covid-19 pandemic situation eases off, whichever is later. Each day, more than 3,000 people visit the Ashram including a number of international and domestic tourists. Over the past three days, footfalls had reduced to 800 to 1,000.

“We took our decision based on the advisories of the government and the WHO and have unanimously decided to close Ashram premises till March 29,” said Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust director, Atul Pandya.

When Gandhiji established his base in Ahmedabad in 1915 following his return from South Africa, he chose a bungalow at Kochrab village on the outskirts of the city. However, two years later, in May 1917, a plague-like illness had broken out in the village and Bapu decided to set up his new base at Sabarmati Ashram. Since Bapu’s death the Ashram was never closed to visitors, even on public holidays.
