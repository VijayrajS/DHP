2020-05-26
CHENNAI: A psychological battle coupled with discipline with taking medicines is very important when one gets Covid-19 and is forced to spend days in isolation, said deputy commissioner of AnnaNagar M S Muthusamy. The DCP was infected while working in the frontline and gave an emotional speech while rejoining duty on Monday.

Other officers including the city police commissioner A K Vishwanathan welcomed Muthusamy with a huge round of applause for winning over the infection. The DCP had tested positive on May 4. He had been supervising crowd control measures at the Koyambedu wholesale market complex, which grew to be a huge Covid cluster in the weeks to follow and was shut subsequently.

Since Muthusamy was asymptomatic, he was discharged from the hospital in four days and was sent for a home quarantine. Citing his personal experience, he said it is the kind of disease that isolates you, where your own family members cannot come anywhere near. “Only will power and psychological balance will help defeat the virus,” he said. 

As to the fact that he was put out of action for nearly two weeks, the officer said he never felt he was off duty because his colleagues were in touch with him over phone continuously. “That help boost my morale during the hard period.” He urged all Covid-19 patients to remain strong psychologically and diligently follow medical advice during their treatment. 

He said one won't be affected by Covid-19 if he or she follows all the safety guidelines. "Even if one gets infected, there is no need to panic as patients are given utmost care at the hospitals.” He also recommended the use of natural medicines like kabasura kudineer. Vishwanathan later said he was happy that infected policemen were recovering and returning to duty.
