VALPOI: As the people of the state gear up for lockdown, Bhironda-Sattari sarpanch Uday Singh Rane, took it upon himself to create awareness about the coronavirus. 


He mounted a public address system on his car and went around urging people to take precautions.

Residents of the Valpoi municipal area welcomed his move and said councillors too should adopt similar means to make people understand the gravity of the situation. 

Responding to people’s feedback, Valpoi Municipal Council (VMC) organised a vehicle mounted with loudspeakers to go around all wards urging people to stay home. 

In Copordem, Sattari, a rickshaw was similarly pressed into service.

Meanwhile, Tuesday saw people thronging Valpoi’s market to stock up on provisions as the government had permitted stores to remain open between 6am and 11am. 

The weekly Valpoi market, however, remained closed as chief officer of VMC, Rajesh Ajgaonkar, had issued a notice directing that it would not open as usual. Bagayatdars and grocery shops stayed open till 11am.
