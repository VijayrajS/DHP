2020-04-07
HYDERABAD: A person who was suspected to have contracted coronavirus sent officials in Gandhi Hospital into a tizzy after they thought he had escaped. Hours later, he was traced on another floor. The confusion was owing to the patient moving to different bed from what was assigned to him. “There was some confusion over a patient’s case sheet and taken to different floor. The patient did not make any effort to escape,” DCP (north zone) Kalmeshwar Shingenavar said.


Sources said a patient from Gadwal was admitted as Covid-19 suspect. “He moved to a different bed on Sunday instead of the allocated bed. He also switched off his mobile phone leading to confusion for some time,” sources said. The hospital staff found him sleeping on different bed. 

In fact, rumours were doing the rounds on Monday of a patient gone missing till police cleared the air that he was traced within the hospital block.
