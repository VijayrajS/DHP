2020-05-03
KOLKATA: Bengal added 15 to its tally of Covid-19 deaths over the last two days taking the toll to 48. Also, 127 new positive cases were reported in the past 48 hours, taking the total number of active cases in the state to 659, a health department bulletin for May 1 and 2 released on Saturday said.


Altogether, 45 people were discharged over the last two days after treatment, taking the total number of cured to 199. Testing count has also been substantially ramped up. On Friday, 2,410 persons were tested, taking the total test count in the state to 20,976. 

On Thursday, state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had stated that the experts’ panel set up by the government to audit the deaths had examined 105 cases and held that 33 deaths were due to Covid-19 and the rest due to serious co-morbidities. 

The Saturday bulletin also pegged the number admitted in hospital isolation at 254 and those in institutional quarantine centres at 582.

The government, which used to initially report death figures in the daily bulletin, had stopped the practice after the audit committee was set up to determine the cause of death. Thereafter, the figures were released once the committee had assessed the deaths and reported them to the state health department. However, on Thursday, the chief secretary had said the audit committee would henceforth check random death reports and not scrutinize every death. He had further said the findings of the expert committee, along with its observations, would be released to end the confusion over Covid deaths in the state.

The expert panel feels keeping detailed records of a patient’s case history and recording the chronic conditions and compromised immune system is necessary to decide the line of investigation.

The twin bulletins issued on Saturday pegged the number of persons admitted in hospital isolation at 254 and those in institutional quarantine centres at 582.
