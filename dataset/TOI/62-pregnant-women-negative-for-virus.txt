PUNE: All the 62 pregnant women, who came in contact with a coronavirus-infected radiologist in Shikrapur recently, have tested negative for Covid-19.

Pune ZP’s CEO Ayush Prasad said, “All these women are of sound health. The testing of samples was done on a war footing after we went through the difficult task of tracing each of them within 24 hours.”

The authorities are continuing their surveys in 31 villages, from where these women hail, to find out if anybody has been infected. 

The Shikrapur grampanchayat has sealed the area falling with a 3km radius of the hospital. Sarpanch Jayashree Bhujbal said, “We have made an arrangement to deliver gorcery items at homes to avoid mass gathering in the village."
