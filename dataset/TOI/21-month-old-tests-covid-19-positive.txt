KOLKATA: A 21-month-old boy, who was getting treated at the Institute of Child Health (ICH), has tested positive for Covid-19. The child is now being treated at Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital. Doctors at the Beliaghata hospital said the boy’s condition is stable.


The boy from Uttar Panchannagram off EM Bypass was taken to a Park Circus Hospital on Thursday with complaints of cough and fever. Unable to bear the complication, the child had been crying incessantly.

Doctors immediately admitted the child to the hospital’s isolation ward. An X-ray procedure of his chest carried out the next day revealed mild pneumonia, after which doctors decided on a swab test that confirmed he was Covid-19 positive. On getting the confirmatory report, the child was shifted to ID&BG Hospital for treatment.

Sources at ICH said that all the doctors and nurses involved in treating the child in the isolation ward had enough protection and, hence, none of them has been put in quarantine. The X-ray technician, however, has been advised home isolation for now. The father of the boy, too, has been put under quarantine.

Doctors said that though children are vulnerable to Covid-19, the virus is known to throw up milder symptoms in them than adults. “Many children can even be asymptomatic to the infection and, thus, they can be potential silent carriers posing a threat to elders in the family,” a city doctor said.
