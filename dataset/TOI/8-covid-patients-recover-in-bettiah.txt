2020-05-17
BETTIAH: A day after a migrant worker died in the Covid isolation ward at Bettiah’s M J K Hospital and Government Medical College, West Champaran had some encouragingly good news to celebrate on Friday when eight Covid patients undergoing treatment here were given a warm send-off with a shower of petals after testing negative.

“A week ago, two children and an adult who had been sent to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital were also discharged. The recovery of 11 patients so far is a satisfying reward for the dedication of our doctors and paramedics,” DM Kundan Kumar said. Now, 14 Covid patients remain in the isolation ward here.

“We are augmenting quarantine facilities to accommodate the rising number of migrants coming home,” the DM said. So far, 21,000 returnees have been placed in 260 quarantine camps in the blocks.

With around 2,000 to 3,000 migrants returning each day by Shramik Special trains, buses, hired vehicles, cycles and on foot, the district is seeing a 77% jump in these homecoming numbers. The administration consequently is preparing schools and other appropriate premises in each of the 319 panchayats in the district.

On Friday itself, 13 migrants reached Sanichari on cycles covering 1,300km from Tehri Garwal in Uttarakhand. Another group reached Lauriya on foot from Phillaur in Punjab. “It is good that some migrants are voluntarily getting themselves screened and quarantined,” the DM said.
