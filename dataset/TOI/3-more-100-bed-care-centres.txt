2020-05-03
AHMEDABAD: The AMC has set up three 100-bed covid care centres — in Gomtipur, Jamalpur, and near Pirana. The AMC has also decided that hotel facility will be extended to Covid warriors if they test positive and have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. This facility will also be given to the police staff on Covid duty.


Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said that mayor Bijal Patel and standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt, in consultation with him, have decided that if any Covid warrior is found positive he or she will first be offered the home quarantine option. If that is not feasible, the person will be shifted to a four-star or five-star hotel. The Covid warriors will include doctors, nurses, Class III or IV employees of the AMC, and police staff. The expenses of treatment will be borne by the AMC.

Giving details of the three new Covid care centres, Nehra said that Al Amin Garibnawaz General hospital in Gomtipur which has a 100-bed capacity has been converted into a Covid care centre. Treatment here will be free. Moreover, an infectious disease hospital has also been converted into a Covid care centre. Other patients have been transferred elsewhere.

The AMC and trustees of the Chippa community centre in Jamalpur have decided to convert it into a 100-bed Covid care centre. All the three hospitals have begun operations.

Nehra said that all citizens should now observe the lockdown for the next 14 days to get good results by May-end. “We should follow the rules and stay indoors unless it is imperative to venture out,” he said.
