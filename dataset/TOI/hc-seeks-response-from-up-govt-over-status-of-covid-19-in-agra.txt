HC seeks response from UP govt over status of Covid-19 in Agra
2020-06-14
Agra: Following a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a city-based lawyer alleging inefficiency of the district administration in containment of Covid-19, the Allahabad High Court has sought a response from the state government regarding the status of novel coronavirus in Agra district. Additional advocate general Manish Goyal has been asked to present the details before the court on June 19. 

The litigant has alleged that the district administration is doing less sampling so that fewer cases of Covid-19 are reported.

Dayalbagh resident advocate Arun Kumar Dixit said, “Following rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Agra, chief minister Yogi Adityanath sent a high-level team to check the situation in Agra and guide the local authorities regarding containment of the infection. Few days later, the team returned and after that number of fresh cases reported on a daily basis started decreasing significantly. Authorities must give an explanation about the sudden cut down on cases.”

Alleging delay in sample testing, the litigant has raised the question of people being reported Covid-19 positive after death. Discrepancies in sampling and testing of migrant labourers are also a matter of concern put forth by the litigant.

The PIL mentioned, “Despite the concerns expressed by people in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the district administration has failed in delivering its duties under the law to protect and safeguard the interest of the citizens in Agra.”

“Health of the people in Agra is at stake due to negligence and lackadaisical approach of the authorities concerned which is in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India in the current circumstances,” the PIL stated. 

So far, over 1,000 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Agra district. At least 60 people who tested Covid-19 positive have died.
