With no food in sight, destitute in Quepem worst-hit by lockdown
2020-03-26
QUEPEM: Even as most residents of Quepem were flustered about having no access to groceries on Wednesday, several homeless people were seen going house to house, begging for food. With all shops, restaurants, medical stores and petrol pumps closed on the first day of the 21-day curfew, the destitute, and ragpickers who live on the streets were caught unawares.

Citizens raised concerns about the homeless, some of them with special-needs and mental disabilities, moving around town, scavenging for food and sleeping on the roadside. While they usually manage to wrangle a meal from roadside eateries, most of them had to go hungry due to the lockdown.

However, the well-heeled also had to return empty handed when they went out of their homes looking to stock up on essentials. In Sanguem, a serpentine queue was seen at a grocery shop in the town but the police came by and shut the store down.

Those in the long queue which reached from the market area to the bus stand and beyond, said they maintained a metre’s distance from each other, yet the police didn’t allow the shop to sell essentials. Another vegetable shop was also shut down within an hour of opening.

In Quepem, some locals were frustrated over the unavailability of milk. It was a near-100 percent lock down in Quepem town and surrounding areas.

When asked whether fair price shop owners or grocery shops had approached him for curfew passes to start home delivery for essential goods, as declared by the chief minister, deputy collector of Quepem Rohit Kadam said that he did not receive any notification from the district collector in this regard.

Some shopkeepers told TOI that they are unaware about the chief minister’s announcement regarding home delivery.
