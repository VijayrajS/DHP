2020-06-11
JAIPUR: In the first 10 days of Unlock 1.0, the state has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in comparison to the four phases, individually, during the lockdown stage in the state. There has been 65 deaths in the past 10 unlock days. In comparison, there had been 15, 56, 60 and 63 deaths, respectively, in the four phases of the lockdown period.

During the same 10-day unlock period, 2,769 cases have been reported at an average of 277 per day. The increasing number of deaths and new cases during the unlock phase is giving sleepless nights to authorities which have now decided to restrict the entry of people into the state as well as leaving it.

In the last two days, the state reported more than 350 cases daily, which is happening for the first time since the outbreak. 

Collectively on Tuesday and Wednesday, 734 persons have been found infected with the virus. The pace at which the cases are increasing has alarmed the state government to take corrective measures.

Since June 5, cases are constantly increasing. On June 6, 14% more cases were reported than June 5. Similarly, there was a 3.5% increase on June 7 and 5.7% increase in cases on June 8. The percentage of increase in cases took a significant 33% jump on June 9 in comparison to June 8. However, on June 10, the cases have been slightly less in comparison to June 9, but still it is the second highest reported in a single day.

Health minister Raghu Sharma appealed to the people to follow social distancing, wear masks and to take other protective measures to prevent the risk of getting infected. “The WHO has clarified that till they have a vaccine for Covid-19, you have to protect yourself from getting infected. We are trying to find out why cases have increased recently. In Unlock 1.0 phase, any sort of carelessness can lead to risk of life for any person,” he said.
