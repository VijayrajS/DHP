PATNA: A complaint petition was filed against the Chinese President and China’s ambassador to India in a court at Muzaffarpur on Monday for putting the lives of scores of people at risk through coronavirus. The court headed by additional chief judicial magistrate cum sub-judge-I Hemant Kumar has listed the case for hearing on April 11.


The complainant, Sudhir Kumar Ojha, said novel coronavirus was first reported from China’s Wuhan city, which later engulfed other countries, including India. Ojha cited its reference in the book ‘Eyes of Darkness’ authored by Dean Koontz. “The court is likely to issue notices to the accused on the next date of hearing. The court has already taken cognizance of the matter,” he said.

Ojha said the book published in 1981 talked about a deadly virus, “Wuhan 400”, having a “kill rate” of 100% and developed in labs outside the city as the “perfect” biological weapon. There is reference of killer virus “Wuhan 400” from page number 353 to 356 of the book, which had predicted the outbreak of a killer virus, he said.

Ojha, who is known for lodging complaint cases against politicians and Bollywood actors, said the deadly virus was developed in the lab of Wuhan city to be later used as biological weapon against their enemies. “There is a larger conspiracy behind it, which needs to be properly probed,” Ojha alleged in the complaint.

The accused — Chinese President Ji Xinping and Son Weidong, China’s ambassador to India — have been booked under Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 109 (abetment of offence) and 120(B) (conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code.

According to Ojha’s complaint, a copy of which is with TOI, two persons have died and several others tested positive in India ever since the virus spread from Wuhan city.
