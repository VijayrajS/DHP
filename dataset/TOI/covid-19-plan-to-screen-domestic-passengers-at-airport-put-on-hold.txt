Covid-19: Plan to screen domestic passengers at Hyderabad airport put on hold
2020-03-11
HYDERABAD: The state health department has decided to purchase two standing thermal screening kits to be used at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) for better screening of international passengers. While the state had requested the Centre for the equipment, it decided to go ahead with the purchase since the Centre did not respond. Meanwhile, the plan for screening of domestic passengers will remain on hold for now.

“Since we had limited staff and equipment for screening, we decided to purchase the kits,” said Eatala Rajender, state health minister. “Also, 200 staff members have now been deputed (in three shifts) at the airport so that the screening is thorough. As for domestic screening, we have approached the Centre, but did not get any response. But as long as all states are having an intensive screening of international passengers, it won’t be much of a problem if domestic screening is not taken up immediately.” 


 

In addition to the existing nCovid-19 testing facility at ICMR lab in Gandhi Medical College, the Centre has approved testing at Osmania General Hospital (OGH), and will consider allowing testing at Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM), the minister said. 

He also said that the first patient who tested positive for nCovid-19 in the state (24-year-old software professional) is likely to be discharged in the next four days, since he has already tested negative once. A confirmatory test is awaited from National Institute of Virology, Pune.
