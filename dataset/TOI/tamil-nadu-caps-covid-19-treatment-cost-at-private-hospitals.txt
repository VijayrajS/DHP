Tamil Nadu caps Covid-19 treatment cost at private hospitals
2020-06-07
CHENNAI: To prevent profiteering by private hospitals, the Tamil Nadu health department has fixed treatment costs for Covid-19 patients at Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000 a day. The state wing of the Indian Medical Association has asked the state to either revise the price or take over private hospitals that are willing to offer their space instead.


A release from state health minister C Vijayabaskar said hospitals in the A3 and A4 categories – as listed on the state health insurance webpage (https:// www.cmchistn.com) – cannot charge more than Rs 5,000 a day for treatment of Covid-19 in the general ward, multi-specialty hospitals in A1 and A2 category can’t charge beyond Rs 7,500. For treatment in ICU, hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 15,000. “Legal action will be initiated against hospitals that charge more than the prescribed fee,” he said.



Earlier this week, Vijayabaskar had said the government had received complaints that hospitals were fleecing patients. Minutes after the state released the tariff norms, IMA state secretary Dr AK Ravikumar said the doctors association will make a representation for revision. “We will not be able to run the wards at that rate. Many hospital owners are telling us that they are ready to give the Covid beds to the state government. We will just work for them,” he said.

Analysis of bills by TOI showed that a Covid-19 patient who stayed for 10 days in a semi-private room of a hospital in Chennai spent Rs 1,081 towards medicines and Rs 2,550 for blood tests and x-ray. But the patient had to pay Rs 2,500 for “other packages” and Rs 44,000 towards consultation, Rs 8,800 towards nursing charges, Rs 20,000 towards room rent. The cost towards PPE for doctors and other healthcare workers was Rs 1.01 lakh out of the Rs 1.80 lakh bill. “On an average we need at least nine PPEs per patient. There is an additional cost when we have to quarantine staff on Covid-19 duty,” Dr Ravikumar said.

The state health department said it was willing to help hospitals procure PPEs at government rates if they are willing to pass on the benefit to the patients. Two days ago, the state brought treatment of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals under the chief minister’s health insurance scheme, which covers more than 1.57 crore people.

Treatment at all government hospitals continues to remain free, officials said.
