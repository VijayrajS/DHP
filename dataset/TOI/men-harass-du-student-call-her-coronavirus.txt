The woman in her compliant to the police stated that she resides in Jawahar Nagar with her friend. Police said the incident occurred on Friday when two youths on a two-wheeler threw a balloon at her and called her coronavirus. Based on her complaint, a case was registered at Roop Nagar police station.

“We are trying to identify the route of the accused youths through CCTV footage. The victim is yet to contact the investigating officer of the case,” said a senior police officer.
