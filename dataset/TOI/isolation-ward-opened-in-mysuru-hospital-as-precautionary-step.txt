MYSURU: Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar has directed the health officials to take all measures to prevent coronavirus in the district. Speaking to reporters after a video conference with the chief secretary at the DC’s office on Friday, Abhiram said there has been no positive case of coronavirus in the district. 


“We are only getting reports of virus from China, UAE, Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Nepal. As there is a possibility that those persons who have returned from foreign countries are infected with virus, the district health department is keeping them and their family members under observation for two weeks. Till date, no person with the symptoms were found in the district,” he said. 

Abhiram said that a 10-bed isolation ward had been opened in KR Hospital. “Five beds with ventilators have also been arranged in KR Hospital for treating virus-infected persons. Screening of passengers at Mysuru, Bengaluru and Mangaluru airports is being done and the information is being exchanged,” he said. 

Reacting to reports of shortage of surgical masks in the market, the deputy commissioner requested the public not to fall for rumours being spread. “People should not panic. There are enough masks available for the people. There is no case reported in Mysuru and people should not panic by spreading messages through social network sites,” he said.

He added that the district administration and health department are spreading awareness on the virus and precautionary measures which had to be taken to prevent the virus. 

District health officer Venkatesh, RCH officer Dr Ravi, DTO P Ravi and DDPI Panduranga were present.
