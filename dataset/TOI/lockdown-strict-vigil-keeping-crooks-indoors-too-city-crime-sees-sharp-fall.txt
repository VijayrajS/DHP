Prayagraj: The fear of contracting the deadly virus and the sea of khaki on roads in the wake of the lockdown is keeping crooks indoors too. Police data between April 1 and 15 indicated a fall in various crimes like murders, kidnapping and dacoity. 

According to the data released on Sunday, auto-theft cases registered a sharp decline of around 90%, when compared to the data from 2019 of the same period. Only seven cases of auto theft were reported in Prayagrraj during the 15-day period, against the 67 cases recorded in April 1-15, 2019. 

Street crimes like purse snatching and petty fights also showed a dip of 30% and 50% respectively, as compared to the corresponding figure for last year. With most residents staying indoors, crimes like burglary have come down from 87 cases in 2019 to 17 at present. 

SSP (Prayagraj) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said the number of cases of crimes like loot, snatching, auto-theft, rioting and kidnapping has declined by a large scale during the lockdown.

“407 cases under different sections of the Indian Pencal Code were registered at different police stations of the district from April 1-15 this year, while 643 cases were registered during the same period last year,” he added.

“Police are strictly enforcing the lockdown. Moreover, round-the-clock vigil, intensified patrolling and aerial monitoring via drones have deterred criminal activities by a large extent,” said a senior police official.

Other crimes like rape and cases of molestation, have dipped by nearly 50 % as people to people contact has reduced by a great extent.

Police have challaned 32,942 persons between April 1 and 15 this year for violating the Motor Vehicle Act, against 4,794 last year.
