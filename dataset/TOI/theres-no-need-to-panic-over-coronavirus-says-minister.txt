MANGALURU: In the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak in China and some reported cases in India, district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari said that there is no need for the public to panic over the issue, but advised people to take precautionary measures.

The minister addressed an emergency meeting at the deputy commissioner’s office on Wednesday. He said that no coronavirus case has been reported in the state so far. Since a case has been reported in neighbouring Kasargod, the district administration has put in place precautionary measures. In case of any doubts, he requested the public to contact the health department helpline number 104. The district administration is prepared to meet any contingency, Poojari said. 

Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh said provisions have been made for health checkups at prominent entry points like railway stations and the airport. Since there is no direct flight from China to Mangaluru, there is no reason to panic. However, two people who returned from China recently have undergone health checkups, and no symptoms of the disease were found on them, she said. 

NMPT officers said that three Chinese nationals were not allowed to alight from the cruise vessel that arrived at the New Mangaluru Port on Tuesday.
