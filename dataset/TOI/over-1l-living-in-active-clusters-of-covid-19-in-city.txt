Health authorities have identified as many as 146 active clusters within the municipal limits of Aurangabad where a total of 21,587 houses are located. As per 2011 census, Aurangabad had a population of 11.75 lakh which means that close to around 10% of the city’s population is living in active clusters during the ongoing pandemic. 

As per official data, at 108, the cluster involving Mukundwadi, Sanjay Nagar and Rohidas Nagar has the highest number of patients and population of 2,191 living in 544 houses.

“While densely populated localities have relatively larger concentration of Covid-19 patients, plush localities such as CIDCO, Garkheda and Ulka Nagari have also reported cases related to the contagion. Over two-third of city area has witnessed the spread of the Covid-19 going by the presence of active clusters in different parts of the city and outskirts,” a senior health department official said.

Acting on the directives of the government, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) — as a precautionary measure — has been spraying disinfectant in different parts of the city, especially areas from where confirmed cases of Covid-19 are emerging.

“The disinfectant, Sodium Hypochorite, is being used in high quantity in active clusters on a regular basis,” a civic official said.

Divisional government authorities said 374 teams have been deployed in different clusters for necessary support as well as to ensure compliance of the lockdown norms. 

“Going by the drop in daily cases of Covid-19, we may see flattening of coronavirus curve in Aurangabad shortly if public at large extend their cooperation with the district administration and health authorities. Avoiding crowded places unless necessary, following social distancing norm and maintaining personal hygiene are key to combat the spread of Covid-19,” authorities concerned said.

With addition of 16 new cases on Monday, the confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Aurangabad went up to 1,301 on Monday morning.
