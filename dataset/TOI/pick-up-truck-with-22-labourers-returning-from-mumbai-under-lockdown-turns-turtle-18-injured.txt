MEERUT: A group of 22 workers — returning home from Mumbai after they were rendered jobless in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown in the metropolis — met with an accident after the pick-up truck they had hired for their travel turned turtle late night on Sunday.


The accident happened between villages Chittora and Kawal in Jansath region of Muzaffarnagar. They had taken the Dehradun Express from Mumbai, and had alighted from it at Muzaffarnagar on Sunday afternoon.

According to police sources, 18 of the labourers were badly injured and had to be admitted to district hospital. Most of them were residents of Bijnor. According to Mohd Alam, one of the victims, “We are all dead tired and had dozed off, when all of a sudden there was a massive blast and the truck lost balance. It all happened within seconds.” 

Jansath police station in-charge Yogesh Verma told TOI, “The accident occurred after a tyre burst. All are residents of Bijnor district. They were immediately taken to hospital. No FIR was lodged.”
