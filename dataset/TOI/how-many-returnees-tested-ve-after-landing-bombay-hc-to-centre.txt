How many returnees tested Covid-19 positive after landing: Bombay HC to Centre
2020-06-03
MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday asked the Central government how many passengers who returned on the Vande Bharat Mission tested positive for Covid19 after landing, but had not been infected when they boarded the special flight.The HC sought a data of such passengers by Wednesday evening.

Air India pilot, Deven Kanani had petitioned the HC to ensure vacant middle seats. His counsel Abhilash Panickar argued AI had violated social distancing norms while evacuating Indians.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre and AI assured compliance of safety norms.

He said the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had on May 31, already directed airlines to keep the middle seat vacant or give additional protective gear to such occupant. The DGCA said, it was “wrong to say that these flights are bringing infected persons in contact with healthy individuals.'’

It said the March 23 circular was not meant for non-scheduled operations of “evacuation flights operated by Air India under the Vande Bharat Mission,’’ for which separate SOPs were issued home and civil aviation ministries. “Physical distancing onboard aircraft by keeping empty seat between two passengers may not prevent the spread of virus,’’ said the DGCA.

Air India, in its affidavit denied any death of cabin crew, but said only one ‘casual employee’ in Mumbai, not in contact with passengers had died in hospital on May 18.

The AI said 21 cabin crew tested positive out of 5000 tested, by May 29. It added that 70,000 Indians are to be brough back by June 16 and another 85,000 in the third phase. Over 6.5 lakh Indians stranded abroad in over 120 countries have reached out to be rescued it said.
