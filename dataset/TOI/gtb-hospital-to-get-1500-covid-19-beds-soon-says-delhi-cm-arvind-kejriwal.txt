NEW DELHI: The number of beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients in government and private hospitals is likely to reach 8,500 in the next couple of days with the Delhi government setting up a 1,500-bed facility at the state-run Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in east Delhi.


It will be the second largest Covid-designated health facility in Delhi after Lok Nayak Hospital, which has 2,000 beds. All beds will also have oxygen facility to take care of severe patients.

The 8,500 beds also include the 2,000 being earmarked in 117 private health facilities. With 3,500 new beds and 2,500 of 4,500 currently unoccupied in 13 government and private hospitals, CM Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi government was equipped to handle a sudden surge in corona positive cases.


 


He also said the government was developing a new system to bring live information on vacant beds available in each hospital in public domain to ensure that people know which hospital to go in case a patient is required to be taken to a government facility. “The system would be ready in 2-3 days,” Kejriwal said.

Sources said there have been several instances in the past where the families of Covid-19 positive cases were forced to go from one hospital to the other looking for a bed or ventilator for the infected person.

Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said the government had expected a sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases with the announcement of more relaxations in the lockdown to restart economic activities on May 17. In the past one week, Kejriwal said, about 3,500 new cases emerged in the capital while 2,500 patients had recovered. While there were 9,755 corona cases in Delhi on May 17, the number had risen to 13,418 on Sunday with a rise of around 3,500 patients in one week. Of 13,418 cases, Kejriwal said 6,617 were active, 6,540 had recovered while 261 deaths had been reported.

While the situation was currently in “control”, Kejriwal accepted that it may get difficult if there was a surge in serious patients. “It has been a week since some relaxations are given in the lockdown on May 17 but the situation seems to be under control. However, there will be a trouble if the number of severe patients increases to the extent that there is a non-availability of beds, oxygen, ventilators and other healthcare infrastructure,” the CM said.

According to government functionaries, there are over 3,800 beds (about 3,180 with oxygen) currently available in five government facilities — both state-run and Centre’s combined — and nearly 670 in private health facilities in the capital.

While only a few beds are left unoccupied in private hospitals, 2,500 beds in government-run facilities are still available. The addition of a GTB Hospital and 2,000-odd beds in private facilities will further improve the situation, said officials. Officials said the government was in the process of adding more beds.

Kejriwal also said that only a few ventilators — 11 of 250 in government and 15 of 72 in private hospitals — were currently being used for Covid-19 positive patients while 3,314 patients with mild symptoms were being treated at home.

“Most of the new cases of Covid-19 have mild symptoms and many of them are asymptomatic. These cases do not need to be admitted in hospitals and advised to be home isolated. Our health teams are in regular touch with them and their families,” the CM added.

BJP on Sunday had slammed the AAP government for not making public the information on the exact number of available beds for Covid-19 patients. The opposition had alleged that the number of beds was inadequate to treat the large number of patients and several of them were forced to stay at home.

The CM also warned hospitals of stern action if they denied treatment to any Corona positive patient.

"We have served showcause notice to a private hospital for denying treatment to a patient who had admitted for breathing issues and later tested positive for corona,” Kejriwal said.
