GHAZIABAD: While Delhi-NCR is grappling with Covid-19 scare, Ghaziabad has been hit by H1N1 influenza, popularly known as swine flu. 


According to health officials, three cases were reported in Indirapuram on Sunday. They said all those affected are women and they are “stable”. Meanwhile, the family members of the patients have been advised to take all precautions.

Recently, the health department had received information about six persons suffering from swine flu, after which their samples were taken for tests. Later, reports of three women were found to be positive, while the remaining three did not have swine flu. At the time of sample collection, they were all down with fever. Health officials said the three have been asked to stay at home and take medical advice.

Last year, 337 cases of swine flu were reported from the district. One person from Niwadi had lost his life. There was no case in 2018.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, swab samples of two Ghaziabad residents — one from Sanjay Nagar and another from Indirapuram — were collected for coronavirus testing.

They called and informed us that they had come in contact with a person who had the virus and insisted that we collect his samples.”

We have collected 27 samples so far and 14 have been found to be negative and one was tested positive. Reports of the remaining 12 are awaited. 

According to Gupta, the wife of a 57-year-old businessman from Rajnagar Extension, who was found to be suffering from coronavirus, has been tested negative. Meanwhile, the condition of the businessman admitted to RML hospital, is improving. He has bene shifted to Safdarjung hospital.
