NEW DELHI: Congress Sunday asked the government if it has a national plan ready for post-lockdown period and if Prime Minister Narendra Modi will share it with the chief ministers in the meeting on Monday. The party also asked the government if it was deliberately keeping the testing levels low for fear of consequences.

Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said coronavirus is here to stay and the government needs to have a holistic programme on dealing with the pandemic and reviving the economy. He said the Disaster Management Act that the Centre has invoked enjoins upon the government to craft a national plan to deal with natural disasters or pandemics.

“It is a germane issue because till the time a national plan is put in public domain, the states or district administrations will not be able to formulate their plans to deal with the crisis,” he said.

Former PM Manmohan Singh said without aggressive testing facilities, India cannot conquer challenges posed by Covid-19. “There are problems with regard to the inadequacy of testing facilities and without more aggressive facilities of testing, we are not going to conquer this menace," Singh said.

Tewari added that testing remains low in India despite global evidence that aggressive testing is the only way to deal with the pandemic, adding that even India’s neighbours are faring better on this crucial front.

Asserting that India has a testing capacity of one lakh per day, he asked what was the reason to keep it at 39,000 per day. “Is it to play down the pandemic spread in India or whether the government thinks that if testing goes to capacity, it cannot deal with its implications? Either way, the government needs to tell people why is it not testing to full potential,” Tewari asked.
