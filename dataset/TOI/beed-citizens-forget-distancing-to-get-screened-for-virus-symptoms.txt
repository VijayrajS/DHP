Beed citizens forget distancing to get screened for virus symptoms
2020-05-11
Aurangabad: A medical camp organised in Beed to monitor the health of the citizens and identify Covid-19 suspects took an unfortunate turn when it defeated the purpose for which it was set up on Sunday. NGO Gopinath Munde Pratishthan, under former minister Pankaja Munde and MP Pritam Munde, has facilitated a ward-wise health check-ups for Beed residents for the last 32 days. The NGO has roped in private doctors, who check locals for symptoms of Covid-19 and also for diabetes and blood pressure. Though the district is currently in the green zone with no positive Covid-19 cases, the initiative was implemented to ensure no one contracts Covid-19 and the district continues to remain free of the viral infection. Those found with high body temperature, cold or cough were referred to the district civil hospital. According to district president of Gopinath Munde Pratishthan Rajendra Mhaske, more than 80,000 people have undergone primary check up at the medical camp. Around 2,000 people were checked at the Gandhinagar area in Beed on Sunday alone. A large number of men, women and children were checked at the medical camp. However, the citizens failed to observe social distancing at the camp. People were standing less than a feet away from each other and many were spotted without masks, thereby defeating the purpose of the medical camp and exposing the people to the risk of infection. The organiser failed to ensure people stand atleast a metre away from each other— the distance recommended by the government for preventing spread of Covid-19. Mhaske ruled out the possibility of violation of social distancing norms at the medical camp. “The camp will continue for a few more day. We will ensure that the citizens follow distancing norms,” he said. Mhaske added that the camp has now been extended to the rural areas of the district.
