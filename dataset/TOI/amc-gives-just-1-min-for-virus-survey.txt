Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation gives just 1 min for virus survey
2020-04-04
AHMEDABAD: When the entire world is under the grip of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the city civic body — Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) seems to be haste. Its health workers have been given a task of surveying 200 persons in just four hours. This means just one minute is given to inquire whether a person has any symptoms of Covid-19. 

The urban health society for AMC had last week conducted recruitment for 354 sanitation officers and the same number of medical officers for urban health clinic. For this, nearly 1,100 had opted for posts of sanitation officers and 94 applied for posts of medical officers. 

Later, all the applicants who had opted for sanitation officers' posts were hired and given the task of surveying the people. 

“We are told to finish 200 persons at least in four hours. One cannot even write a person's name and address in a minute, so how it is possible to survey about this pandemic?" asked a fresh recruit.

A sanitation officer told TOI that they are not given any hand sanitizer, hand gloves or masks by the civic body. 

He said they are also facing situations where people think that the surveyor will arrange some financial aid or food for them. 

“When we went to Chandlodia area for survey, a group of desperate people rushed to us seeking money or food. Thus, the idea of maintaining social distance collapsed,” he said. Similarly, survey was conducted in the Odhav area of city where sanitation officers just asked whether any family members suffered from cold or cough and counted the number of family members before concluding their survey.
