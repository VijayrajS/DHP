Rajkot: Five junior resident doctors of Junagadh Civil Hospital resigned on Tuesday evening after they were transferred to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital’s Covid-19 ward. However, their resignations are yet to be accepted by authorities at the Junagadh Medical College.The doctors who resigned include Dr Gautam Vekaria, Dr Hetal Karamta, Dr Prem Gangdev, Dr Sandip Vala and Dr Himanshu Ramchandani. They are all MBBS and expressed their reservations to join duty at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital.Dean of Junagadh Medical Collge S P Rathod told TOI, “I have sought guidance of health ministry on their resignations. Because if we accept the resignation they are required to serve only seven-day notice period.”Of the five, three doctors stated that they were likely to get selected for the post graduate course and if they joined duty at the Covid hospital in Ahmedabad it would be difficult for them to take part in the selection process. This is because they will have to remain in isolation for two weeks after being relieved from Ahmedabad hospital.
