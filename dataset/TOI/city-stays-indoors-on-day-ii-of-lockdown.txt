City stays indoors on Day II of lockdown
2020-03-24
Bhubaneswar: Streets in the capital and seven other towns wore a deserted look on Monday in view of the lockdown imposed by the government to ensure social distancing. This is the second day of the week-long lockdown that began with the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday.

Huge police deployment was seen in many places including arteries, routes leading to markets, national highways, VIP lanes and roads connecting places of tourist interest to keep people away. Even those on two-wheelers were stopped by police and allowed to carry on only after they provided a suitable reason for being out. 

The BMC officials engaged in emergency services were provided with passes so that they are not stopped by police. “The passes have been issued to the enforcement squad and other employees engaged in emergency services,” said a BMC spokesperson.

“It is a challenge to ensure lockdown while making sure people get emergency services,” said commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi. tnn
