BHOPAL: After coming into contact with a Covid-19 positive patient, seven doctors at Gandhi Medical College (GMC) here in the state capital have been issued showcause notice by the medical college administration. 

It is the first such notice to doctors, after recent directorate of medical education (DME) guidelines on Covid-19 and protocols for medicos at hospitals and on campus. Doctors in the largest tertiary care hospital of Madhya Pradesh have indicated their apprehension over the guidelines. 

“If the doctors do not take care, what do we expect from the general public. If the doctors themselves go into quarantine in such a way, who will look after the patients. Not wearing masks and not adhering to social distancing is no less a criminal offence,” said GMC dean and Hamidia hospital superintendent Dr A K Shrivastava. 

The seven doctors, all males, were found to be with a Covid-19 positive doctor without protective gear and precautions. The 27-year-old doctor has since been shifted to Chirayu hospital for treatment. The seven doctors are now under quarantine. Their trace contacts are also expected to be sent into quarantine.

“So far, 16 medicos of GMC have tested positive for coronavirus. Almost 100 doctors and other staff have gone into quarantine. This showcause notice will serve as a stern warning and example for others”, said Dr Shrivastava. The notice to the seven doctors was issued on Saturday. They had to submit their reply within two day. On Monday, the administration had not received any reply, he added. 

They have been asked to respond to the allegations that they were with coronavirus positive doctor after meeting in a medical ward on May 7. They spent about two hours with the infected doctor, without wearing any protective gear in room number 79 of hostel block F. It is not clear how the Covid-19 positive doctor was present in the hostel block. 

The notice, cited DME guidelines for the need of social distancing and wearing protective gear for the medicos. It also termed the situation as one of gross negligence and lack of discipline. The doctors have since been categorised as ‘high risk’ for the deadly virus.
