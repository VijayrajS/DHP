KOLHAPUR: Ashwini Patil, the woman from Satara who had been stranded in China’s Wuhan since the coronavirus outbreak, and five others from the state will be among 90 Indians to be evacuated late on Wednesday night.

At the time of filing the report on Wednesday evening, Ashwini had already reached the Wuhan-based international airport. Ashwini confirmed via WhatsApp that she was awaiting further formalities at the airport.

On Wednesday morning, she had tweeted: “At least we have clearance from the Chinese government. We will be evacuated today. See you all soon.”

She said all the evacuees have been informed about the quarantine period and other formalities that they have to undergo once they land in India.

Ashwini had been stranded in her flat since February 7 and was managing alone with limited resources. She had moved to Wuhan in June 2019 with her Polish husband Alan Goldmann. Alan had to leave Wuhan as he had developed an ear infection and needed urgent medical attention.

Apart from Ashwini, other citizens of the state stranded in Wuhan are from Latur, Jalgaon, Dhule, Ahmednagar, and Kolhapur. However, they are not willing to interact with the media.

Earlier, in a series of tweets on February 17, the Indian embassy in China had stated: “GoI will send a consignment of medical supplies on a relief flight to Wuhan later this week to support China to fight the COVID-19 epidemic. On its return, the flight will have limited capacity to take on board Indians wishing to return to India from Wuhan/Hubei.”

Subsequently, the embassy had attributed the delay to the Chinese government, which had not given clearance to the Indian Air Force’s biggest aircraft — C-17 Globemaster — that was to be sent with medical supplies as well as to evacuate the Indians stranded in Wuhan.
