Surat: The Bharuch district administration was caught unawares after a bus carrying about 25 people, mostly students from Mauritius, arrived in Bharuch under the Vande Bharat Mission for free quarantine facility.

Official sources said that the group were mostly residents from Surat and Navsari district and had landed at the Mumbai airport on Thursday. They were sent in a bus from Mumbai for the free quarantine facility in Bharuch. 

However, the Bharuch administration had already intimated the authorities in Mumbai that they had run out of the free quarantine facility. 

Talking with TOI, district collector of Bharuch, Dr M D Modiya said, “As per the government policy, people coming from foreign countries must have to stay in the quarantine facility in districts other then their home district. We had intimated to the concerned officials at Mumbai that we do not have free quarantine facility. Despite of this the people were sent to Bharuch.”

Dr Modiya added, “The passenger had left the bus in Bharuch and demanded they be kept in the free facility. However, we arranged a bus and sent them to Vadodara for the free quarantine facility.” 

Vicky Makwana, one of the passengers, hailing from Surat said, “We were not knowing the government protocols. We were made to pay Rs 2,600 bus fare per passenger from Mumbai to Bharuch. When we arrived here we were told that they do not have free quarantine facility available. Other passengers went to Vadodara, while I chose to stay in the paid hotel facility for quarantine.” 

Makwana, who is newly married and had gone for honeymoon in Mauritius and had got stranded there due to the closure of international flights to India.
