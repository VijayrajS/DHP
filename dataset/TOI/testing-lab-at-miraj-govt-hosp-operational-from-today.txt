Kolhapur: The newly installed Covid-19 testing lab at the Miraj Government Medical College is all set to begin operations from Friday.Sangli district civil surgeon Sanjay Salunkhe said the quality-control test of the lab was successful and the lab would begin operations by testing samples from within the district. “We would like to be on the front foot with qualitative measures instead of quantitative ones. As our staff gets familiar with the machine and its operation, we can start taking samples from other districts too,” said Salunkhe.Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary told TOI that he had not been able to do a follow-up of the testing lab due to his busy schedule. “For now,we will test the samples from Miraj for a few days. Samples from other districts will be accepted after two to three days,” said Chaudhari.State minister for health Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar said that once the machine provided to Miraj Government Medical College by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is ready for use, it would be able to test 50 swab samples at any given time. The machine at the testing lab will provide speedy results of the throat swab samples. Once functional, the swab samples of the suspected Covid-19 cases from Sangli, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, Satara and Sindhudurg districts can be sent to Miraj Government Medical College for testing. The officials from the Satara health department said for them, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune was closer and that they would continue to send their samples to the NIV.
