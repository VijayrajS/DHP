2020-01-23
Kolkata: The state’s referral hospital for infectious diseases, ID Hospital Beliaghata, has kept its isolation ward ready amid a scare over coronavirus. A team from Swasthya Bhawan, the state’s health headquarters, on Wednesday inspected the wards and checked the preparedness of the hospital.

“We have kept our isolation ward prepared in case we get any coronavirus patient. Our medical team is ready as well,” said Anima Halder, principal at ID Hospital Beliaghata.

The hospital already has two specialised isolation wards, each with eight beds, one for Nipa and the other for Ebola virus. These wards will be utilised in case the city gets any coronavirus case. The hospital management, however, conveyed to the team from Swasthya Bhawan that more nursing staff would be required in case an actual outbreak takes place or even to tackle a few cases.
