‘Pvt schools not to cut salaries of teachers during lockdown’
2020-03-28
Jaipur: The education department has issued orders to the private schools asking them not to cut salaries of teachers during lockdown.

The orders were issued on the basis of complaints received by the department from school teachers, who were informed by the school managements that they will be paid on the basis of the number of days they come to school.

Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra on Friday said these orders must be strictly implemented. “No educational institute can cut salaries of teachers. If any school violates the orders, the district collector can take action,” Dotasra said.

Schools have been shut for the last two weeks due to the spread of coronavirus. Many schools were in the middle of conducting their exams.

Sourabh Swami, director, secondary education, Bikaner, said mostly small schools are involved in such act. “Schools who usually change their teachers every three months are likely to be involved in this. In bigger schools, teachers are valued a lot. But in any case, action will be taken against violators. Orders have been issued after many complaints have been received by the district education officers that teachers have been informed by the school authorities about the cut in monthly salary,” Swami said.
