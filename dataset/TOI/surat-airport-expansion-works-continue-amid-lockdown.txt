SURAT: Even though the domestic and international flight operations have been suspended due to the lockdown, it has not deterred the Surat airport authorities from completing the critical infrastructure project related to the expansion of the existing terminal building.


Engineers and team of more than 50 construction workers are working under the guidance of the senior airport officials to ensure that the foundation work of the terminal expansion project is completed before the monsoon season.

“Completing the foundation work for the terminal expansion project before monsoon is crucial. After the lockdown was announced, we consulted our engineers and they showed their willingness to complete the work in the time bound manner,” said airport director, Aman Saini.

“We are taking utmost care of the construction workers and the engineers who are working at the site. The construction workers have been given shelter in the airport premises and they are regularly screened and provided with medical assistance on regular basis. The social distancing guidelines and safety measure are being strictly followed at the site,” he added.

The expansion of the terminal building at the cost of Rs 350 crore was approved by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) following the growth in the passenger traffic from Surat airport over the last two years. Against the present capacity of the existing terminal building to handle 500 peak hour passengers, the passenger traffic has crossed 4,000 per day.

The existing terminal building has an area of 8,474 square metre that will be extended by additional 17,046 square metre (excluding City Side and air side kerb) to have a total area of 25, 520 square metre.

After the extension, the terminal building will be capable to handle (1200 Domestic + 600 International) i.e. 1800 passenger during the peak hours. Surat Airport then, will be able to handle 2.6 million passengers annually.
