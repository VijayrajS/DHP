HYDERABAD: Three more government labs began testing for the novel coronavirus in the last two days. Gandhi Hospital and Osmania Medical College in Hyderabad have already been conducting the tests. Apart from this, the Indian Council of Medical Research has authorised five private labs in Hyderabad to conduct Covid-19 tests.


Fever Hospital, NIMS and Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) began taking the samples and doing the coronavirus tests. In Fever Hospital, out of 20 samples tested, two came positive on Thursday and Friday. IPM test results are being sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for further confirmation, Fever Hospital superintendent Dr K Shankar, who is also in-charge of IPM, said. 

However, the private labs though having real-Time PCR equipment and imported testing kits have been asked to wait till the Telangana government issues separate orders.

Director of public health Dr G Srinivasva Rao told TOI, “We are going issue guidelines for coronavirus testing to private labs. As it is an infectious disease, we need to have surveillance and reporting. We have enough kits even if we get more samples.”

He said hospitals should collect nasal and throat swab samples of suspect cases and send them to labs. 

Director of medical education Ramesh Reddy said MGM Hospital in Warangal will also soon start taking the samples and testing them. “The tests will be sent to NIV, Pune, and confirmed. ICMR is sending the testing kits,” he said.

He said the spike in the positive cases in Telangana has got nothing to do with increased testing but is related to more samples being collected.

Apollo Hospitals said it would start conducting the tests once the state government issues guidelines. Vijaya Diagnostics Centre, which was also allowed by the Centre to conduct he tests, said it would collect Rs 4,500 per test. The tests would be done only at its Somajiguda centre.
