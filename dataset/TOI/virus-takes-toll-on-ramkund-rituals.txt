Virus takes toll on Ramkund rituals
2020-03-23
Nashik: Hindu religious rituals at the sacred Ramkund, on the banks of the Godavari river in Nashik city, have seen a big dip due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

On Sunday, during the nationwide janata curfew, Ramkund did not see a single ritual being performed — an unprecedented event in the site’s history.

The Nashik Purohit Sangh said only about 50 rituals are taking place along the river’s banks every day now.

“A total of 350 priests, who are associated with the group, usually perform about 500 different types of rituals daily. But since the outbreak, that number has dropped drastically,” Satish Shukla, the president of the Purohit Sangh, told TOI.

Priests said there has been a substantial impact on earnings.

“We are now only performing rituals that are mandatory. For example, those after death,” said Shukla.

“If there is a death in someone’s family, they have to immerse ashes in the river. That involves a puja. Another ritual is also performed 10 or 13 days after a person’s death. These are the only mandatory pujas that need to be done,” he added.

The Purohit Sangh has also cancelled bookings by devotees from other states. “We do not want to put anyone’s life at risk. One person from Kolkata had booked time for a puja two months ago. But we had to cancel the booking. Those who stay in Nashik or nearby locations are the ones coming to perform mandatory or urgent rites,” Shulka said.

Mumbai resident Vikas Tiwari, who was in the city on Saturday with family to perform the last rites of his father, said he had no other option but visit Ramkund. He returned after completion of the rituals.
