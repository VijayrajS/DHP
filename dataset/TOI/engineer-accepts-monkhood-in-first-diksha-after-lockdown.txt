Engineer accepts monkhood in first Diksha after lockdown

SURAT: While the global pandemic has forced everybody to rethink their lives and its meaning, this Surti engineer was determined to renounce the materialistic path altogether.

Following in the footsteps of his younger brother, Pujit, who accepted monkhood and became Saumya Chandra Maharaj around seven years ago, 28-year-old civil engineer Dhiren Shah, a resident of Gopipura, had been practicing to be a monk for the past one year.

His dream came true on Wednesday at a small event held in Pal area of city and became the first person to adopt monkhood after the lockdown. In the presence of 35 family members Dhiren became Munishree Samitchandra Vijayji under the guidance of Shree Vijay Shramanchandra Suriswarji Maharaj. 

Son of a scrap businessman, Vastupal, who runs a metal scrap shop, Dhiren had always lived a simple life since his childhood. He had completed his engineering studies from Vallabh Vidhya Nagar. After finishing studies he had joined a city-based building construction group and also worked for a few years. 

“All of us are religious, but Dhiren was highly influenced by our younger brother who accepted monkhood at the age of 18 years. He was disturbed due to violence he observed around him and had been spending a lot of time with his guru preparing himself,” said Dharmin, elder brother of Dhiren. 

Earlier the Diksha event was scheduled in Mumbai on April 26 but due to lockdown it could not be held. Soon after the restrictions were eased, Dhiren took Diksha at an event held at the Ram Pavan Bhumi in Pal in presence of a few family members. 

In his dikshant address, the new monk said, “I realised that the truth is control and simplicity and not materialistic gains. Hence, I decided to walk on this path.”
