Gandhi hosp’s Covid-19 exclusivity tough pill to swallow for doctors
2020-05-21
Hyderabad: Doctors at the nodal Gandhi Hospital are finding it increasingly hard to digest the prolonged use of the hospital only for Covid-19 treatment. The doctors have been at the forefront in the fight against novel coronavirus for two months now. 

Several medicos have even represented to the government that their academic cycle has taken a beating as the entire hospital has only Covid-19 wards now. “PG doctors have their exams and they need to learn from various faculties the treatment of various ailments. But that’s not happening now,” a medico pointed out. 

Senior doctors are also upset as the hospital has been reduced to treating only Covid-19 patients. “Poor patients from various parts of the state come to Gandhi for free treatment. But, they are forced to go to other hospitals now,” a doctor explained.

Gandhi Hospital has been designated as the nodal Covid-19 hospital in Telangana to treat at least 1,000 coronavirus patients. Though King Koti, Nature Cure and four other hospitals are also treating Covid-19 patients, Gandhi has been in the forefront in the battle against the pandemic. 

The medical and health authorities have been saying that the government is firm that only after the bed capacity gets exhausted at Gandhi, doctors can refer Covid-19 patients to other hospitals and those attached to private medical colleges. But, this has not gone down well with the doctors at Gandhi. Not just doctors from Gandhi, even those in other government and private hospitals are in a tight spot on the prolonged treatment to the infected patients.
