GUWAHATI: A mother is known to put her love for her children above everything else. But, when a healthy mother stays back with her Covid-19 positive daughter at an isolation ward, love then is heavenly.


On Thursday, this mother’s love shook the entire Assam government and they could not say no to the mother’s decision to remain besides her 13-year-old daughter, who had a heart surgery not long back in Mumbai. Rules were bent, for the first time for a mother.

The duo had just returned from Mumbai by a bus along with 130 other people, mostly cancer patients, and their attendants on Tuesday and were quarantined in Guwahati. 

On Thursday, when the test results came, it turned out that daughter was a positive but her mother was fit and healthy. As per the protocol, the positive person has to be isolated immediately in a hospital, but that did not happen here.

“For the first time, we have allowed a negative persons to stay with a positive patient in one room in a hospital. Here is a mother who knows very well that she has high chance of getting infected with the virus and yet she refused to part with her daughter. This is an extraordinary example of motherly love,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

The duo have been brought to Guwahati Medical College and Hospital and have been given a separate cabin away from the isolation ward for the coronavirus positive people. “Cardiologists are also keeping watch on the child and working with the core team for Covid,” Sarma added.
