BHOPAL: Almost 68% of all the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Madhya Pradesh are below the age of 50, according to age-wise distribution of cases in Madhya Pradesh done by government-backed Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Good Governance and Policy Analysis. This analysis is a warning and beats the popular perception that elderly are more vulnerable to COVID-19.


The study looks into age, sex of coronavirus positive cases and deaths. It does not reveal base demographic characteristics such as pre-existing conditions. The data source is from MoHFW, MP health department and a crowd sourcing website, which is not linked to government. 



According to this analysis, almost 50 per cent of these positive patients were in the age-group of 30 to 50. The ‘situation report’ for MP department of health and family welfare was released on Monday. It also highlights another alarming statistics. Reason-wise distribution of cases in Madhya Pradesh (traveller versus contact transmission) indicates that reason for infection in 49% cases was unknown. Among known cases, those who had no travel history were 34% and travellers were 17% . The study is based on data of 47 cases.

First case was reported on March 20; since then MP has reported steady increase in COVID-19 cases. The total number of people who are under the scanner are well over 12,000 according to government data.

More than a dozen people who are tagged for foreign travel to COVID-19 affected regions are currently not in MP. These are MP residents and have valid passports. Various measures have been taken by the state government, seeking people’s participation, to track these people. A minimum quarantine period of 14-days is required following foreign travel.
