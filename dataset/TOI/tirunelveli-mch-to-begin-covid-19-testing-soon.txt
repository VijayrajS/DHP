“We are merely expanding services in the already functioning Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory here. Tests for a number of infectious viruses are already being conducted at the lab and Covid-19 tests will soon be included,” said Dr M Ravichandran, dean, Tirunelveli MCH. He added that the lab will be useful in getting quicker results for test samples sent from southern districts of Tamil Nadu.

However, the dean said that a trial run needs to be done before a formal approval is given. “First a trial run will be held and the accuracy of the results will be checked. Only then will the National Institute of Virology give its nod for performing tests for Covid-19,” he explained.

Lab technicians who are already working at the lab will be provided kits for Covid-19 testing and trained. Hence, no additional personnel will be appointed. The lab is set to become fully functional in the next few days.
