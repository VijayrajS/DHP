RAJKOT: If anybody placed under home quarantine steps out of their houses in Piyava village of Savarkundala taluka in Amreli district, they are greeted drum beats, which also send out warnings of stern legal action against them. 

“Beating drums to warn people about royal orders has an ancient culture of this village. So in our fight against Covid-19, we have resorted to this age old practice,” says Bharat Geeda, member of Amreli district panchayat. 

“About one lakh people from Surat have entered into Amreli district since the lockdown period was imposed. Of them 1,000 people have come to Piyava village from Surat and Ahmedabad. All of them have been put under 14-day home quarantine,” says Geeda. “They are warned twice in a day against stepping out of their houses with drum beaters in their courtyards,” he added.
