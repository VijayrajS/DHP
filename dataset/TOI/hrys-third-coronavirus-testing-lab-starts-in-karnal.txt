Karnal: Haryana’s third coronavirus testing laboratory became operational on Saturday at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College, Karnal. On day one, a total of 41 samples were tested for Covid-19 in the laboratory, out of which one was found positive and 40 negative.

Deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav said the laboratory has been set up on the third floor of the KCGMC. A trial run of the lab was successfully conducted on Thursday. Samples from Kaithal and Kurukshetra districts would also be investigated here, he said.

DC Yadav said necessary staff has already been hired by the KCGMC authorities and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) machine for the lab has been taken from the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), as the delivery of RTPCR machine got delayed. The lab can test 144 samples per day.

He said PGIMS, Rohtak and Bhagat Phool Singh Medical College, Khanpur Kalan, in Sonepat already have testing facility. The samples of Covid-19 suspects were being sent to the medical college in Sonipat, but after setting up of this lab, more tests can be conducted and reports would also be out within hours.
