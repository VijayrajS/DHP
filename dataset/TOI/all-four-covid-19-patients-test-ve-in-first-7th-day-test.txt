NAGPUR: After the first Covid-19 patient, who was admitted in the isolation ward of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), tested negative on completion of 7 days in isolation on March 18, samples of other three patients admitted in the isolation ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) here were also sent for tests on Thursday. All of them tested negative.


Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said, “They have to complete 14 days in isolation ward irrespective of results of these random tests. Doctors will also conduct chest x-ray of these patients. After ensuring that there is no infection in their lungs, the patients will be declared free from Covid-19 and allowed to go home,” he said.

As per the protocol, even if seven-day reports are negative, the patients must complete their 14-day isolation period. Another test will be conducted on the 14th day. If this test also results negative, their medicines will be stopped for 24 hours and another test will be conducted after that. Once this test comes negative, a chest x-ray will be done to check any lung infections. Provided everything is fine, they will be discharged on the 15th day. If any of these tests come negative or inconclusive, the patient must stay for another 14 days in isolation.

Apart from three patients from Nagpur, seventh-day samples of two of the three positive patients admitted in GMCH Yavatmal were sent to IGGMCH, which is the only testing centre in Central India, on Thursday. Their results are awaited.

“In the fight between good and bad, good has won! You may lose a few battles. At the end, patience and perseverance helps you win the ultimate war. I’m planning to write a small book on how to handle coronavirus (sic),” the first patient, who is an IT employee and is the only patient at the IGGMCH, texted TOI on Thursday.

His wife, who is admitted to GMCH along with the other three positive patients, said, “I feel good that we are all recovering. I now know God is great. My message to all of you is that believe in prayers. Prayers do miracles (sic),” she said.

The IT employee’s colleague, who too had returned from the US to Nagpur via Doha, said the doctors are now communicating individually about test results to patients.

“What I know is that my first test was positive on March 12 and negative on March 19. While they have taken the samples one more time, I am not sure when the results will be out. Unlike Day 1, they are exercising a lot of caution and communicating with us,” he said.

As no new suspect was reported Covid-19 positive in the last five days, the number of persons from their high-risk contacts reporting to the government hospitals too has also gone down, especially in the last three days.

On Friday, 30 samples of suspects reached from the region at the IGGMCH lab, informed district collector. Swab samples of 28 of them were being tested and results were expected by Friday late night.

One of them was a 29-year-old man having travel history of Goa where he was with foreign tourists, who were tested positive a few days ago. A resident of Ajni, the youth was suffering from fever and sore throat from the last six days. He was admitted to GMCH isolation ward and his samples were collected. Six others reported themselves to the IGGMCH. They had travel history of Dubai, Germany, USA, and France.
