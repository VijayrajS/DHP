2020-03-13
PATNA: In view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in the country, the Bihar Industries Association (BIA) has postponed the ‘Bihar Startup Conclave’, which was scheduled to be held on March 14 in the city. The next date will be finalized once the effect of the virus minimizes.


BIA officials claimed that it was necessary to cancel the event as Covid-19 had spread its tentacles all over. Association’s president Ram Lal Khetan told this newspaper on Thursday, “The main speakers of the event, which include leading investors, innovators and entrepreneurs, have expressed their inability to attend the event on March 14. Hence, we will probably organize the conclave next month.”

The event will provide a platform to budding entrepreneurs, students and innovators with new startup ideas. The BIA has received more than 100 plans for the conclave, which is based on the ‘Agri-tech’ theme. Most entries are from Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Kerala and Chennai.

“During the last three years, the BIA has provided funds to more than 50 startup plans. This year, we are promoting the technologies in the agriculture sector, on which a major population of the country is dependent. At least 14 prominent speakers will throw light on different aspects of the topic,” Khetan said and added that panel discussions and chats would also be conducted as part of the daylong conclave.

The first three winners will get Rs 1 lakh, Rs 50,000 and Rs 25,000, respectively. The next three will receive consolation prizes of Rs 10,000 each.
