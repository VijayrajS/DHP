‘Remove restrictions on testing’
2020-05-28
AHMEDABAD: After the Gujarat high court’s observation against the state government’s restrictive Covid-19 testing policy, the Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) has moved the HC for permission to private laboratories and hospitals to carry out the RT-PCR test freely without any government restrictions.

AMA, which comprises nearly 9,000 doctors, has urged the HC to quash the government policy mandating private laboratories to seek prior approval form the Sola Civil Hospital before conducting a Covid-19 test. It has urged the HC to permit all private laboratories and hospitals having requisite infrastructure to conduct RT-PCR tests without any government interference.

The petitioner claims that there are about 12 private laboratories and 19 government laboratories, which have been granted permission by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct RT-PCR tests for Covid-19. It further says that in many instances, patients require surgery and before that ascertaining their Covid-19 status is extremely essential for various reasons.
