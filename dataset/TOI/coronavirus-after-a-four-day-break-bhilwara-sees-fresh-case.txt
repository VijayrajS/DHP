JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s relief at Covid-19 ground zero Bhilwara not reporting any new infections in four days proved short-lived on Saturday with a test report confirming the textile city’s 27th novel coronavirus case.


The person who tested positive is among those who had visited the OPD of the private hospital that has emerged as the epicentre of the outbreak in Bhilwara. Of the 27 Covid-19 cases in the town so far, 18 are members of the medical staff in that hospital.

Additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh said, the fresh case wasn’t quite a setback. He also said, the two of the earlier Covid-19 patients had fully recovered and returned home during the day.

A huge team of health workers stationed in Bhilwara till April 13 is waiting to see how the 6,500-odd residents under self-quarantine do in the second phase of confinement.
