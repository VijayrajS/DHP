‘After lockdown, waste collection must be on track’
2020-05-04
Panaji: Panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho said he was aware that some panchayats have sidestepped from their obligations of waste management in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. He will meet the panchayats director to ensure that all panchayats earnestly continue their civic duty of collection and disposal of waste.

Godindo said work of setting up waste treatment plants for panchayats is under way. The waste treatment plants coming up at Chicalim and Zuarinagar, he said, are at an advanced stage. Both plants will have an inbuilt capacity to generate fuel from waste.

A few months before the Covid-19 scare, waste collection and disposal had fallen in line. Strong measures by the government had compelled them to act following petitions in the high court and at other forums such as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to take waste management seriously.

Now it has been noticed that of 190 panchayats, some have gone back to their old ways of functioning and stopped regular collection of waste. Non-collection of waste leads to dumping in open spaces and mostly along roadsides.

It’s been more than a decade that the government has been pursuing village panchayat bodies to not neglect their civic duties. Coastal panchayats whether is it is North Goa or South Goa have a system in place for waste collection. They pick waste generated in their respective jurisdiction but many are yet to penalise people caught dumping waste in open spaces.

“Officials had started penalising people held guilty of dumping waste but they seems to have lost zeal amid Covid-19 pandemic. As regular activities picks up we will see public places and road sides getting littered if civic bodies do not take their civic responsibility seriously,” said a municipal official.
