With more activities allowed, cops go easy on lockdown violators
2020-05-14
Nagpur: With more and more activities being allowed, the police are taking less actions against those found on the streets. The strict action cases have gone down steeply compared to earlier phases of lockdown.

While fewer offences have been registered, city police have tried to make up with high number of challan cases. On May 9, traffic police had fined 1,142 persons, 705 on May 10, 1,120 on May 11 and 910 on May 12. The issuing of challans is far less a deterrent than seizing of vehicles for plying without permission. 

City police chief BK Upadhyay said there was a shift in focus towards city’s 15 or so containment zones. “We are enforcing the lockdown srictly in those zones. Police are focusing more on stopping the spread of the virus from positive persons to others,” he said. 

On May 12, cops had registered 35 cases under Section 188 of the IPC for breach of lockdown norms. On April 12, they had registered 52 similar cases. Also, cops had detained 82 people on April 12 but it was only nine on May 12.

On April 12, city police registered 17 offences under Section 269 and 270 of IPC against persons for acting in a negligent manner. On May 12, only two such cases were registered.

Upadhyay added the numbers of exempted services had been increased with even hosieries, stationery and spare parts shops being allowed on alternate days. “The increased movement of the public on the road is proportionate to the services being allowed which police cannot lawfully curtail,” he said. 

This month, the cases slapped against the violators reflected rather loose enforcement with cops appearing to have lost the initial steam under increasing work pressure and temperature. They detained only 42 persons between May 9 and May 12 for loitering without purpose. More than 250 were rounded up between April 9 and April 12.

DCP, headquarters and traffic, Vikram Sali also said the bulk of the deployment was at the containment zones and adjoining localities and at quarantine centres apart, from helping the migrant labourers. “The high court has also appreciated me and Addl CP, crime, Nilesh Bharne, for our role in helping at least 10,000 migrants return home,” said Sali.
