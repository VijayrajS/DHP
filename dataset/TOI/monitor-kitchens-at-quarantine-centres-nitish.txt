PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Friday asked chief secretary Deepak Kumar to increase the number of kitchens proportionate to people staying at each quarantine centre so that they could get quality meals on time.


The CM at a review meeting also asked the disaster management department (DMD) to regularly monitor the kitchens and foods prepared at the quarantine centres. Reiterating the need of sufficient toilets and washrooms at each quarantine centre, Nitish said a senior official should regularly visit such centres.

He said the district administration should ensure all necessary arrangements at the quarantine centres as per the DMD’s standard operating procedure (SOP). Nitish asked the health department officials to expedite the work of random testing along with the ongoing contact tracing of Covid-19 patients. “Testing of people in the red zones should be done on a priority basis,” he said and asked the officials to ensure availability of sufficient testing kits in all districts.

Nitish further asked the officials to make necessary arrangements for testing and quarantine of people who would return from other countries. “Maintain proper coordination with the ministry of foreign affairs and make arrangements as per the protocol,” Nitish said.
