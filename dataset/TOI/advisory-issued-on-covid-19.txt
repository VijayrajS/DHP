Puducherry: The directorate of health and family welfare services has issued an advisory urging the people to avoid public gatherings including festivals and social events in the wake of the coronavirus infection scare. 

Director (health and family welfare) S Mohankumar said people who have travelled abroad and have come in contact with those suffering from coronavirus disease to avoid public appearances and to stay indoors isolated for 14 days. People with fever, cough and breathing trouble must avoid public events. If they could not avoid participation in the events, they should wear mask or cover face with a tissue paper or napkin as a precautionary measure, he said. "Hence kind cooperation of the people of Puducherry is very much requested regarding frequent handwash and to avoid public gathering so that we can be safe and peaceful," Mohankumar said.
