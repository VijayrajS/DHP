Coronavirus: Video calls to monitor quarantined residents in Pune
2020-03-30
PUNE: The Pune police will use the video-calling facility on smartphones to keep tabs on the 1,200-plus home-quarantined people in the city.

 
 
This initiative is aimed at helping police eliminating contact with the potentially infected and also save time. As many as 152 teams have been formed to monitor 1,276 people under home quarantine. 

“We are stressing on minimal public contact for police personnel,” joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve told TOI.

“Policemen at different checkpoints have also started using selfie sticks to scan QR code-enabled permits issued to motorists for emergency commutes,” Shisve added.

From Monday, police will also deploy drone-mounted cameras to monitor the situation on the roads and vehicular movement, he said.

Each police station has formed teams to check on home quarantined people on a daily basis, following instances across the state of people breaking home quarantine. 

A senior police officer said those under home quaratantine must designate a specific spot in their house to receive the video calls from the police, who will use screenshots of the calls to keep records. 

The calls will be made at random in a bid to ensure the home quarantined toe the line. 

“It is the duty of the constables from the monitoring team to check if the quarantined person is standing right at the designated spot during the call. In case any discrepancy, the team will visit the house to check on the quarantined individual,” he said.

Also, police have collected phone numbers of the neighbours of the home quarantined persons and told them too to keep an eye on their movement. “The neighbours can contact police if they see the home quarantine moving outside their residence,” police said. 

On Sunday, masks, sanitizers and selfie sticks were distributed to police personnel manning checkpoints across the city.
