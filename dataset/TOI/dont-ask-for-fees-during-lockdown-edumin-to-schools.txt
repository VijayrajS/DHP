2020-04-18
Nagpur: State’s education minister Varsha Gaikwad has asked schools not to ask for either pending or upcoming fees until the lockdown is in effect. TOI was the first to report about dilemma of school managements on whether or not to ask for fee during the lockdown period. Some schools, which have online payment facility, had sent messages to their parents to clear dues.Gaikwad said, “Our department has issued a circular in which schools have been asked not to demand fee during the lockdown period. Not only the movement of parents is restricted (due to lockdown) but also there could be financial stress on them in the current situation.”She further urged parents to inform her department about non-compliance. “If your school continues to demand fee during this period, a complaint can be filed with the local education department. All officials have been briefed about the same,” said Gaikwad. School owners say they welcome the minister’s decision but on ‘humanitarian’ grounds, affluent parents should pay the dues. Rajendra Dayma, president of state-level Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said “Those parents who can pay online must do it on their own as this will be used to pay teachers’ salaries. We are struggling financially as the final installment of fee has not been recieved yet.”He added that schools paid salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff for entire year. “It’s not like we stop salaries during summer and Diwali vacations. To ensure that every month salaries are disbursed, fees need to be paid by parents,” said Dayma.Salaries make up for the biggest chunk of expenses, according to IESA. “On average, 50% of the expenses of every school is on salary. It could be more for some institutions,” said Dayma.
