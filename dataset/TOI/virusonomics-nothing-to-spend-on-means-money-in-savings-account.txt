Virusonomics: Nothing to spend on means money in savings account
2020-05-04
New Delhi: Till the first week of March, one might have suspected Siddhartha Banerjee of displaying mild strains of oniomania — the compulsive desire to buy things that one might not necessarily ‘need’. These ranged from pens to running shoes that the 33-year-old HR professional might perhaps use once during the year. His purchases, and those of his wife, have come to a screeching halt. Banerjee still shops, but he restricts his shopping to groceries and vegetables.

"The lockdown made us realise that a big portion of our monthly expenditure was due to shopping and eating out. These have stopped completely," said Chittaranjan Park resident Banerjee. "It’s going to be the seventh weekend that we haven’t stepped out of the house, met our friends or celebrated their birthdays and anniversaries."

The couple hasn’t felt the need to buy new clothes. Banerjee is comfortable working from home in T-shirt and shorts and his wife, Niharika, hasn’t spent on cosmetics, shoes or ornaments. "I’m saving more than Rs 30,000 a month. A third of this is because I am not driving," he said.

The couple, however, feels some ‘non-essentials’ are actually essential to give life a semblance of normality. Banerjee misses his single malts the most, and the first ‘essential’ thing he wants to buy to mark the return to normalcy will be a bottle of his loved Scotch whisky. His mother wants a bigger TV set and Niharika her favourite lipstick.

Like Banerjee, Poonam Mishra, 35, too craves to constantly buy clothes and shoes. "I work in the happening CyberHub in Gurgaon, and miss going out with friends," revealed the environmental consultant. The lockdown, therefore, has meant big savings for her, though she grins that a little indulgence and a slice of the pre-Covid life couldn’t hurt.

Her husband, Ajinkya Gunjan Mishra, a corporate and tax lawyer, however, has a different take. "If not for the pandemic, we would be readying for our annual vacation with the courts on vacation in May and June," said the 35-year-old. He indulges on vacations, often in foreign locales, but concedes, "This year, even Shimla and Mussoorie are a distant dream." Mishra said he was planning to buy a new car, but will have to postpone the decision because there is a lot of uncertainty about financial security now.

Covid-19 has also upended the travel plans of PR professional Urvashi Sharma, 28. "Travel, food and films are my passions and spending on these have halted," Sharma admitted. "I travel abroad annually and was planning to visit Greece this year but have cancelled my plans. I also eat out with friends every weekend or even alone and go to the theatre for films. The lockdown has changed everything."

But there’s a positive side to this. Sharma smiles, "With nothing to splurge on, I have realised I’m saving over 90% of my salary! I now cook at home and find the experience therapeutic. I’m going to continue with this lifestyle after the lockdown, and even if my salary is affected by the economic turbulence, I will still be able to put something aside."

Like Sharma, many Delhi millennials are getting used to the idea of saving, which otherwise was an intrinsic part of life only for those who grew up in pre-liberalisation India. "I have saved Rs 15,000 this month on food and transportation alone," exulted marketing professional Jaswinder Singh, 25. "Savings have become important due to lack of job security now."

Like Sharma and Singh, dining was a biggest indulgence for Karan Singh, 25, a media manager for a CSR project. "When I’m with my parents in Rajouri Garden, I eat out frequently in fine dining restaurants. When posted in other cities, I order food in. I’m a food blogger and love posting culinary photographs," he said. Singh, in fact, orders food so frequently that he has even been mistaken for being a commercial outlet. With isolation has come wisdom. "Earlier I knew the prices of dishes I was ordering, but now I even know how much tomato and potato cost and how much garlic you need in a curry," Singh laughed.

Those a bit senior feel reining in spending has helped detoxify their lives. "Not eating out has resulted in my blood sugar levels coming down to healthy levels, so I’m definitely not complaining," said chartered accountant Pankaj Agarwal, 58. "I was also tiring of the hectic socialising, dinners and gift buying." Though Agarwal and his wife Anjali, 57, who works for the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), are both film buffs, they aren’t planning to splurge on cineplexes anytime soon.

"Though EMIs and certain expenses are constant, my spending on food, clothes, shoes and gadgets has reduced. As an educator for children with special needs, the substantial amount I spent on workshops has dipped," said Sonam Agarwal Sachdeva, 43. "However, I also feel that we are stocking more things and increased purchases of hand sanitisers, gloves and expensive face masks." She felt the pandemic will lead to attitudinal changes and people will become more minimalistic.

And yet, Banerjee pointed out, saving money would, in the long run, have an adverse effect. "If we stop buying, manufacturing will be affected and there will be job cuts, which will start a vicious cycle," he cautioned. "If industry comes to a standstill, our investments would also be static. We have to break the Covid-19 chain, not the demand and supply chain. We have to build a robust parallel system so that markets can open, but we remain safe from corona infection."
