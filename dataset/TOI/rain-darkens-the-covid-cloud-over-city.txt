Rain darkens THE Covid cloud over city
2020-06-06
Ahmedabad: The city is battling a high number of Covid-19 cases, so the untimely rain on Friday — lashing several areas of Ahmedabad — could not have come at a worse time. The rain has stoked concerns of a sudden rise in viral infections, owing to an abrupt temperature fluctuation. Adjusting to the fluctuation can be difficult and it could help viruses multiply, especially when temperatures begin to rise again in the coming days, according to a senior doctor at VS Hospital.

In Ahmedabad, areas such as Sarkhej, Bodakdev, Paldi, Vatva, and Danapith received an average rainfall of 11.89mm. The city received 14.73mm. These areas have been recording between 20% and 35% rise in Covid-19 infections since last week.The city’s outskirts such as Bopal, Shilaj, and Shela received showers, leading to waterlogging for a short duration. 

Dr Manoj Vithlani, a general physician treating Covid-19, said,“Considering that heat did not suppress the spread of the virus, we can assume that cases will rise in rains when humidity is high and atmosphere is conducive to viral growth,” he said.
