Kolhapur: A newly-wed couple from Kolhapur set an example for couples planning to tie knots amid Covid-19 crisis by donating their saved wedding expenses to the state government’s relief fund. The couple handed over Rs 51,000 cheque to district guardian minister Satej Patil.

Aditya and Rasika, who tied the knot on Thursday, held a private function with no guests invited. Only their close family members were present for the rituals. Aditya, the only son of Krushnaji, works as an auditor. 

A grand wedding was planned earlier, however, the Covid-19 crisis and lockdown rules forced us to rework on out wedding plan and hold the rituals in private with only a few people present, said the couple. 

The lockdown rules does not permit attendance of more than 50 people for a wedding ceremony. The families of the bride and the groom, therefore, thought that only close family members should be present. 

“It is our duty to serve the society. I did not imagine that such a moment would come in my life. We have done our part and hope others follow suit. We had earlier booked a huge hall and had even chalked out the guest list. We had even fixed the menu for dinner. However, the time is such that we have to hold ourselves back. Such times brings out the good in you,” said Aditya.

Aditya and Rasika both said that they missed their close friends at the wedding. “ I missed my friends at the wedding. I had to convince them a lot for this. Finally, they too agreed and supported our decision,” said Aditya.

Prathamesh Rajopadhye, one of Aaditya’s close friends, said, “I am proud of him. We all should be responsible like him. I missed his wedding, but I am sure he will compensate it by throwing a grand party after the lockdown ends.”
