PUNE: Three civic body officials would be home quarantined, as they had gone on a tour to Australia, a senior PMC official said on Tuesday. 


The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had suggested travel restrictions for its civic officials in the wake of the coronavirus spread. The trio had not sought permission for the Australia, a senior PMC official said.

“Show cause notices will be issued to these officials. We will hear their views. Action may be taken against them for flouting the travel advisory,” PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal told TOI. 

Ramchandra Hankare, head of the PMC’s health department, said the three officials would have to undergo tests on arrival. “If any Covid-19 symptom is found, they will be sent to Naidu Hospital. Otherwise, they will have to be home quarantined. The 14-day isolation will be mandatory for them,” 

PMC sources said the officials who have gone to Australia belonged to the water department and wanted to see the pipeline and drainage system there.
