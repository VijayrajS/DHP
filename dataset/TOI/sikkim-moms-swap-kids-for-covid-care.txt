Sikkim moms swap kids for Covid care
2020-06-14
Siliguri: Two women have had to temporarily swap their children after a toddler and a mother tested positive for Covid-19 in Sikkim.

Doctors at STNM Hospital have put the positive 2-year-old — the youngest Covid patient in the Himalayan state till date — in the care of a positive woman, whose negative 3-year-old is in the custody of the unaffected mother at a quarantine facility. 

The woman and the toddler were among 14 fresh cases reported in Sikkim on Thursday. The duos had been housed at a quarantine facility at Paljor Namgyal Girls’ Senior Secondary School in Gangtok following their travel history to Mumbai. Gangtok has been declared a containment zone.

“We have a case where a mother has tested positive, but her child is unaffected. Another 2-year-old has tested positive, but her mother is negative. So, we have kept the affected pair together to prevent transmission,” said paediatrician Ruth Yanzon. 

The doctor, however, maintained that the swapping may have to be reversed if the children start looking for their mothers. 

“The Covid-positive toddler is doing fine and has had a good night’s sleep on Friday. In fact, both are asymptomatic and their condition is stable,” Yanzon added.

Two floors at STNM hospital with 266 beds are dedicated to Covid-19 patients. The ward has eight doctors and 32 health workers. 

Director-general and secretary (health and family welfare), Sikkim, Pempa Tshering Bhutia said 36 cases were reported on Friday. Twenty-three have been reported from south district and 13 from west district.

“All 36 are currently at quarantine centres and asymptomatic. The 23 patients from south district, including 18 with travel history to Maharashtra, are being shifted to the isolation ward at STNM hospital,” Bhutia added.

According to a health bulletin, the total number of cases reported in the state is 63; of which 58 are still active.
