NEW DELHI: Jamia Millia Islamia announced on Sunday that as a precautionary measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus, it is shutting down its hostels, libraries and canteens. It has asked students to go home and not assemble at the university. However, students of Jamia’s Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) sitting on protest for around three months outside gate number 7 have yet to take a call on if they would disband their congregation as part of social distancing.

Two days after announcing that they are suspending classes till March 31, the Jamia administration came out with a notice on Sunday to announce the shutting down of student accommodations too.

In their advisory, Jamia said that Covid-19 epidemic will enter into the phase of exponential growth, which is “highly dangerous in terms of magnitude and dimension as an infectious disease.” Stating that many educational institutes are now shut, the advisory said that it is beyond them to contain the danger.

“Places of gatherings like hostels, dining halls, libraries, kitchens are highly vulnerable and susceptible to the threat. The best course of action is to secure the students, teachers, workers and non-teaching staff,” the advisory said.

This has been seen by many at Jamia as an advisory for students sitting on protest. Responding to the advisory, JCC member Safoora Zargar said that “JCC will discuss on their course of action and decide on if they would continue the protest.”
