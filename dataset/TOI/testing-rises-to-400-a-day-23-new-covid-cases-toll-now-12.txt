West Bengal: Testing rises to 400 a day; 23 new Covid cases, toll now 12
2020-04-19
KOLKATA: The state government has ramped up “trace and test” in the containment zones spread over Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur, taking the average Covid testing figures a day to 400 when the initial test figures were 50 to 60. The situation in Howrah remains critical where 10% of the 580 samples tested have come out to be positive.

Bengal on Saturday recorded 23 more cases over the past 24 hours, taking the number of total active cases to 178. Two more deaths were recorded, taking the total toll to 12. 

“A total 4,630 samples have been tested so far that boils down to 400 tests per day. We will be adding to the testing capacity by 50 when the testing laboratory in Malda becomes operational. Most of these samples are being tested at NICED and SSKM. Each of them has a capacity of testing 100 samples,” chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said at Nabanna on Saturday. The chief secretary was “shocked” to hear claims by a section of people that a laboratory can test 1,000 samples a day. 

The state government has also applied to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) seeking permission for setting up more laboratories in a bid to put to rest the public complaint that Covid tests are not being done in the state at the optimal level. “We have already applied to the ICMR for three more laboratories at Burdwan, Durgapur and Murshidabad because it takes time to bring samples to Kolkata,” Sinha said. The chief secretary has urged the eight functioning laboratories in the state to run in double shifts that may help to scale up the testing of swab samples further.

According to the chief secretary, the state has no problem conducting rapid tests in the containment zones. “We are open to suggestions and have no problem conducting rapid tests. But the rapid test kits from the Centre are yet to reach the state,” Sinha said. 

The chief secretary took stock of the containment plan with the district health officials, medical superintendent cum vice-principals of hospitals, and Swasthya Bhavan officials in a video conference on Saturday. The plan according to the chief secretary has three layers — enforcing the complete lockdown, ramping up trace and test of residents and a coordinated action by multiple agencies to send the Covid positive cases to Covid hospitals, and isolating the other members of the family.

Sinha claimed that the state has no dearth of Covid hospitals and beds to treat patients. 

As of now, the situation hasn’t got worse in districts from where Covid cases were reported. “No fresh Covid case has been reported from Kalimpong since April 2, and from Jalpaiguri since April 4. East Midnapore hasn’t reported a case since April 11, while there has been no fresh case from north 24 Parganas since April 17,” Sinha said.
