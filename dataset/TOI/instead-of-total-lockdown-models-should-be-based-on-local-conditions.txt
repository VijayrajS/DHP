The Covid-19 crisis is unique in many ways. Many countries lacked previous experience to tackle such a pandemic and India is no exception. Post-independence, the outbreak of Covid-19 and the lockdown are a one-of-its-kind experience for India. 

Every country, state, region and city is different. Specific lockdown rules for one place may not be applicable for another place. India’s requirements will be different from a country like China or any other developed nation in terms of population density, economic classes, ethnic diversity, climate, lifestyle and immunity levels. One also has to keep in mind the heavy urbanization and mass migration. The containment measures for different places depend on all these factors. 

Pune city has a huge population of students from across the country and abroad and also migrant workers from Maharashtra and outside the state. Following the abrupt closure of all activities in the city, they were affected most. Several migrant workers were intercepted at various nakabandi points while they were trying to leave. Many old people suffered in the absence of their caretakers. Several households were also affected in the with the plumbers, electrician and barbers staying away from work. 

In the initial stage of Covid-19 crisis, when people with travel history were mostly affected, we could have allowed students, migrant labourers and stranded people to leave the city through some special travel arrangements after basic health screening. In the city, they are now more susceptible to contract the disease. 

Instead of a total lockdown , different lockdown models based on local conditions would have a better impact. The impact of the lockdown on economy and livelihood is worrisome.
