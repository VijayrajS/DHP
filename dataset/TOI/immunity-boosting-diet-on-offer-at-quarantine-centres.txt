2020-04-10
Vijayawada: At the 16 quarantine centres across the district, officials are ensuring that a special diet is provided to 450 persons suspected to have Covid-19. Authorities of the health wing are focusing on boosting the immunity of the suspected patients through a protein-rich diet prescribed by physicians.

Eggs, milk, banana and tender coconut water have been included in the diet, as have dry fruits and nuts such as cashew nuts, almonds and raisins.

Wilson Babu, district nodal officer for quarantine centers, said they have focused on improving the immunity of persons in quarantine. “Close contacts of coronavirus-infected patients have the maximum chance of infection. Boosting immunity will help them fight the virus naturally. We are providing all amenities for the persons under quarantine. Special kits which include new clothes, toothbrush, shaving kits, soap, towel and 15 other essential goods were given to them,” he said.

A number of voluntary organisations have also come forward to provide nutritious food. The Swarna Bharat Trust donated 25 kilograms of cashew nuts, while Kutumba Rao, a member of the district poultry traders’ association donated around 10,000 eggs, Wilson Babu said.
