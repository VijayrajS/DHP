‘No plan for one more lockdown’
2020-06-11
Gandhinagar: Deputy chief minister and state government spokesman Nitin Patel appealed to people not to believe rumours that the state government is contemplating a complete lockdown again.

For the second time, the government has had to issue a clarification that there is no proposal for a complete lockdown even as messages to this effect are being circulated on social media.

“There is no plan at any level of enforcing a total lockdown again. Although the Covid-19 numbers have increased, the situation is under control and there is no need to consider any such proposal. The government has a clear view of controlling the spread of Covid-19 without economic restrictions,” Patel said.
