2020-06-06
PUNE: BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil on Monday raised doubts over the money spent by the Maharashtra government in preventing the spread of coronavirus. 


"Very limited resources have been utilised by the state. The Centre’s contribution is noteworthy. The state government should present details about the utilisation of the funds for curbing the spread of the disease," said Patil while addressing a news conference here on Friday.

"Apart from sharing 15% of the fare of the migrants, nothing much seems to have been done by the state,” Patil said.He also alleged that the infrastructure set up for mitigation activities was of inferior quality and lacked proper planning. 

"Temporary hospitals built specially for handling Covid-19 patients had to be closed down in Mumbai. It shows lack of planning at the state government level," he said. 

Patil also expressed reservations about chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s functioning. "The CM has not actively conducted meetings with ministers. He was not seen working much on the ground," he said.
