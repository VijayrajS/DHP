Madurai: The Virudhunagar district administration on Monday sealed two cracker units in Sivakasi, which were functioning illegally by violating the curfew.

Recently, Virudhunagar district collector R Kannan had said that permission would be granted for cracker units situated in the rural areas to function from April 20. He said that the units can commence functioning with 50% employees and adhering to all safety norms by following social distancing, spraying disinfectant and issuing masks to the employees. Subsequently, the district administration officials had sent a communication asking the fireworks manufacturers not to commence production and to wait for detailed guidelines, to be issued by the government following the recommendations of an expert committee. Meanwhile, a cracker unit situated at Anuppankulam village with 11 workers, including its owner Kanimuthu and another unit owned by Murugan, situated at Vetrilaioorani village with four employees, started functioning.

Speaking to TOI, Sivakasi sub-collector C Dinesh Kumar said that when the officials were carrying out a routine inspection, they noticed that both these units which were licenced by the district revenue officer were manufacturing crackers illegally.

“The employees were secretly manufacturing crackers without wearing masks and without social distancing by violating the curfew rules. The employees at the cracker unit at Vetrilaioorani were seen manufacturing cracker under a thatched shed which was a violation,” he said. 

Since both units were functioning illegally by violating the rules even after a communication was sent by the officials, they were sealed.. TNN
