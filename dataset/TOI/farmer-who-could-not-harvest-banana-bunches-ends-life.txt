Covid-19 lockdown: Farmer who could not harvest banana bunches ends life
2020-03-30
TRICHY: A 65-year-old banana farmer from Kuzhumani village, who consumed pesticide four days ago distressed by crop loss, died at the Mahatma Gandhi Medical College Hospital on Saturday night.


Family members of K Periyasamy of Mela Kuzhumani said he resorted to the extreme step as he could not harvest Nendran banana cultivated on half an acre of leased land following the nationwide lockdown. He had raised Ela Arisi banana on his one acre and Nendran on the half acre.

Periyasamy was upset that he could not harvest and sell his crop and it had started to ripen on the tree itself. He was found consuming pesticide at his house on March 25 and was rushed to MGMGH where he died on Saturday. Deputy superintendent of police Jeeyapuram C Kokila told TOI that the loss sustained in banana cultivation had caused some domestic issues. Jeeyapuram police registered a case under 174 IPC based on a complaint from his family members. He is survived by his wife P Krishnammal, a daughter and son. 

TOI had reported how the fall in demand for Nendran in Kerala had hit Trichy farmers hard leading to a crash in the price of the variety to about Rs 10 to 15 a kg. The outbreak of Covid-19 dealt a huge blow to the distressed farmers as it halted the transport of the entire consignment of Nendran to Kerala. The 21-day lockdown only made matters worse. Farmers’ leaders have appealed to the state government to compensate the victim’s family appropriately
