MP: Couple in 60s beat Covid together, ‘marry’ again
2020-06-05
BHOPAL: An elderly couple in MP’s Damoh were so overwhelmed after recovering from Coronavirus infection that they garlanded each other, like they did during their wedding nearly four decades ago.

“It is our second life,” said the 62-year-old ‘bride’.

The couple had returned from Gurugram to Damoh’s Rasilpur village last month in a group of 20 or so. She was the first to test positive for Coronavirus on May 19. Everyone in the family was then swabbed for Covid-19 test, and 13 tested positive, including her husband, aged 64, said Dr Diwaker Patel, a resident medical officer of Damoh hospital. The woman took longer to respond to treatment. Ten members of the family were discharged a few days ago. On June 2, it was the turn of the couple.

Following tradition of giving recovered patients a cheery sendoff, hospital staff felicitated the elderly couple with flowers. Someone handed them garlands.
