Rajkot: Nothing can stop you if you have made up your mind to contribute your bit to the society. That he is jobless and is practically existing hand to mouth in this critical time didn’t stop roadside painter of Rajkot, Rambhai Makwana, from doing some good, his style. Unemployed for the past one month, Makwana wanted to fight corona his own way by painting city’s roads with Gujarati slogan against the virus, ‘Jivan Bachavo, Gharma Raho’ (Save life, Stay at home), with colours that were lying unused at his home.Makwana, a resident of Bhagavti para has three daughters, and has been seating near Jubli garden, one of the busiest roads of the city, for more than a decade now painting banners and boards and earning Rs 500 to 700 per day. Ever since Janta Curfew on March 22, Makwana has been unemployed. But his creative mind did not allow him to seat idle at home. Therefore, he started painting city’s roads from Friday starting his task from Greenland Chowkdi, entery point of Rajkot from Ahmedabad road, and painted all the crossroads including Pedak road, Parevdi chowk, Hospital chowk and Jubili chowk. Talking to TOI, Makwana said: “I am a daily wage earner. I stayed at home following government’s direction, but I also wanted to do something for my society. I know nothing except painting and so, I started painting the roads.”However, Makwana will soon run out of paints. “I want to paint all the roads of the city. But, I have limited paints. If I manage to get more colours, I will paint all the roads with the slogan,” said Makwana, who takes only five minutes to paint one road with the slogan. The painter is confident that he will be able to complete his task of painting the whole city in just a couple of days only.
