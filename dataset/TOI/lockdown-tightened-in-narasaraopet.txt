GUNTUR: The Guntur district administration has decided to impose three days of complete lockdown in Narasaraopet town following a steep rise in Covid-19 cases. 

As many as 13 positive cases were reported in the town on Monday, taking the tally to 142. As part of efforts to break the chain of transmission, the special officer for Covid-19 containment operations and Tenali sub-collector Kothamasu Dinesh Kumar has announced a 72-hour lockdown. The district administration had imposed a five-day-long complete lockdown in the town till Sunday.

Officials granted some respite on Monday and Tuesday for locals to procure groceries. As per the original plan, the lockdown was relaxed for three hours between 6 am to 9 pm on both days. The decision to tighten restrictions again was taken after people crowded marketplaces on Monday. “It looks like that people are not learning any lessons despite the fact that coronavirus is spreading fast in the town and may cause harm to everyone,” said Dinesh Kumar.

Expressing displeasure at the rush in markets and absence of social distancing, Dinesh Kumar said efforts of the administration would go to waste if people failed to follow rules.
