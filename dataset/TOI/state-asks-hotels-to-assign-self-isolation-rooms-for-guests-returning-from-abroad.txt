KOLKATA: In an unprecedented development, the state has sought help from hoteliers to arrange rooms for self-isolation of guests. The health and tourism departments have asked Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) to request their members to assign rooms for this purpose and HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar told TOI the association has already written to its members. 

“We need to help the health department fight this threat of Covid-19. We have been asked to request our hotel owner members to allocate rooms in their establishments for self-isolation of the large number of people returning home from various countries. Currently, some of them are housed at government facilities at New town,” he added, pointing out that some of these people would prefer to stay in hotel rooms. 

T S Walia, former national president of Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI) told TOI that it has received positive response from many of its members. “We have arranged 300 rooms for this purpose. Our association is confident that in another two-three days, we can arrange 600-700 rooms in the city for self-isolation,” he said. Walia added that all members who have agreed to assign rooms are ready to offer the facility on a cost-to-cost basis. “The charges will be Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000, depending on categories (3-4 star or 5 star), which would include breakfast, lunch and dinner,” he said. 

Poddar said that at present there are 2,500-2,600 rooms in five-star and five-star deluxe categories in the city while there are 2,000-plus rooms in 3-star and 4-star categories.
