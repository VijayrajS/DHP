Covid-19 survey a ticking time bomb: Congress
2020-04-12
Margao: The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee on Saturday said that the Covid-19 survey to be undertaken by the government from Monday was a part of BJP’s preparation for the 2022 assembly election. A press note by GPCC president Girish Chodankar said that the statement made by chief minister Pramod Sawant accepting that the data collected from the survey will be useful in the future was a clear indication of that. 

“The CM should understand that while preparing for future, he is putting at stake lives of 7,000 (non- medical staff) government employees and 15 lakh Goan population. He has set a time bomb ticking,” Chodankar said in the press note, adding that the chief minister would be solely responsible for this “suicidal decision and all responsibility of any untoward incident and disaster will solely rest on him”.

He demanded that all employees engaged in the survey be provided with PPE and be certified Corona negative before exposing them to the public at large.

As regards the chief minister’s announcement that government offices will remain open from Monday, Chodankar questioned how government employees were expected to reach their offices in the absence of public transport in Goa.
