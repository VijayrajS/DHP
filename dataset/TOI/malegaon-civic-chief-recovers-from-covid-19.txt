Nashik: Malegaon municipal commissioner Dipak Kasar, who had tested positive for coronavirus on May 12, has recovered from the contagion and will resume work in full swing after two weeks of self-quarantine.

Kasar said that he received the results of the second test on Thursday night. Although his wife and five staff members at his residence had not contracted coronavirus, their swabs had been sent for testing as a precautionary measure. All of them have tested negative for the contagion, he added.

The civic chief said that the tests were carried out at the Covid-19 laboratory in the government medical college and hospital (GMCH), Dhule.

Speaking to TOI, Kasar said that he would remain in home quarantine for 14 days. “I would be happier if the people of the textile town win the war against Covid-19. My appeal to people is that they should not shy away from getting tested if they have corona-like symptoms. It would help them in getting early treatment,” he said

The civic chief said that he followed a simple diet after testing positive for Covid-19 and also took his medicines regularly while observing all the necessary quarantine rules. 

Kasar, who was asymptomatic, said that he worked from home while guiding the civic officials on different issues, particularly on the Covid-19 front.

“I have been working for six-seven hours from home daily after testing positive for the contagion. I held video-conferencing with heads of different departments and discussed different issues, proposed covid care centres, financial aspects, etc. I did not have any physical or mental constraints while working from home,” he added.
