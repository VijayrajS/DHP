‘Acceptance is the key, to get through lockdown period’
2020-04-04
Nashik: Most of the state government counsellors have been instructing people with disabilities to accept staying indoors for 21 days, as it will help them get through the lockdown period. 

The Disability Commissionerate, Government of Maharashtra, Pune which is a Maharashtra State Mental Health Awareness Committee has appointed 10 volunteers to answer people’s queries.

Approximately four to five people are calling counsellors every day out of which few are kept under quarantine by the hospital authorities. “People call to clarify many of their misconceptions. I had got a call where the caller wanted to know that if he is not going outside his house, how many times he should wash his hands? This is a common question and should be dealt with carefully,” said Nitin Vispute, a counsellor from Jalgaon.

“It will become a psychological disorder if people wash their hands every half-hour even if they are not going outside the house,” Vispute told TOI.

According to Vispute, it is the counsellors’ responsibility to convince those who are panicking due to staying indoors that they do not come out of their houses and start crowding in public places. “We have to make them feel positive about the lockdown and tell them it is for their own good,” he added.
