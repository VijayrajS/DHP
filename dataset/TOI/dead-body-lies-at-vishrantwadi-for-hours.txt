PUNE: The body of an unidentified man lies on a footpath of Alandi Road in Vishrantwadi on late Sunday afternoon for three to four hours as people and police were fearful of Covid-19 having caused his death.


Senior inspector Arun Avhad of the Vishrantwadi police told TOI, “The reason for the man’s death is yet to be ascertained. Residents in the vicinity found the body on the footpath.” 

“Police rushed to the spot on being informed but they didn’t have personal protection equipment (PPE), thus they stood at a distance from the body. They also called up the ambulance but it took some time for it to reach the spot,” he said.

“However, the ambulance driver and other person came to the spot without PPE. We had to then call for PPE and only by the evening could we shift the body to Sassoon hospital,” he said.

“The identity of the man is not known but we have taken his photographs for further probe,” he said.

On Friday afternoon, the body of another unidentified man was found lying near the Maharshinagar police chowky in Gultekdi. The area is a Covid-19 hotspot and none of the policemen were willing to take the risk of touching the man. The body thus lay on the footpath for almost four hours before it was shifted to Sassoon General Hospital.
