VISAKHAPATNAM: The children at the Cerebral Palsy Clinic, run by the RK Mission, with the help of their parents and trainers have taken upon themselves the task of educating the public on coronavirus and preventive measures that need to be taken to battle it. 


“Some of them have Down’s Syndrome, cerebral palsy, autism and intellectual deficiencies. However, they do understand the idea of danger and it is in their nature to take up everything they do with dedication,” observed one of the trainers, C Sri Lakshmi.

These children have been coordinating with their peers online from home. The trainers said the children are enamored by the visual training methods, which have aroused their curirosity and as a result they are able to perform such daunting tasks from home without any direct contact with their trainers and with whatever tools, means and material available at home.

Brother Anil Kumar of R K Mission, Visakhapatnam, said, “ There are 70 children of different ages. The oldest among them, who are provided basic kindergarten-level education at our special school, are spearheading the task.”

The trainers said, “They are spreading the message “Stay Home, Stay Safe” by means of a collage. Each child has been tasked with sketching one letter.”
