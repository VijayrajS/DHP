Hyderabad: A nurse working at a private hospital in Hyderabad tested positive for Covid-19 in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district on Tuesday. The nurse, who has been admitted to Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad for treatment, had travelled from Suryapet to Kothagudem on June 4 and officials are in the process of tracing her contacts.

Officials have advised her co-passengers to self-quarantine. After the lockdown restrictions were eased, she took two RTC buses to reach Kothagudem. 

“First, she hired a cab to reach LB Nagar. From there, she took an RTC bus and arrived in Suryapet along with two other friends. While her friends got down at Suryapet, the nurse boarded another bus and reached Kothagudem by 3.30 pm. As she had some symptoms, the local medical authorities tested her and her test results came back positive,” said a district official.

While the RTC bus driver has been quarantined, the rest of the passengers are yet to be traced. Nine passengers got down at Khammam, seven at Kothagudem, six in Palvancha and 10 in Bhadrachalam. Officials said details of the bus she took from LB Nagar to Suryapet are yet to be ascertained. 

Meanwhile, the district administration declared Indrapriyadarshini Colony, where the nurse resides, as a containment zone. Collector MV Reddy constituted 16 teams to test residents for coronavirus in all the houses within one km radius of the nurse’s house. Eleven members of her family were sent to a quarantine facility and their swabs were sent to Warangal. A total of 38 people were sent to a quarantine facility as she had been in touch with them after her return. On Monday, 12 of them tested negative for the disease.
