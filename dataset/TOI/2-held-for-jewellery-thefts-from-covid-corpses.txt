AHMEDABAD: Shahibaug police arrested two persons from Nikol, Ashok Patel, 30, and Amit Sharma, 28, for stealing the belongings of a woman who had died from the novel coronavirus at the Covid-19 facility at Asarwa Civil Hospital.


Bindu Rajput’s earrings, gold chain and mobile phone were stolen after she succumbed on May 11. Police sources said this was not the only theft they committed. They are suspected to have stolen jewellery from bodies on May 15 and May 16 as well.

Deputy commissioner of police, Zone 4, Neeraj Badgujar, said that while Patel is a contract worker with Civil Hospital deployed to handle bodies, Sharma is a former employee. “Both of them would steal jewellery off of dead bodies. Patel would wear a personal protective equipment (PPE) and enter the hospital so no one could recognize him and he wouldn’t be captured on CCTV cameras. We are questioning to know if they are involved in more such thefts,” added Bagdugar.

On May 11, the Congress councillor of Amraiwadi, Jagdish Rathod, had shot off a letter to the superintendent of Civil Hospital, M M Prabhakar, alleging that Rajput’s belongings had been stolen after she died of the virus. Her husband, Shivpujan Rajput, went to Civil Hospital after he was informed of her death and he discovered that the belongings were missing.

“We first checked the cameras but it was of no help as they were wearing PPE when they entered the ward and could not be recognized,” said inspector A K Patel of Shahibaug police station.

Patel said they then checked the register and learned that Patel had not been on duty since May 8 but had been seen by other employees sanitizing the bodies of Covid-19 victims. “We suspected his involvement and he later confessed to the crime and named Amit Sharma as his accomplice,” added Patel.

Badgujar said the process of recovering the stolen ornaments is underway.
