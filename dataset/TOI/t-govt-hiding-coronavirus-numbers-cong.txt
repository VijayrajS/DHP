Telangana government hiding coronavirus numbers: Congress
2020-04-28
HYDERABAD: TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy on Monday said there is a strong suspicion that the state government is concealing the number of Covid-19 positive cases and not making public the actual number of cases. 


“Why is Telangana government not allowing private hospitals and labs approved by ICMR to conduct Covid-19 tests, there has been no clear answer from KCR on this aspect. The government needs to conduct more tests and should take South Korea as an example in this regard,” he said.

Participating in a video conference conducted by CLP leader M Bhatti Vikramarka on Monday, Uttam said the rate of Covid-19 tests in Telangana was only 37 for every lakh people. Bhatti criticised the CM for confining himself to media conferences and review meetings at Pragathi Bhavan and said procurement of paddy was going at a snail’s pace.
