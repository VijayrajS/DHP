2020-06-06
Hyderabad: Millions of people die every year due to pollution and environmental degradation and climate change is also a pandemic just like Covid-19, said experts t a webinar on Covid-19 and environmental concerns hosted by department of civil engineering, Osmania University on World Environment Day on Friday.

Linking the spread of coronavirus to ecological factors, environmentalist Kajal Maheshwari said, “Coronavirus has originated from animals. Contact happens among other reasons from the loss of their habitat. Extreme weather conditions such as drought and heat destroy the natural habitat of species making them step out of forest areas, thereby, making humans more vulnerable.” 

Dr Wesam Al Madhoun, a professor from Malaysia, said, “Every year, over 3 million die of household air pollution in India, with women and children being most vulnerable. These could be because of pollution-related lung and heart disease.”

 Experts said the use of technology can help. Valli Manickam, dean, Administrative Staff College India suggested the need for biodiversity resilience mapping. 

Meanwhile, Srinivasa Chary, director, urban governance and environment, ASCI, said the current pandemic has exposed the fractures in big Indian cities.
