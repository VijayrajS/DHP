IIT Kharagpur campus goes for community lockdown to fight Covid-19
2020-04-14
KOLKATA: With 4,000-odd students and research scholars as well as several hundreds of faculty, non-teaching and support staff and their families being confined on the campus, IIT Kharagpur is running a mammoth show of tricking the Coronavirus every day.


The institute pre-poned the summer vacation, in keeping with the directions from the human resources development ministry, to April 1, hoping that students would completely clear out. But that did not happen. Many students stayed put on the campus as their residential areas were affected by the Covid-19.

However, when the institute found that the number of students, who stayed back on the campus during the summer vacation, was high, special lockdown measures were taken to thwart the attack of Covid-19.

The first challenge was to allot a separate room for each scholar. With many students having left for home on vacation, their empty rooms were accommodated for the rest staying on the campus. Every hostel is being treated as a family where one student can visit another’s room but grouping together is not allowed.

Students have been strictly instructed to stay inside their respective rooms, though they can step out to buy essentials 

“A roster is being maintained by the security at every hostel entrance and just two students at a time are allowed to leave but they have to return within half an hour. Chalk circles have been drawn outside stores at the market and only grocery, fruits and vegetables are being sold to them,” said Ninaad Lohakare, student vice president. While entering the hostel hand sanitising with an alcohol based liquid prepared by the institute’s hostel is a must.The cleaning staff, cooks and helpers, who live outside the campus, have all been accommodated inside the hostels.
