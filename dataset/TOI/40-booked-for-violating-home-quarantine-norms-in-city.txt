CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) on Friday said FIR (First Information Report) has been filed against 40 people in the city for violating home quarantine norms. Chennai corporation commissioner G Prakash warned that strict action will be taken against those violating quarantine norms. 

“A police complaint will be filed and the person and extended contacts will be shifted to Covid-care centres,” said an official release, adding that the violators run the risk of infecting others. “Apart from initiatives taken by the authorities, it is important that the public co-operate. The action was taken after several warnings,” said an official. 

Violators were booked from across 14 zones in the city, except Alandur (zone 12). Tondiarpet (zone 4) and Royapuram (zone 5) topped the list with seven violators each. 

While most asymptomatic positive patients are sent to Covid-care centres, those whose houses are equipped for home quarantine are allowed to isolate themselves within their quarters. As on date, about 3,000 people are under home quarantine in city limits, including those who returned from foreign countries and other states. 

According to the latest data provided by the civic body, there are 360 areas under containment in its limits — a number much lower when compared to the exponential growth of cases in the city — due to the revised containment norms. Now, the civic body does not bring an entire street under containment unless there is a spurt in cases and only the building or apartment complex is barricaded if occupants test positive. 

“This method has worked out to an extent as when you bring a street under containment, there were instances where people still mingle within the street and there were chances of the infection spreading,” an IAS officer part of the field support team told TOI.
