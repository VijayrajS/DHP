Coronavirus in Maharashtra: Trust advises sick devotees to avoid pilgrimage
2020-03-18
PUNE: The Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Temple Trust in Alandi has advised devotees suffering from cough, cold and fever to avoid the pilgrimage in wake of the coronavirus spread. 

“We have provided masks and sanitisers to our guards and have told them to monitor the health of devotees visiting the temple. Those having health issues will be provided medical assistance. But we urge devotees to not participate in the pilgrimage if they are unwell,” chief trustee Vikas Dhage Patil told TOI on Saturday.

On an average 20,000 devotees, from across the state, visit Alandi everyday to pay respect to the sant’s samadhi. 

“It is not possible to shut down the temple unless we get a special order from the district administration,” he added. 

The trust administration conceded that the number of devotees has reduced by almost half in the last few days. 

“Ever since Covid-19 positive cases were reported in the city, devotees have stopped visiting the temple. As per our records, around 10,000 people are visiting the temple each day, at the moment. We feel this number may decline further in the coming days,” another trust member said.

The trust has kept sanitizers where devotees form queues. They are also raising awareness about the virus.

“If anybody is suspected of running a mild fever, our staffers will conduct thermal screening. Symptomatic individuals will be sent to respective district hospitals for medical check-ups,” the trustee added. 

A senior official from the district administration told TOI, “The government has not taken any decision regarding shutting down temples as only a meagre number of devotees are visiting pilgrimage spots. We may issue an order in the coming days, if necessary.”
