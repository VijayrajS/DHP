Nashik: The Nashik rural police’s efforts in bringing down the rate of coronavirus infection among the force in Malegaon is yielding good results as not a single personnel has tested positive in the past week.

As many as 152 police personnel, including SRPF jawans, had tested positive for Covid-19 in the powerloom town and one of them succumbed to the infection until a week ago. However, 93 of those infected have been discharged from hospitals after recovery.

Superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Arti Singh said police have taken over more than 20 mangal karyalas (marriage halls) and a large number of lodges in Malegaon to accommodate SRPF jawans and local police personnel.

Six companies of SRPF, comprising 540 jawans, and around 1,000 personnel from the rural police have been deployed in Maelgaon for nearly a month.

“A maximum of 20 jawans are being put up at a time in mangal karyalas and around 10 jawans in lodges to ensure social distancing while they rest during long hours of work,” said Singh.

Police have also deployed more buses for the personnel to avoid crowding.

“These measures have started yielding results and not a single positive case of a policeman has been reported in the last one week. Except 60 jawans, all other personnel deployed in Malegaon have tested negative for Covid-19,” added Singh.

Meanwhile, police have stopped using the sprawling SRPF hostel in Malegaon, which was initially used for lodging a large number of SRPF jawans. The use of the hostel was stopped after a large number of jawans had got infected.
