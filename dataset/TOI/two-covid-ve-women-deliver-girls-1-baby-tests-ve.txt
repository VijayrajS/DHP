Madurai: Two pregnant women, who were undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai, gave birth to a healthy baby girl each via C-section in the span of three days. The samples of the babies were taken 24 hours after birth to send for testing for Covid-19. The results of one of them has returned negative while the results of the other is still awaited. Meanwhile, a 29-year-old woman from Samayanallur tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. She had given birth to a female infant at Samayanallur PHC only on Wednesday.

A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Doddappanaiakkanur in Usilampatti was referred to GRH after initially visiting the Doddappanaiakkanur primary health centre (PHC) for delivery. According to hospital authorities, she tested positive for Covid-19 on April 26 and delivered a healthy female child later the same day through C-section delivery. As per protocol, samples of the baby were sent for Covid-19 testing, which has returned negative.

Meanwhile, a 27-year-old pregnant woman from Anuppanadi Road, Teppakulam, tested positive for Covid-19 on April 27. Shortly after being admitted to GRH for treatment, on the second day, this woman, too, gave birth to a healthy baby girl via C-section delivery. 

Samples of the baby were taken for testing after 24 hours but results are still awaited, said hospital sources. Both deliveries were performed by a team of gynaecologists at the hospital equipped with personal protective equipment (PPEs). Both mothers and their infants are stable.
