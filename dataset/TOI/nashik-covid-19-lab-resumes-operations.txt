Nashik: The city-based Covid-19 laboratory set up at the Dr Vasantrao Medical college hospital and Research Centre has resumed operations started functioning as it got the equipment for the same. 

The operations of the laboratory were earlier halted due to the shortage of consumables. However, the hospital has now received all the required consumables, following which the operations of the lab have resumed.

“We have got all the equipment that were required for the laboratory and now it has resumed operations,” a senior official from Nashik civil hospital said, adding that the laboratory has stocked all the essentials and have also procured some additional stock. 

“We are learning and improvising on the processes. We now hope that there would be no halt in operations henceforth,” he added. 

The laboratory requires testing kits and consumables which are often sourced from the market.

“Though the country is dealing with Covid-19 crisis, there are some rules that have to be followed. Hence, it took longer for us to put things in place. Also, the consumables had to be sourced from the market which took some time,” the officer said. 

The laboratory had first shut down its operations on May 10 due to the shortage of consumables. Later, on May 23, the laboratory was shut for the second time.
