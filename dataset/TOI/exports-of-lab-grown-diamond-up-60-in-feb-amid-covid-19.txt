Surat: At a time when coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong and China has taken the sheen out of Surat's famed natural polished diamonds, cheap lab-grown diamonds seem to have become best friend of consumers in the United States and Dubai. While exports of natural polished diamonds have declined by almost 41% in February, exports of lab-grown diamonds registered a 60% increase during the same month.According to figures provided by Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), exports of lab-grown polished diamonds increased by 60% to Rs265 crore in February 2020 compared to Rs166 during the same month in previous year. However, total exports of lab-grown diamonds between April-February 2020 increased by 102% to Rs2,800 crore compared to Rs1,370 crore during the same period in previous year. On the other hand, exports of polished diamonds in February 2020 declined by 41% at Rs9,800 crore compared to Rs16,600 crore during the same month in previous year. Overall exports of polished diamonds between April-February 2020 declined by 19% to Rs1.24 lakh crore compared to Rs1.53 lakh crore during the same period in previous year. Industry sources said majority of lab-grown diamonds are exported to the US, where many leading jewellery brands like Zales, Kay, Jared and Signet Jewellers sell lab-grown diamonds from their stores and online platforms. Majority of lab-grown diamonds are cut and polished in Surat and the raw material is sourced from China and Singapore. Lab-grown Diamond and Jewellery Promotion Council (LGDJPC) chairman Shashikant Shah told TOI, “If consumers don’t get diamonds cheaper, they will buy lab-grown diamonds. Now, lab-grown diamonds have found acceptance in the US, Dubai, Australia and Germany. We don’t see export graph going down anytime soon.” According to Global Diamond Report-2019 by Bain & Company, most of lab-grown diamonds are purchased in the US, but produced in China and India. While China accounts for nearly 50% of global production of lab-grown gems, India produces 20% with focus on polished diamonds sales. Paul Zimnisky, New York-based independent diamond industry analyst, told TOI, “I estimate that man-made diamonds produced for jewellery will be around 5 million rough carats this year, up 35% from last year. Based on my analysis, man-made diamonds are selling 45-55% less than equivalent natural diamonds.”
