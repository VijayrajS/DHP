CHIKKABALLAPURA: With 100 Covid-19 positive cases being reported from Chikkaballapura district in the last three days, the number of those infected from the district now stands at 126.

According to deputy commissioner R Latha, 99 of them had gone to Mumbai to eke out a livelihood, while the source for the other patient is under investigation.


Six buses ferrying the people from Mumbai to their villages in Gauribidanur and Gudibande taluks were stopped at Chikkaballapura border on Wednesday. They were not allowed to enter initially as they didnâ€™t have permission, but later 265 persons were quarantined at Gudibande and Bagepalli and their throat swabs were collected for testing.

Most of the returnees stayed in slums in Mumbai where the incidence of Covid-19 is high.
