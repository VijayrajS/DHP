NASHIK: The health machinery of the civic body has been put on high alert to ensure mosquito breeding spots are not created following the recent rainfall and the dengue problem does not arise while the city is fighting the coronavirus crisis.

“There have been a few cases of dengue since the onset of the monsoon last year. But there was a sudden spike in the cases thereafter (July rain). We are already fighting against Covid-19. Hence, instructions have been given to the health machinery to ensure that mosquito breeding spots are not created in the city,” mayor Satish Kulkarni said.

The mayor conducted a meeting of health department officials and asked them to take measures to prevent outbreak of dengue.

The city had recorded only 12 cases of dengue between January 1 and June 30 in 2019, but there was a sudden spike in dengue positive cases from July onwards after the monsoon became active.

The city had recorded 48 dengue positive cases in July alone, followed by 165 and 117 cases in August and September, respectively. 

In October, 207 positive cases were registered which increased to 322 in November. The city had recorded 253 cases in December 2019.

In 2018 (Jan-Dec), 844 dengue positive cases were recorded in the city with three deaths, but the city recorded 1,124 cases of dengue positive in 2019 with two deaths.
