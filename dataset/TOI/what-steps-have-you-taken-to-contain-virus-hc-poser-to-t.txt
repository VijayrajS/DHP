Hyderabad: Sending an alert note to Telangana, the high court on Friday directed chief secretary Somesh Kumar to explain the steps the state government has taken to prevent the dreaded coronavirus from spreading in the state. 

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave time till February 26 to the CS to file his affidavit. “Your (CS) affidavit should also explain the efforts on containing swine flu, dengue, malaria, etc., besides laying special stress on the new coronavirus,” the bench said.

The case was posted to February 27. The bench gave this direction while hearing two PILs filed by Karuna of Welltech Foundation, an NGO, and advocate Rapolu Bhaskar. 

The CJ sought to know from advocate general BS Prasad on the government’s preparedness to tackle coronavirus. 

K Pavan Kumar, counsel for Karuna, reminded the court that it had directed the CS on January 10 to constitute technical committees to tackle viral fevers. “But till today, neither the committees were formed nor any reports filed,” he said. TNN
