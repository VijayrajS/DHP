Even after quarantine, Kerala Tabligh preachers can’t go home
2020-04-28
BENGALURU: Life has come a full circle for 12 Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) followers from Kerala, who are stuck in Karnataka as their home-state has allegedly turned them back, citing Covid-19 concerns and the lockdown.

Lodged at Haj Bhavan after they were found negative for Covid-19, the 12 and another Tamil Nadu preacher are now back in the same place. Only that they are now more vulnerable to contracting the infection as 17 Padarayanapura violence accused awaiting test results are giving them company at Haj Bhavan. 

According to Bheemashankar Guled, DCP (northeast), the 13 preachers were accommodated in a Yelahanka hotel for some days, but had to be moved out for various reasons. They were later shifted to a Banaswadi hotel, but protest by locals prompted their return to Haj Bhavan.

The 13 preachers and 10 Indonesian and 11 Kyrgyzstan nationals were on March 31 picked up from a mosque in Goripalya, off Mysuru Road. The 34 Tabligh followers were quarantined in Sir CV Raman General Hospital the same day. “Throat swab samples of these men were collected and the results came negative,” said Radha Krishna, medical superintendent of CV Raman Hospital. They were kept in quarantine for 14 days at the hospital.

On April 12, all 34 were discharged and sent to Haj Bhavan. As the 12 men from Kerala and one from TN expressed their desire to go home, they were sent in a mini-bus. However, Kerala police posted at the border sent them back.

“We want to be with our families. We have been here for close to a month,” a TJ follower from Kerala said. 

“This is a medical crime. The 13 people have finished their quarantine but are, unfortunately, sharing living space with 17 prisoners, some of whom could be positive. Five of their fellow accused have already tested positive,” said an inmate at the bhavan. 

“The 17 are high-risk patients and showing symptoms of mild fever and cough,” he added.
