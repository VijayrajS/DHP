CUTTACK: With the state government fearing that Odisha might be moving towards stage three or community transmission phase of Covid-19, the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) is readying 2,150 beds in 14 quarantine centres across the city. These include community centres, educational institutions, shelter homes and kalyan mandaps. They also include the Odisha Olympic Association’s Corporate Box in Barabati Stadium.


Health officer Satyabrata Mohapatra told TOI on Saturday that the civic body was readying these 14 quarantine centres as part of a Covid-19 preparedness plan. He said the arrangements to procure beds and other necessary materials for creation of the quarantine wards had been started.

“We have already created a quarantine ward of 30 beds in two quarters of the State Housing Board Colony at Nuabazar and a similar facility with 13 beds at Odisha Olympic Association’s Corporate Box in Barabati Stadium,” Mohapatra said.

The quarantine wards have been planned at Gopalpur Kalyan Mandap, OMP Community Centre, Barabati Stadium, Deula Sahi Shelter Home and National Rice Research Institute Auditorium, among others.
