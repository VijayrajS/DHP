Sensex drops over lockdown extension
2020-04-14
Mumbai: The extension of the lockdown, along with grim economic forecasts for the global economy due to Covid-19, weighed on market sentiment on Monday with the sensex closing 470 points lower at 30,690. Ahead of the PM’s Tuesday morning address, a comment by leading global strategist Chris Wood, suggesting the sensex could re-test the lows seen on March 23 if the lockdown is extended, also made investors jittery, brokers and dealers said.

On the NSE, Nifty lost 118 points to close below the psychologically important 9k mark, at 8,994 points. The day’s slide was led by banking & financial stocks with HDFC Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Bajaj Finance, along with energy-to-telecom major RIL among top drags on the index. Of the 30 index stocks, only seven closed with gains. 

The day’s selling, which came on the back of a Rs 1,244-crore net outflow by foreign funds, also left investors poorer by about Rs 1 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 119.2 lakh crore.

According to Siddhartha Khemka, head - retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, on Monday, the markets plunged tracking weak global markets, rising Covid-19 cases in India and the fears of lockdown getting extended in the country till the end of the month. “As global coronavirus cases exceed 1.8 million, the World Bank has warned that South Asia is on course for its worst economic performance in 40 years. Risk aversion has returned globally as US continued to report most number of active cases and deaths while Europe is seeing slower addition to cases and deaths,” Khemka said. 

“In India, the total cases have surpassed the 9k mark while the death is more than 300. Market participants are awaiting the outcome of the PM’s address on Tuesday.”
