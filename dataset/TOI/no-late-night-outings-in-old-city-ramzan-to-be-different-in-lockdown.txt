Lucknow: No late-night outings in Old City, Ramzan to be different in lockdown
2020-04-24
LUCKNOW: The hustle and bustle of lanes leading up to Old City with inviting aroma of delicacies at Akbari Gate and Aminabad, the markets of ‘chand raat’ (night of moon sighting for Ramzan and Eid) and people carrying ‘iftari’ to neighbourhood mosques amid prayers and merriment will be missed this year, with Ramzan beginning during the lockdown period.


The city is set to have a quiet Ramzan with not just Muslims but also some Hindus who observe the fast set to stay inside their homes instead of visiting Old City for Ramzan’s charms. 



Clerics have already asked everyone to follow the lockdown protocols completely and to pray at home.

Ramzan in Lucknow is a favourite time of the year for foodies who like to have Tunday Kebabs, Raheem’s nahari, Mubeen’s pasandey, Azhar Bhai’s paan and the pink flavourful Kashmiri chai.

Though the month is for prayer, reading the Quran and noble work, it has a second side to it where from dusk to dawn, people from all faiths are out on the streets enjoying the night.

However, this year will be different. 

Arrangements are being made by clerics and moon committees for April 24, the expected date for the crescent sighting but people have been asked to not congregate and send information over the phone if they have sighted the moon.

“Many of my friends and colleagues from all religions would come along to Akbari Gate during Ramzan nights and we would eat so many dishes exclusive to Lucknow,” said Muzammil Sheikh, a Lucknow resident.
