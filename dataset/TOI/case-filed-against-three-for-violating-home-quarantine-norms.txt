SALEM: Police registered a case against three people who were under home quarantine but found roaming in the city on Tuesday. 


Police also warned them that they would be put behind bars if they repeat the offence in future.

As many as 820 people are under home quarantine in the district while 23 people have been admitted to the Salem government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in the city with symptoms of Covid-19. 

“Of them, six people have tested positive,” collector S A Raman said. 

The health department officials have affixed stickers on the houses to identity home quarantined people. They are also keeping a check on those houses twice a day.

On Monday evening, the health department officials went to three houses at Shevapet and Kitchipalayam areas in the city. “During our checking, one person from Kitchipalayam and two from Shevapet were missing from their houses,” a senior official from the district health department said, adding that they had gone for a walk and grocery shopping.

The Kitchipalayam and Shevapet police registered cases under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous life) of the IPC against them.

Police warned that they would take severe action and register cases against those defying norms in the city.
