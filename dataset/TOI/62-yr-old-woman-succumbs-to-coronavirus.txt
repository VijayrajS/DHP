Vadodara: Vadodara recorded its second death of a COVID-19 patient at SSG Hospital on Monday morning.

The 62-year-old female was fellow-traveller of the 52-year-old male patient who passed away on Thursday last. They had got infected with the virus during a tour to Sri Lanka. The duo was a part of a group of six couples from the city who had toured Sri Lanka.

The male victim’s wife (who was also a fellow-traveller) apart from his daughter, son and daughter-in-law were earlier discharged from the hospital after they tested negative in repeat tests.

After returning from the neighbouring country, the 62-year-old resident of Tandalja Road fell ill and was on March 18 admitted to government hospital where she tested positive for coronavirus.

The female victim was critical since last couple of days. Since Sunday afternoon, she was on ventilator. “She also had other comorbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes and chronic bronchitis,” said Dr Rajeev Daveshwar, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital.

After the patient passed away at around 10am, her body was cremated at Khaswadi crematorium in Karelibaug in the presence of a couple of relatives.

The victim’s husband, who has tested negative for COVID-19, is currently under treatment at a private hospital for other medical ailments, sources said.

With the death of this female patient, there is no COVID-19 positive patient in the isolation ward of SSG Hospital. All the positive patients will be treated at GMERS Gotri Medical College and Hospital while screening and testing of samples will continue at SSG Hospital, they added.
