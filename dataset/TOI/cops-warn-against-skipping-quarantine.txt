THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State police will act against those who cheat authorities by breaking their train travel in between and then arriving at their destination in their own vehicle to avoid quarantine. State police chief Loknath Behera urged all district police chiefs to take strict action against such persons who violate their travel plan. Their details can be accessed from the arogya jagratha portal of the government where they would have registered. 

CM Pinarayi Vijayan had directed the police to take action against persons hiding their travel details after alighting at stations which are not mentioned at the government portal. His decision came following an incident in Pathanamthitta where a woman from Bengaluru came for a medical emergency at a hospital. After her death, the relatives admitted that she had come from Bengaluru. The entire hospital, where she did her angioplasty, had to be shut till her result came back as negative. 

Police considered this as an attempt to evade the 14-day quarantine by covering up travel details and cheating authorities. Police decided to have a discussion with railway authorities and take steps to identify such people who cheat authorities. 

Apart from this, police have also taken seriously the incidents that are reported from various parts that the passengers – coming by air or train – are visiting their relatives on their way home where they undergo room quarantine. 

Highway police, control room and police stations have been asked to ensure strict monitoring of persons who are arriving at airports, railway stations and via checkposts.
