NAINITAL: Amid growing Coronavirus scare in the country, the Nainital district administration on Friday directed the tourism department to keep an eye out for foreigners travelling to the Lake Town and report any suspected cases to the health department at the earliest.


The administration also advised people to avoid crowded places, fairs or activities where chances of contracting the disease are high.

Nainital district magistrate (DM) Savin Bansal said, “We held a meeting with several departments, including health, tourism and panchayati raj to assess and take a comprehensive review of the Coronavirus situation in Nainital. Since it is a major tourist attraction and people from across the country come here, we have directed the tourism department to keep an eye on all the hotels and see if anyone is exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms. Special focus will be on people coming from abroad.”

Speaking about measures taken by the administration to prevent the virus’s outbreak, the mayor said, “We have set up special quarantine wards at all major hospitals in the district to treat suspected cases of coronavirus. Special informative programmes will also be organized across panchayats to inform people about ways to protect themselves from the virus.”
