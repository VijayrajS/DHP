Many forced to miss relatives’ last rites due to lockdown

VISAKHAPATNAM: VS Kumar got a call on Wednesday from Mumbai stating that his uncle had passed away in a private hospital, where he was being treated for non-coronavirus related health issues.

The call triggered trepidation as Kumar could not think of a way to get the body home. “I felt helpless. All transport services have been suspended. All we could do was mourn,” said Kumar. 

While people have been talking about the economic toll of this pandemic, few are discussing its emotional toll, especially people who are losing their loved ones in this time. 

“First the lockdown, followed by suspension of transport has been difficult for people whose kin died in some other city or distant place,” said George Cheedy, president of Waltair Cemetery. He said the Waltair Cemetery, alone, received only six bodies for burial since March 21, whereas it usually gets at least two to four bodies per day.

“Only two to four people came with the body against hundreds of people earlier. We also take only five to 10 minutes for burial works against more than one hour earlier,” Cheedy told TOI. 

K Mutyalu, a watchman at a Hindu cremation ground at Gnanapuram, said people are afraid of visiting the graveyard due to the Covid-19 scare. “People came with face masks and maintained social distance. But some were even scared to touch the dead body at the time of last rites,” Mutyalu said, adding that there has been no rituals since the lockdown began.

A Muslim community leader said they are mulling coming up with rules, such as limiting the gathering at graveyards to 10 to 20, for the current lockdown period.

The WHO recently clarified that bodies of Covid-19 patients can either be cremated or buried. It described as myth, the argument that bodies of Covid-19 patients should be cremated.
