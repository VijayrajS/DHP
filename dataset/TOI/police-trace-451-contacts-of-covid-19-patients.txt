Pune: The designated coronavirus team of the city police has so far traced 451 people coming in contact with Covid-19 patients.

The 15-member crime branch team was constituted five day ago to assist the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) after several contacts of patients were found to be missing.

Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale said, “The PMC gave us a list of 490 patients, who had tested positive for coronavirus, for identifying the people coming in contact with them in the last 14 days. The list gives details like name, address and cellphone numbers of patients.”

He said, “Our team conducted technical investigations like analysing the phone calls made by the patients. Phone calls were made to the contacts of the patients to trace their locations and convince them to cooperate with the PMC. We have submitted the list of 451 identified contacts of the patients to the civic body for keeping them in home or institutional quarantine.”

Morale said, “The PMC classified the contacts into primary, low risk and secondary contacts. Its medical staffers are also collecting history from the patients for identifying their contacts.”

He said, “The technical investigation for identifying the contacts is important because some patients are not in a proper state of mind to share information, while a few conceal information.”
