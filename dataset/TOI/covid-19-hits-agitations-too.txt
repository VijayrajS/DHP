Covid-19 hits agitations too
2020-03-12
T’puram: Concerns over increase in number of Covid-19 cases in the state has hit the protesters engaged in various agitations in the city, especially on the footpath in front of the secretariat.

The agitators involved in the protest against CAA in front of the secretariat called off their agitation that was going on for more than a month in view of the unsafe conditions prevailing over the virus outbreak in the state. The agitators on Wednesday dismantled their makeshift tent under which they were staging the protest and cleared the place. 

Another major group that is staging an agitation nearby, Justice for Walayar Kids Forum, is also toying with the idea of calling off the agitation until favourable conditions return. They cancelled a collective hunger strike of 50 agitators to mark the 50th day of the agitation on Wednesday. 

“The members of our forum were staging relay hunger strike. We will hold discussions and will take a decision,” said forum convener Prasad Somarajan, adding that going on with the protest will only put the lives of their members as well as others at risk. 

The police said that they did not ask the agitators to clear the spot and it was the agitators’ own decision to do so. Anti-CAA protesters and Walayar Kids Forum were the only two major groups that were staging agitations in front of the secretariat at present. Barring them there are three protests by individuals going on at the spot. All three individuals are still continuing their agitation.
