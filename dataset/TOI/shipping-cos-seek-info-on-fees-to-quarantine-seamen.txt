COLVA: With the state government in the process of sorting out the issue of bringing the 8,000-odd seafarers back to the state, sources at the office of the commissioner for NRI affairs said that there have been inquiries from shipping companies regarding the available quarantine facilities and their willingness to pay for the same.

When contacted, the NRI affairs’ nodal officer, home department, Anthony D’Souza, said, “There are some companies who are looking to pay some amount. I can’t confirm this figure to you, but I have understood that it is approximately Rs 35,000 per seafarer, which is their contribution. This has come from two companies. But I do not know whom they will pay it to. We do not have any written proposal and there is nothing official about it.”

D’Souza also told TOI that as they communicate with various stakeholders, his office “gets offers from the organisations, including the shipping companies, that they are ready to lend whatever assistance they feel that they can provide”.

“The Goa government has made its own quarantine facility. Besides, additional facilities have also been short listed,” he added. The nodal officer for NRI affairs also said that these shortlisted facilities include hotels.

“Those who do not want to avail of the free facility offered by the government have an option of going to the paid facility. That is their (seafarer’s) choice, we are not asking them to go there,” D’Souza said.
