2020-05-24
NAGPUR: Samples of around 75 cops from the city and five from the state reserve police force (SRPF) were collected by the team of Mayo Hospital staffers after the drive to test police personnel kicked off on Saturday. One of the rooms of the Lakadganj police station was converted into a makeshift sampling station.

It’s learnt that around 872 cops from different units, including the SRPF, deployed at containment zones, would be tested in the coming days. Around 35 cops from city police and 28 SRPF personnel are now in quarantine. Senior inspector of Shanti Nagar police station is also home quarantined. 

The top brass of the city police decided to go ahead with the testing of samples of their personnel in the backdrop of two of their constables and six SRPF personnel turning positive while serving in the Mominpura containment zone. “Chances of several cops, including a few officers, being detected as asymptomatic carriers are high,” said a police personnel. He welcomed the testing. 

A few days ago, city police and NMC had jointly filed a petition to go ahead with the testing their personnel who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Though NMC decided otherwise, city police wanted to go ahead with their earlier plans of testing their cops, especially the ones deployed in containment zones from where their first two positive cases were reported. 

CP BK Upadhyay said the testing cannot be deferred for the betterment of the force and welfare of their families. “We already have eight men positives. There is a need to find out if there are any more positives among our personnel and isolate them so that their families are saved,” said the CP. 

“We have been engaged in every possible high risk job and standing round the clock at containment zones which further make us susceptible,” he said. 

It’s also learnt that the city police have earmarked Tehsil police station and another NMC clinic in Mominpura for conducting the testing. 

Under chief medical officer, Dr Sandeep Shinde, the city police hospital has already geared up with a 16-bedded isolation facility. Around 20 ventilators would be provided by the Indian medical association (IMA) to the city police hospital, said Dr Shinde. Another four private hospitals have been roped in with ventilator facility which would treat Covid-19 patients from city police. “Homeopathic and allopathy booster dosages have been repeatedly given to the police personnel and we are screening them every day both at the police station and also at the place of deployment,” he said.
