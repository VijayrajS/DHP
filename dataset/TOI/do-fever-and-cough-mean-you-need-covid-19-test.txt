Do fever and cough mean you need Covid-19 test?
2020-03-12
NEW DELHI: Who should get tested for the novel coronavirus is a question that has left several people anxious. Anyone and everyone with flu symptoms are seeking to test themselves for Covid-19.


To check the panic, India’s top health research body, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has come up with a guideline on who should get the test done and who shouldn’t. It stated that there was currently no community transmission of the virus in the country. “The disease is primarily reported in individuals with travel history to affected countries or close contacts with positive cases. Therefore, all individuals need not be tested,” the advisory said.

According to ICMR, those who have travelled to high-risk countries — China, Japan, Italy and Iran — in the past 14 days need to first quarantine themselves for two weeks. If there are no symptoms —fever, dry cough and shortness of breath — during this period, tests are not required, the guidelines clarified.



 
 

If someone hasn’t travelled to the high-risk nations but has had close contact with an infected individual, even then, ICMR suggested such persons should first home quarantine themselves for two weeks. If they develop symptoms during this period, then tests for Covid-19 may be required, it added.

In case a person requires testing, the ICMR officials said directly visiting a designated hospital was not advisable as the person might infect others. “All the states have deployed ambulances at strategic locations across the cities. The person can call the Union health ministry’s helpline number — 011-23978046 — and the surveillance team will get in touch with them,” said an official.
