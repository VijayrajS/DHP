Muzaffarnagar: Suhail Tyagi, 30, who along with his wife and a four-year-old daughter had set off for a pilgrimage to Iran on February 18, is currently stranded at a hotel in Tehran. Tyagi and his family was supposed to return to India via Dubai but was rendered helpless after Dubai cancelled all incoming flights from Iran due to outbreak of new coronavirus.

The family has now reached out to India embassy in Tehran for assistance.

Suhail’s father Inam Ilahi, a retired government employee, said, “They were scheduled to be back to India on February 24. But Kuwait Airways suspended their flights to and from Iran after the west Asian nation reported outbreak of the virus. Later, they booked flight tickets from other airlines via Dubai, but they have been told all airlines have suspended their flights from Iran.”

“They have contacted the Indian embassy in Tehran. The officials are in touch with them and hopefully, help will reach them soon,” Ilahi added.

The family was on a pilgrimage to Imam Reza shrine, the mausoleum of Imam Reza, the eighth Imam of Twelver Shiites, in Mashhad, Khorasan-e-Razavi.

Meanwhile, Iran’s health ministry on Sunday raised the nationwide death toll from the new coronavirus to 54 as the number of infected cases jumped overnight to 978 people. 

Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran's most important Shiite shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran's civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to the public have not been uniformly followed.

The virus, which originated in central China, has infected at least seven government officials in Iran.
