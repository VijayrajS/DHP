2020-03-31
KOLKATA: Residents of an upscale highrise in Bhowanipore had to break the lockdown restrictions and rush out of their homes on Monday morning after a fire broke out on a16th floor flat of the G+20 tower. One flat was completely gutted while another was partially damaged after a gas cylinder went off due to the intensive heat. Around 10 tenders were pressed into service to bring the fire under control. None was reportedly injured or trapped inside the building. 


The fire, suspected to have been caused by a short circuit at South City Galaxy on Justice Chandra Madhab Road off Ashutosh Mukherjee Avenue in Bhowanipore, was noticed around 10am. The flat (16A), where the fire broke out, belongs to the businessman Anirduddh Modi, who deals in real estate and tea. Modi, his wife and two children raised an alarm and alerted the building’s security guards. Other residents of the building were alerted about the fire through intercom. 

The tenders took over four hours to douse the fire around 2.30pm. The residents of the building stood huddled on the ground car parking lot as the fire had been raging for several hours. Though fire officials brought a hydraulic lift, they could not use it as the fire reached a higher level by then. 

The fire videos clicked by locals went viral on social media in a few minutes. Local councillor Ashim Bose said, “The fire brigade had a harrowing time dousing the flames. Lockdown restrictions could not be followed due to the incident. Food was served to the residents of the building in the community centre. They returned to their respective flats only after electricity was restored.” Fire minister Sujit Bose and fire services director general Jag Mohan visited the spot.
