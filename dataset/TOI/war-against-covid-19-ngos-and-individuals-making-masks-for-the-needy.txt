2020-04-16
Bhopal: Now that district administration has made it compulsory for everyone to wear masks while stepping out for important work, the demand for the masks has suddenly increased. Many self-help groups, entrepreneurs, individuals as well as NGOs have taken it upon themselves to make home-made, fabric masks for the corona warriors and the needy, so that they stay safe.Mahashakti NGO in collaboration with municipal authorities has made around 7000 fabric masks for people living in the slums, as they can’t afford to purchase the masks from the market. "We bought cotton cloth in bulk and distributed it among our NGO workers who have sewing machines at home. The cloth is cut into manageable pieces and washed before the process of making the masks begins. After the masks are stitched, the ladies wash them with detergent and dip them in liquid sanitizer. We have manufactured around 7000 masks till now and distributed them to sanitation workers, policemen at check-posts and people in slum areas," said Pooja Iyengar of the NGO.Another NGO, Sahara Saksharta Education and Social Welfare Society, has also taken up the task of making masks during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The NGO has branches all over Madhya Pradesh and has involved many youngsters as well as homemakers to make these masks. Many individuals are funding the NGOs to buy the cloth and make more masks.Lakshmi Dongre, a tailor, has also started making masks with the leftover pieces of fabric."I wash all the leftover pieces of cloth lying with me and then make masks out of them. I’m only using cotton fabric as other fabrics don’t allow people to breathe freely. I’m able to make only 5-10 masks per day and distribute them to the sanitation workers who come to collect the garbage and sweep the locality in the morning, milkman and vegetable vendors who cannot afford to buy the masks," said Dongre, a resident of Jawahar Chowk.
