Dehradun: Kamal Singh Yadav from Haryana could not hold back his tears when his mother gave him a flying kiss from the other end of the smartphone screen during the Passing Out Parade at IMA on Saturday. He had waited almost a decade for this day. With a tinge of sadness on his tone, he said, “When the day finally came, my family could not be here with me.”

Yet to make up for the loss, the staff and instructors at the academy pinned the stars on the shoulders of the Gentlemen Cadets (GCs) as the dear and near ones joined in the celebrations from across the phone screen.

IMA officials had earlier announced that parents and relatives of the passing-out batch will not be in attendance to watch the POP of the summer batch keeping in view the restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

AK Kushwaha from Varanasi said that his parents had purchased new clothes for the occasion almost three months in advance yet couldn’t make it to the ceremony. “It was heart-breaking when we came to know that our parents won’t be there for the parade, which is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion for any Army officer,” he added. 

AS Mankotia from Himachal Pradesh, a fourth generation Army officer, regretted that he couldn’t click a group photo with his uncles and brothers, like his other siblings.

Those hailing from Dehradun and adjoining areas said they considered themselves the most unlucky group of all. Abhishek Negi, whose parents reside in Baliwala which is barely a kilometre away from the academy, said, “Despite being so near, they couldn’t make it.”

“We wish our parents could have come,” added Heera Singh Rawat from Prem Nagar in Dehradun.
