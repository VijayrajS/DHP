Coronavirus: BMC to use rapid tests for health staff
2020-04-05
MUMBAI: Come Monday, the BMC will start using rapid blood tests to screen for coronavirus among 1,000 of its healthcare staff. The test will be voluntary as Indian Council for Medical Research has not yet come up with guidelines on the use of the rapid kits.


Given the rapid spread of the virus among healthcare workers in the city with more than 20 doctors, nurses and helpers testing positive over the past two weeks, the authorities said the screening test would help establish how many are vulnerable. 

Rapid tests look for antibodies for the virus that develop as an immunological response in blood. The Covid-19 rapid tests will not diagnose if the person has the virus; nasal and throat swabs are needed to diagnose the virus. The BMC decision comes two days after the Centre and the state announced these tests would help screen for the virus. "It is not mandatory, it is voluntary. Any doctor, nurse or helper can undergo the test if they feel the need," said additional municipal commissioner S Kakani. BMC has tied up with a pharma firm that will provide the tests at Rs 350 each.
