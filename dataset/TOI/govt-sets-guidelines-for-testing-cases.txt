Govt sets guidelines for testing cases
2020-04-21
Panaji: The directorate of health services (DHS) has fixed a standard operating procedure (SOP) for sample collection and testing of Covid-19 suspects.

All symptomatic people with travel history in the last 14 days will be tested. 

Those who have come in contact with a laboratory confirmed case, health workers, a hospitalised patient with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or pneumonia, will also be tested. 

Persons who were at Covid-19 hotspots, stayed in migration or evacuees centres, will also be tested. Similarly persons with influenza like symptoms — fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose — are also to be tested. 

It has also been decided to test direct and high-risk contacts — those living in the same household with a confirmed case and healthcare workers who have examined a confirmed case without adequate protection as per World Heath Organisation (WHO) recommendation — once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact.
