Authorities said the quarantine was as per the COVID-19 medical protocol and there is no need to panic as none of the students has shown any sign of unease. Chief medical officer health, West Midnapore, Dilip Chandra Bera said on Thursday, “They have only been kept in isolation since they have returned from Thailand. It is now a standard operating protocol as per the directives of the central and state governments.”

Bera said, “They have their examinations from February 17. They will be writing the exams at the hospital and hostel rooms. We are coordinating with hospital authorities for this,” he said. 

The first student was put in isolation immediately after he reached on February 10 while the others were quarantined the next day. “The isolation will continue for 14 days,” a medical officer at the hospital said.

The students are being given normal food and are under observation. Several calls made to institute registrar BN Singh went unanswered.
