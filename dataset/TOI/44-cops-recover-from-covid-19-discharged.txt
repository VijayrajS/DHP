In a press statement, director general of police (DGP) D Gautam Sawang said that forty-five persons had contracted the disease on the job in the last two months. So far, one police personnel–assistant sub-inspector of police Habibullah attached to Hindupur police station in Anantapur—succumbed to the disease. 

Sawang had personally handed over an ex-gratia cheque of Rs 50 lakh to Habibullah’s family members. The DGP had also written a letter to all police personnel’s family acknowledging the cops’ sacrifice. The cops’ direct family members, who were primary contacts, have also been quarantined.
