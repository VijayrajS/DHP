Mangaluru: The authorities heaved a sigh of relief after the reports of a 27-year-old man, who died in a private hospital here on Tuesday, turned out to be negative for coronavirus.

The man from Surathkal, 18km from here, suffered from acute stomach pain and breathing issues since the past four days. Worker at a chicken shop in the city, he was under medical care at a nursing home in Surathkal. He was shifted to a private hospital in Mangaluru after his condition aggravated on Tuesday. He died within minutes of reaching the hospital, said district health and family welfare officer Ramachandra Bairy.

An official communique confirmed the overnight development after the throat swab of the deceased youth was sent for tests. Dr Y Bharath Shetty, Mangaluru City North MLA, affirmed the same in a tweet. “Testing is completed and it’s COVID Negative. The person who expired yesterday was due to some other Health Ailments. There is no need to panic related to said case (sic),” he tweeted.

Surathkal forms part of his constituency.

Dr Bairy said the deceased had no history of either domestic and or foreign travel and did not meet anyone declared Covid-19 positive. The district had remained Covid-19 free for the past 10 days and the number of active cases has dropped to three and nine patients have been discharged thus far.
