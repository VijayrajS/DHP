2020-04-27
NAWADA: Two policemen were suspended and sent to jail for issuing a transit ‘permit’ after extracting Rs 500 from commuters who violated the lockdown rules.


After a video grab went viral on Saturday which showed ASI Ramadhar Prasad Yadav and constable Bhupendra Yadav (both posted at Sitamarhi police station under Rajauli sub-division), extracting money from people violating the lockdown, Nawada SP Hari Prasath directed Rajauli SDPO Sanjay Kumar to probe the matter and submit a report.

Acting on the SDPO’s report, which found the charges against the two cops true, the SP on Sunday ordered their suspension and an FIR was also lodged with the Sitamarhi police station. They were arrested and forwarded to judicial custody.

It may be recalled that the ASI not only stopped the commuters travelling on Sitamarhi-Hisua road and charged Rs 500 from them, but also gave them his c4ell phone number with an advice that in case they were stopped during the course of their onward journey, he can be contacted assistance. About half-a-dozen people were forced to pay for the ‘transit permit’.
