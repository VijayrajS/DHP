2020-04-19
Nashik: A Covid-19 testing laboratory is being set up at Dr Vasantra Pawar Medical College in Adgaon and is expected to start functioning from Monday if the sample testing under the observation of experts from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur, on Sunday is successful. 

The rise in numbers of Covid-19 positive cases in Nashik district has called for the setting up of the laboratory in the district. Dhule and Jalgaon districts have already set up similar laboratories.

The throat swab samples from Malegaon and Satana were sent to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Dhule. The burden on the Dhule lab was increasingly high as the samples from Dhule aas well as Nandurbar were also sent to the GMCH for testing. 

Samples from other 13 talukas of Nashik district are being sent to the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune for testing which is time-consuming. However, with the setting up of the new laboratory, the authorities are expecting the samples to be tested faster and in more numbers. 

“We were in need of a laboratory considering the number of cases on the rise to expedite the Covid-19 testing and starting of appropriate treatment to the patients. We will see the laboratory functional soon,” district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said. 

Collector of Nashik Suraj Madhare said that necessary permissions for setting up of the laboratory were being obtained. “The process of obtaining the necessary permissions is under way. The physical infrastructure is in place,” the officer said.

Sources from the district administration said that a larger part of the laboratory equipment was being provided by city-based Datar Genetic while other things were being sourced from the market.
