2020-04-08
LUCKNOW: Holding attendees of Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi responsible for spurt in Covid-19 positive cases, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has demanded that the Centre should ban the Jamaat and investigate into its source of funding.


Talking to TOI on Tuesday, VHP’s working president Alok Kumar said, “Not only the bank accounts of Tablighi Jamaat be confiscated but its key office-bearers should also be arrested. Members of the Jamaat are responsible for the spread of coronavirus which has claimed the lives of many people.”

He alleged that the members of Jamaat were deliberately opposing treatment and misbehaving with nurses and paramedical staff.

A week ago, VHP had termed Tablighi Jamaat a “factory of coronavirus” and said it could foil the government’s efforts of enforcing complete lockdown.

“The entire country is in serious trouble due to the activities of Tablighi Jamaat and Nizamuddin Markaz,” Kumar said.

Another VHP leader said: “When the entire country was heaving a sigh of relief that the rise in number of coronavirus cases was just 2.8% in first three weeks of March, the number of coronavirus cases jumped to over 48% by the end of March due to Jamaat’s event.”

“Many continue to hide in mosques. Due to this, the possibility of community transmission of the virus has risen,” he claimed.
