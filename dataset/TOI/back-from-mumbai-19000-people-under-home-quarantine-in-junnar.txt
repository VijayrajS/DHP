PUNE: Close to 19,000 people, mostly migrants who returned from Mumbai to their villages in Junnar taluka before the nationwide lockdown was imposed, have been put under home quarantine as a precautionary measure in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. 


Junnar tehsildar Hanumant Kolekar said the administration has formed 40 teams for regular health checks of these people. Most of them travelled by public transport and vehicles carrying vegetables from markets in Mumbai.

“The taluka has 184 villages, several hamlets, spread across hilly areas. The sources of livelihood are inadequate. Most of the people from Junnar work in big cities such as Mumbai and Pune. Our teams are visiting them every day,” he said.

At present, over 20,000 people are under home quarantine in rural Pune, said chief officer Ayush Prasad of the Pune zilla parishad. “Early detection of the virus-affected case, if any, is our first and foremost priority in the district. We have accordingly formulated our strategy. The Kerala government also managed to control the situation because of this tactic in their rural areas,” he said.

“Asha workers were working in tandem with the primary health centres across the district. We have specifically told them to inform those in charge of the health centre if they come across any person with symptoms such as cough, cold and fever. Our health centres are equipped with ambulances to shift patients, if needed,” Prasad said.

In Velhe taluka, all 106 people under home quarantine in 74 gram panchayats have tested negative. The administration also told those travelling from the city to villages to quarantine themselves as a precautionary measure.
