MEERUT: Muzaffarnagar police and administration swung into action and took a host of measures to check the spread of coronavirus in the district after a man tested positive for the contagious disease in neighbouring Kairana district.


District magistrate (DM) Selva Kumari directed all village heads to immediately inform the authority about people who have come from outside the country. While SSP Abhishek Yadav has appealed to people to not to visit police stations for any case and register their complaints over phone.

Speaking to TOI, SSP Yadav said, “We have issued a helpline number, 9690112112, on which any individual can call and register his complaint. He can also send his written complaint on WhatsApp. Proper action will be taken on that including police visit at the site. The whole exercise is to minimize assembling of people at one place.” 

Health department too has initiated a door-to-door exercise of checking suspect patients in villages. “We are not leaving anything to chance. Our 12 teams comprising doctors and paramedic staff are conducting door-to-door checking in villages to ensure there is no case anywhere. Special care is being taken of families where any member has recently arrived either from abroad or a different state.”
