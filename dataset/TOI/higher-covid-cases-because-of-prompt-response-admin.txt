Higher Covid-19 count due to accurate sampling: Bhopal administration
2020-06-14
BHOPAL: District administration officials in Bhopal claim there are more positive cases reported in the city as administration has already identified vulnerable areas and targeting those areas to ensure that disease is detected early and proper treatment is provided. 

District collector Tarun Pithode urged people to adhere to social distancing norms and all other safety guidelines. Talking to TOI, Pithode said, “We have done highest sampling when it comes to per million population. We are more focused in areas which are more prone to positive cases, and are taking samples from those areas. Thus in case we know that in particular area there could be 10 positive cases and we take 20 samples from that area, our positive rate would be 50 per cent. Our priority is to identify patients early and ensure appropriate, timely treatment.”

“If samples are taken from non-prone areas, then positive rate would be low. But that is not important; it is more important to identify suspects and provide treatment on time. People should only do two things - wear mask and keep social distance”, he said and added, “We are following protocols in totality. We are carrying out a lot of awareness campaigns. In areas such as Jehangirabad which was a hotspot, we cleared it and controlled it.”

 Urging the people, Pithode said, “Markets are open, people need to be cautious. We are very focused on vulnerable areas, we have done more than 70000 samples, our contact tracing is best.”

 Sources said that as the local markets have opened and movement of people has been allowed, it is important for everyone to follow strict safety protocols. An official wishing anonymity said, “There is no miracle that could prevent or cure Covid-19, it is just social distancing, wearing mask, washing hands and avoiding touch as much as possible that will keep us safe”.
