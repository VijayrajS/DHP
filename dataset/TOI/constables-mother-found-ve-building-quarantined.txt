PUNE: A building at Vishrantwadi police colony on Alandi road was put under quarantine on Saturday after a police constable’s mother was found to be Covid-19 positive on Friday. The on-duty constable, posted with the Yerawada police station, had also come into contact with six to seven constables over the last three days, the police said.

The constable’s swab test reports showed he had not been infected but he is under self-quarantine. The police also sanitized the area on Friday evening. A couple of police constables are guarding the building and no one is allowed in or out of the building, a senior police officer told TOI. The other policemen with whom the constable had been in contact also underwent swab tests. Four policemen have tested negative so far. 

“His mother had gone to Dighi for a couple of days. Upon her return, she fell ill. Their relatives at Dighi also underwent tests and their reports were negative,” the police officer said. The constable’s mother has been admitted to Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital in Pimpri.

Meanwhile, the Dattawadi police station have installed bells at check points. The bells are rung every hour to remind on-duty policemen to leave their place and thoroughly wash their hands and face with soap.
