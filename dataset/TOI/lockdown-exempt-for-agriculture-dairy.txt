2020-03-25
HYDERABAD: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday announced that the crucial agriculture and dairy sectors in rural areas have been exempted from the purview of the lockdown, and that MGNREGA and irrigation works would also continue.


“Agriculture and dairy in rural areas will remain unaffected until further orders to ensure regular supply of food and milk to the people. However, more than five farmers will not be allowed to gather at any one place and it would be ensured that they maintain a distance of atleast five feet,” said the chief minister.

To ensure that farmers do not gather at the procurement centres and market committees located in towns, the government has decided to set up procurement centres in each village. “Procurement centres will go to the doorsteps of the farmers. A centre to procure paddy will be set up in each of the 12,751 villages in the state. To prevent farmers from gathering at procurement centres, token system with time slots would be given,” said an official. 

Though the lockdown and economic slowdown have dented the state’s revenues, the state government will spend Rs 25,000 crore to procure paddy seeds from farmers. The CM minister has issued directions to the finance ministry in this regard. The state is expecting bumper paddy crop of over 70.7 lakh metric tonnes.
