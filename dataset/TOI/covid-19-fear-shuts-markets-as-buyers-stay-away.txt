Covid-19 fear shuts markets as buyers stay away
2020-03-22
Rajkot: Ahead of Sunday’s Janta Curfew, main markets in Rajkot remained closed on Saturday voluntarily. Traffic on the road too remained very slow and the city almost kept itself under a self imposed ‘lockdown’ kind of a situation. 

However, in midst of this, panic buying is pushing prices of essential commodities, especially green vegetables abnormally high. 

Accroding to the trade association the major markets of the old city area like Dharmendra Road, Ghee Kanta Road, Lakhaji Raj Road, Kotharia Naka, Gundavadi, Sadar remained closed. The markets in newly developed areas like Kalavad road and 150feet Ring Road also remained closed. The Racecourse Circle, a favorite hangout for the citizens, wore a deserted look during the day. 

According to the traders, fearing a lockdown people are going on a buying frenzy leading to prices of essential commodities like vegetables increase by more than 25 percent on Saturday. President of Dharamendra Road Traders Association, Nand Kalyani, along with other traders took a decision on Friday night to close down all the markets of the old city area. The trade leaders also went to the market to convince those people who kept their shops open on Saturday.
