GURUGRAM: As the number of Covid-19 cases are seeing a constant rise, the district administration is regularly battling the lack of ambulances for Covid-19 patients. To address this issue, they have decided to add 20 more ambulances to its existing fleet. 


The department at present has 21 ambulances, of which four were procured through CSR initiative. In all, till now the city had only eight ambulances for Covid-19 patients and the rest for other patients. With this addition, there will be 28 ambulances dedicated to the Covid-19 patients.



While talking about the new 20 ambulances that the district administration plans to buy, an official said, “Sixteen of them will be basic life support ambulances and four will be advanced life support ambulances. They will be bought at the rates prescribed by the National Health Mission.”

“These additional ambulances are being arranged so that Covid-19 patients do not face any difficulty to reach hospitals. While the number of asymptomatic patients are higher, there are Covid-19 patients who are critical and require emergency services. These ambulances will help them. Taking into account the present situation, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri has decided to provide 20 more ambulances to the health department,” a district administration official said. 

The new ambulances will also have the provision of GPS tracking to help residents know their location. The health department has also strengthened its ambulance service helpline (108) and has increased the number of operators running the helpline to 12. 

Earlier there was only one operator. 

Meanwhile, CEO GMCBL Sonal Goel —who is also supervising government health facilities for bed and ventilator management — visited the ESI Hospital and Medeor hospital on Tuesday and had a detailed discussion with the authorities about the facilities at the hospitals.
