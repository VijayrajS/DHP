Covid-19 fear may affect bat population in Hyderabad, say biologists

HYDERABAD: The misconceptions about bats spreading novel coronavirus may adversely affect the population of the nocturnal animal in the city, said experts.


From excessive usage of disinfectants to curb Covid-19 to habitat loss, wildlife conservationists and bat biologists are speculating various reasons that can be a threat to the bat species. 

Although no official data on the total population of bats across the city is available, experts say 16 species of bats exist in the city currently. 

They reside in buildings, caves, hollow trees and even barks of the trees.

Pradeep Nair, founder of Animal Warriors Conservation Society said, “After a video of a bat rescue that we did went viral on social media last week, we received nearly six to seven calls from people asking us for suggestions on how to get rid of bats and their roosting sites in different areas of the city. People have developed an unnecessary fear of bats due to rumours and misconceptions about them being a source of Covid-19.” 

Further stressing on the fact that bats are not proven to be the source of Covid-19, experts said that it is an accusation that is putting the flying mammals at risk. 

Speaking to TOI, Rahul Prabhukhanolkar, a research associate at Indian Bat Conservation and Research Unit said, “While one of the reasons for decline in bat population in urban areas is habitat loss, heavy use of insecticide or pesticides creates a problem for them to find food and survive..” 

Biologists stress that bats are a boon to the ecosystem and do not contain strains of Covid-19. “There is no proven fact that bats are carrying strains of Covid-19. This unnecessary anxiety that people are having about bats is baseless,” said C Srinivasulu, a city-based bat biologist and conservation zoologist.
