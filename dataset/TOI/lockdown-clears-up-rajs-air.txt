JAIPUR: Lockdown has significantly improved the state’s air quality. However, there was a slight spike in the pollution levels on Sunday evening after people burst crackers in response to PM Narendra Modi’s appeal to only light candles to to “challenge the darkness” spread by the coronavirus crisis.


Rajasthan Pollution Control Board after analysing various parameters said air quality in several cities across the state including Jaipur over the past few days was ‘good’. 

The Air Quality Index (AQI) of the state capital, which hovered between 150 and 200 in February, is now recording 65 mg-per-cubic-metre.

Drastic measures to curb Covid-19 spread such as shutdown of factories, commercial establishments and vehicular movement have resulted in a massive drop in pollution levels.

According to pollution control board data, there has been a 40% drop in pollutants from February to April.

“Apart from industrial smoke, dust due to the vehicular movement also adds to pollution. Likewise, with the change of wind patterns, we get pollutants. However, post lockdown, we are neither witnessing industrial smoke, nor emission of dust since there is negligible vehicular movement,” said Vijay Singhal, chief environmental engineer, state pollution control bureau, Rajasthan.

“Also because of negligible vehicular pollution, there has also been a dip of almost 70 per cent nitrogen dioxide levels,” Singhal said.

After the lockdown on March 22, there has been a drastic dip in AQI levels. “Jaipur’s AQI which generally stays at 150 on a normal day, witnessed levels of 85, 65, 54 on March 22, 23 and 24, respectively. Also the average in March was 130 compared to 160 in February,” said a senior officer.

According to the Centre-run system of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research, measures against Covid-19 has led to a drop of PM 2.5 (fine particulate pollutants) by 40% in Jaipur, 30% in Jodhpur, 35% in Udaipur, 45% in Ajmer and 35% in Pali. “PM 2.5 checks the level of pollutants which are not visible, but dangerous for asthmatic patients suffering with various allergies,” said a senior doctor at SMS Hospital

AQI ranging from 0 to 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 (moderate), 101 to 150 (unhealthy for sensitive groups), 151 to 200 (unhealthy for all), 201 to 300 (very unhealthy) and (301 to 500) hazardous.
