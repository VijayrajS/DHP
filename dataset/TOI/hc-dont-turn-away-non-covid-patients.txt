Don’t turn away non-Covid patients: Telangana HC
2020-05-05
HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday directed the government to ask the doctors to not ignore non-Covid emergencies and also keep sufficient number of ambulances ready across the state to transport patients in dire need to the nearest hospitals. 

 


The direction came in the light of the death of a pregnant woman and her newborn child due to misinterpretation by authorities.

“Issue a circular to this effect immediately and let the ambulance phone numbers are made known to all the people so that they can call the ambulances in emergencies,” said a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy after converting a letter written by advocate K Kishore Kumar as a Public Interest Litigation. The bench sought a reply from government by May 20.

“You cannot deny medical aid to patients requiring it badly,” the bench told the state. The letter narrated how a young 20-year-old pregnant woman from Gadwal district was made to run to various hospitals in a 200-km radius to get urgent medical help. 

The doctors finally advised her husband to take her to Hyderabad where doctors at the government maternity hospital had refused treatment, on the grounds that since she came from a Covid-19 hotspot she should be subjected to novel coronavirus tests first. 

She was taken to Gandhi Hospital where her test results had come negative. The next day, she delivered a baby boy at the maternity hospital, both the mother and the child died within a few hours. Her husband held the state authorities squarely responsible for the deaths of his wife and son. 

The bench, while hearing another PIL by professor PL Vishweshwar Rao, sought to know whether there are any norms that mandate the state government to conduct Covid-19 tests on all bodies before cremating them regardless of the cause of deaths. The petitioner was seeking tests on all the dead persons.
