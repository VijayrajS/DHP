AURANGABAD: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad, received an indigeneously-prepared robot from a local industry for the convenience of medical staff in management of Covid-19. The device helps in delivering items to Covid-19 patients at their bedside.

The robot is donated to GMCH by Waluj-based Rucha Yantra. Being the only state-run tertiary care hospital in the district, a Dedicated Covid Hospital is established at the medicine building of GMCH. All Covid-19 patients with symptoms and those in critical condition are treated at the hospital. In such a situation, it becomes highly important that the team of doctors and medical staff serving at the facility stay healthy. 

According to GMCH dean Kanan Yelikar, the remote-operated device is significantly helpful during Covid-19 pandemic. “Our staff is able to use the robot for sanitising the isolation ward for Covid-19 patients and to deliver medicines and other items to the patients at their beds,” Yelikar said. 

The nurses wanting to administer doses of medicines or food to the patients can place the items on the tray of the device and move it as needed with the help of a remote without actually going near the patient.

Medical superintendent Suresh Harbade, deputy dean Kailash Zine and head of department of medicine have expressed gratitude towards Rucha Yantra for providing the device to the hospital free of cost.

The robot is developed by the team of Rucha Yantra lead by the founder Rohit Dashrathi specially keeping in mind the needs of hospital staff serving Covid-19 patients. “The team’s relentless efforts have made the robot capable of delivering medicines and food to Covid-19 patients. It also assists in sanitizing the hospital area. It also comes with a UV disinfectant accessory which is used for bacterial and viral disinfection purposes in healthcare units”, Dashrathi said.
