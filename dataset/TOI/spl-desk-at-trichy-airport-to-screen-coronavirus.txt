TRICHY: Following the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan of China, Trichy international airport authorities have set up a special screening test process at the airport for the international passengers, in a move to preempt the spread of the virus in the district. 

Though the airport has no direct connectivity with China, the authorities have decided to go ahead with the process, as passengers might have arrived here via Singapore, Dubai, Sharjah, Kuala Lumpur, from China, Airport health officer Dr Subin said.

“We established the screening desk on Tuesday. None of the international passenger have symptoms of coronavirus over the last two days. With the district health department, we began screening of passengers arriving by international flights,” he said.

Dr A Subramani, deputy director of health services, told ToI that passengers arrived here by overseas flights are screened to ascertain if they have any common flu symptoms such as high fever, runny nose and breathing trouble. If we can spot anyone with the symptoms, they would be rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Medical College Hospital in Chennai, he said.

“We have a team of doctors and paramedical staff at the airport who screen the passengers with the help of an infra-red gun. Airport authorities have promised us to get thermal screening equipment within a day. The airport authorities have provided space at the pre-immigration area to check passengers who stayed more than 14 days in China,” Dr Subramani said. 

“Airlines staffers have been directed to take passengers to the health desk before immigration check. An ambulance has been stationed at the airport to rush the passengers to MGMGH arriving with symptoms of coronavirus,” .

An isolation ward has been established at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College Hospital in Trichy with required medical staff.
