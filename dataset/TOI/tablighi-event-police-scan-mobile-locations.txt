2020-04-08
NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is scanning through the mobile phone locations of more than 2,000 people who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s programme in March. The persons who have now spread across the country will be tracked down and sent to the Covid-19 test centres for isolation. A Crime Branch team visited the venue, along with a forensic team, on Tuesday.


A probe revealed that on March 24, police had arranged for evacuation of more than 1,200 residents of Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid. Even on that day, about 2,000 more people had reached the headquarters in batches.

Police sources said that about 2,340 people were present at the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters when the lockdown was enforced. A number of people attended and left the premises before that. Cops suspect that they too might have carried strains of the virus. The technical data of mobile phones operating in the area for all the three days are being analysed to identify such people, sources added.

Even though the Markaz authorities maintained a log of the visitors, their addresses or mobile phone numbers were not verified. Some of the numbers were either registered with someone unrelated or found to be switched off.

When a team led by the area SDM and officials from the health department had visited the premises between March 26 and 30, they had found almost 1,300 people staying there. The Markaz officials claimed that they could not identify them and they were staying there at their own risk.
