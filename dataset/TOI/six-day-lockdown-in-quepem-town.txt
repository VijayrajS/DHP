2020-06-13
Quepem: The Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) on Friday held a meeting and decided to impose a six-day lockdown in Quepem town from Tuesday till next Sunday.

Councillor Amol Kanekar suggested that a lockdown be imposed in the town since two Covid positive cases have been reported in Assolda and Pirla, in Quepem taluka.

Dr Lorna Fernandes from the Quepem primary health centre said on Friday that the preliminary test of a lady from Ambaulim has come negative. Fernandes, said the woman, will remain at the isolation ward of the TB hospital in Margao till her second test report is received. Ambaulim is in QMCâ€™s jurisdiction.

Kanekar said that the council was unanimous in its decision for a lockdown, keeping in mind the safety of the people. The QMC has urged the public to stock essential commodities on Sunday and Monday.
