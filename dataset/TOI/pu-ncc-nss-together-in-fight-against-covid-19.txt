PATNA: Even as Patna University (PU) colleges are shut due to the 21-day lockdown, it is offering the services of its NCC cadets and NSS volunteers to prevent the spread of coronavirus and help the poor.

The university has submitted a list of NSS volunteers to the district administration and prepared another list of NCC cadets, who can provide emergency support. 

PU registrar Manoj Kumar Mishra told this newspaper that the e-mail ids and contact details of at least 100 NSS volunteers from each institution had been forwarded to the Union ministry of youth affairs.

“Such volunteers have been asked to download the ‘Aarogya Setu’ app on their cell phones so that they keep abreast of the latest initiatives of the health ministry for prevention of Covid-19. They will also be given kits for preparing face masks,” he said.

Staff to donate one-day salary to CM’s fund: All the officers, teachers and non-teaching staff of PU have decided to donate their one-day salary to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to fight against coronavirus.

The teachers and staff of Chanakya National Law University had donated a sum of Rs 3.38 lakh to the PM CARES Fund on Friday.
