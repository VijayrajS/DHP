Pune: A shave, followed by a face massage, at a salon during the lockdown has landed two police constables in a spot. 

The Pune rural police have transferred the two constables after they were caught red handed getting a shave inside the salon in Junnar. The video of the incident has gone viral on social media.

The Junnar police have registered an offence against the salon operator for functioning during the lockdown. Superintendent of police (Pune rural) Sandip Patil has initiated a departmental inquiry against the two.

Satish Dake, a member of the association of salons in Junnar, has lodged an FIR. The Junnar police said the salon was located in a commercial complex in Junnar. “As all the shops are closed, the operator used to allow the customers into his salon through a rear door,” a Junnar police officer from said.

On May 2, some members of the association received a tip-off that the salon operator was functioning clandestinely despite the restrictions. 

“The members went to the shop and found two policemen inside,” the officer said, adding, “They were found having a face massage after the shave.”

He said they approached the police and lodged an FIR. “The constables are from the state reserve police force and were posted in Junnar for bandobast duty,” the officer said. 

“The two constables have been transferred to Baramati and an inquiry has been initiated against them,” the officer added.
