2020-03-21
AGRA: Etah superintendent of police (SP) Sunil Kumar Singh on Friday called for stern action against those who refuse to cooperate with health officials' directives on containing Covid-19.


He also said strong action would be taken against those who spread false rumours about coronavirus.

“Take legal action against those who spread false rumours and refuse to follow the health department directives or cooperate in containing the virus. Such individuals must be booked under IPC sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).”

Stating out the guideline to protect themselves, the SP, in his briefing, also told the cops that it was mandatory to use hand sanitiser and mask while on duty. He also distributed sanitisers and masks to the policemen.

The SP also commissioned 19 rapid response teams (RRT) dedicated to distress calls related to Covid-19.

“The RRT’s primary job is to quickly take action on the distress call of Covid-19. Recently, there were inputs shared about Covid-19 infected patient fleeing hospital out of fear, therefore, if any such a situation arises, the RRT team will work to trace such persons and coordinate with the health department to contain the infection,” Singh added.
