Hurt by lockdown, lorry owners seek tax holiday from state govt
2020-04-15
Vijayawada: The extension of the lockdown comes as a severe blow to the cityâ€™s transport sector which is already reeling under various sectoral problems. As all the trucks other than carrying essential supplies have been stalled, lorry owners are finding it difficult to meet the ends. The lorry owners fear that their problems will compound with the extended lockdown.

The city which has been known for its transport business has more than 10 per cent of the total trucks in the state. Most of these trucks are into inter-state operations transporting various goods. With the lockdown announced by the Union government to contain the spread of Covid-19, a majority of these trucks are stuck somewhere on the highways, said Y V Eswar Rao, general secretary, Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners Association (APLOA).

Eswar Rao said the disruption caused in the supply chain network has hit them hard. The majority of the small players are now facing the threat of defaulting their term loans. Though Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given a moratorium of three months, it is of no help as the accrued interest will be added to the principal and loan burden will get compounded.

More than paying back the loans, the lorry owners are facing immediate problems like paying salaries, renew permit licences and pay quarterly taxes. Eswar Rao said that they have requested the state government to give a tax holiday for at least two quarters from now so as to come out of this unprecedented problem.

The lorry owners are now pinning their hopes on the relaxations that the central government likely to announce in the areas where virus spread is not there after April 20.
