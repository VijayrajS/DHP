DEHRADUN: A day after the Haryana government informed Uttarakhand officials that a woman who stayed in a Dehradun-based luxury hotel has been tested Covid-19 positive, the district administration is now finding out about the people who came in contact with the woman during her three-day stay in the capital city. Besides, the staff of the hotel where she is stayed are being quarantined and the hotel has been sanitised.


According to officials of the district administration, the woman and her husband who hail from Faridabad had travelled to Spain and returned to India in the first week of March. They had stayed in the Doon hotel from March 9 to March 11.

“We have asked the hotel staff who attended to the woman to remain in 14-day quarantine and the hotel has been locked down for the public. The facility has also been sanitised,” said Dehradun’s district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava.

The administration has also sought the travel data of the couple and the information regarding persons they met and where did they go. These efforts are being made to trace people who came in contact with the woman so that any chances of community transmission are contained.

“This case is almost like that of singer Kanika Kapoor who went to various places after coming from abroad and did not stay in quarantine. We are getting details of the Faridabad woman as well. If it is found that this woman, too, went around while acknowledging that she is not well, action will be taken against her,” said a health department official.
