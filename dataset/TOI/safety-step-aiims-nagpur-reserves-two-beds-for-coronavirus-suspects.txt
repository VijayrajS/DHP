2020-02-01
Nagpur: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Nagpur has reserved two beds in case any coronavirus suspects approach the hospital. AIIMS also released the Dos and Don’ts for coronavirus. 

“AIIMS has initially reserved two beds with all isolation facilities in case we get any suspect of this viral infection. But we have the entire set-up ready to tackle any situation in the future,” said AIIMS Director and CEO Major Gen (Dr) Vibha Dutta, adding that vigilance is the key to tackle this infection.

“Public health measures, including quarantining in the community, timely diagnosis, and strict adherence to universal precautions in health care settings are important for prevention of the viral infection. As vaccines or anti-viral drugs are not available on this virus, it can be treated symptomatically,” she added.

Dr Dutta claimed that the outpatient department (OPD) of AIIMS has been receiving a good response with the average footfall of 400 to 500 patients per day. “The construction of the 300-bedded In-Patient Department (IPD) is on in full swing and we are planning to complete it by the end of this year. It will have 24 modular operation theatres (OTs), ICUs, imaging facilities like MRI, CT Scan, and Linear accelerators,” she said. 

In academics, AIIMS will start PG courses in pre-clinical and para clinical subjects by mid 2020 and MD/MS courses by 2021.

Second foundation day of AIIMS on Feb 2

AIIMS, Nagpur, will celebrate its second foundation day on February 2 at its Mihan campus from 9.30am. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari will be the chief guest. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, AIIMS president professor PK Dave, secretary of ministry of health and family welfare (Govt of India) Preeti Sudan and secretary of medical education and drugs (Govt of Maharashtra) Dr Sanjay Mukherjee will address the faculty, staff and students.

IGGMC is now nodal VRDL 

Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) has received the status of nodal Viral Research and Diagnostic Lab (VRDL) for Nagpur.
