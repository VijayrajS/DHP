BENGALURU: The Karnataka government has provided 630 beds in the isolation wards of its hospitals to exclusively deal with suspected coronavirus cases. Besides, 1,689 beds have been reserved in private hospitals, said health minister B Sriramulu.


Addressing media on the state’s preparedness in the wake of Covid-19 scare on Tuesday, the minister said all measures are in place to tackle the situation.


Screening of international passengers coming from Covid-19-hit counties began at Kempegowda International Airport on January 20. Since then, 40,207 people have undergone thermal screening. Among them, 560 travellers (from virus-affected nations) have been identified and 352 of them are under home isolation. Of them, 179 patients have completed 28 days of observation. So far, 251 samples of suspected cases have tested negative. Karnataka hasn’t seen a single positive case yet. The results of 13 samples are yet to be known.

At Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, three patents are in the isolation ward. Stating that there is no medicine for Covid-19, the minister said the public must be cautious of anyone who claims to have home remedies and alternative therapy. “The health department hasn’t endorsed any medicine. Hygiene factors have to maintained as per the guidelines issued,” he said.

“In Karnataka, the samples are being tested in two laboratories in Bengaluru — National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru branch and the virus research and diagnostic laboratory on Victoria Hospital campus and it takes just over four hours to get the results,” said medical education minister K Sudhakar.
