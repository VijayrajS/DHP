JAIPUR: The rooms of the luxury hotels where the Italian tourists stayed in Bikaner, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaipur, have been sealed. The action has been taken after two people, from a 23-member Italian group, tested positive for Covid-19.


The group had travelled through major tourist places in Rajasthan and reached Jaipur on February 28. They were tested positive for Covid-19 on March 3 and 4.

Apprehensive of possible transmission of the disease, health authorities have denied entry of any hotel staff or guests in these rooms since they could become source of Covid-19 infection.

To disinfect these rooms, health authorities are using 1% sodium hypochlorite for mopping all hard surfaces such as handles, chairs, tables, etc.

“We disinfected 13 rooms in the hotel, where the Italian group stayed. After that we sealed the rooms for at least 14 days to ward off risk of transmission of the disease to other people staying in the same room,” said Dr Dinesh Kharadi, CMHO, Udaipur.

The tourists spent one day (February 22) in Bikaner, two days (February 23-24) in Jaisalmer, one day (February 25) in Jodhpur, and three days (February 26-28) in Udaipur before leaving for Jaipur.

In Jaipur, the health department sealed 16 rooms, in Jodhpur the entire floor, while 13 rooms were sealed in Bikaner after they were disinfected. “We are taking all possible measures to check the spread of Covid-19,” said Dr BL Meena, CMHO, Bikaner, while adding that they have kept 143 people in home isolation for 28 days, who came in contact with the Italian tourists.

Moreover, the health authorities have started door-to-door survey in the periphery of three kilometres of the hotels. They are constantly monitoring the health of those who came in contact with the Italian couple. So far, no person among contacts has been tested positive for Covid-19, the health authorities claimed.
