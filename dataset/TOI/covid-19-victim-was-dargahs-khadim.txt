‘Covid-19 victim was dargah’s khadim’
2020-04-20
Nagpur: Even as Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is working to trace the source of infection among Satranjipura residents, a close associate of city’s first Covid-19 deceased told TOI that his late friend would spend most of his time at the dargah inside the Badi Masjid.

“Many people from different places, and even outside the city, visit the tomb of Baba Baghdadi inside the masjid. He (Covid-19 victim) was khadim of the dargah in the absence of his brother. As he was financially weak, he would quietly seek charity from Baba’s followers coming daily at the dargah,” said the associate, who worked as property broker with him.

NMC had also picked up some office bearers of the masjid but they tested negative.

NMC containment team members said they didn’t pursue the dargah trail as the Badi Masjid was already shut after announcement of nationwide lockdown and not many people could have visited it.

So far, NMC has recorded that the deceased never travelled outside. “But people with travel history came in his contact at least till April 24,” the man said.
