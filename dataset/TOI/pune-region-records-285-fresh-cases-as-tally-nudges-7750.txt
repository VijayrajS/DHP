2020-06-01
PUNE: As many as 285 people in the Pune Metropolitan Region tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the toll for the region to 7,750.


In Pune Municipal Corporation limits, 267 people were found infected, taking the total case count to 6,537. 

On Sunday, 138 patients were declared cured and discharged, while six people lost their lives. 

All the deceased patients had underlying conditions and were suffering from issues like respiratory trouble, high blood pressure and diabetes. “The number of discharged patients stands at 3,782, after 138 were allowed to go home after recovery on Sunday, “ said a senior official from Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department. 

This takes the total death toll for the region to 337 — including 298 in Pune, 19 in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s jurisdiction and 20 in the rural parts of the region. 

The six deceased included three women, all of them from the Peth areas or densely populated areas. They included a 65-year-old woman from Laxminagar in Yerawada, and two 80-year-old women from Yashwantnagar, Yerawada, and More Vidyalay area in Kothrud. A 76-year-old resident of Nana Peth, a 52-year-old man from Tadiwala Road and a 63-year-old Kasba Peth resident too breathed their last. 

According to the district administration, nine fresh cases were found in PCMC limits, taking the total to 521. The civil surgeon and cantonment board limits have 408 cases, while the district heath office of the zilla parishad has recorded 284 cases.

TOI recently reported that the doubling rate in Pune civic limits had gone up from 6 days in March to 14 days currently. Doubling rate refers to the number of days it takes for the number of cases to double. 

Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad had said it was a good sign, but a closer reading of the PMC data showed that while the doubling rate increased, the average number of daily cases too had gone up. Civic officials, however, attributed this increase to a rise in the number of daily tests being done.
