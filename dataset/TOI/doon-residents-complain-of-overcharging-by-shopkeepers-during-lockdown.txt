Dehradun residents complain of overcharging by shopkeepers during lockdown
2020-03-25
DEHRADUN: With shops selling essential items open for only three hours — 7 am to 10 am — on Tuesday, several people were seen queuing up at the shops since early morning.


Many complained that quite a few vendors had almost doubled the prices of fruits and vegetables and some shopkeepers were also charging above the MRP (maximum retail price) for groceries citing low supplies as an excuse.

Ujjawal Rawat, a resident of Karanpur who went to the vegetable market near DAV College, said ,“Potato was being sold at Rs 25 per kg till Saturday night but now it costs Rs 35 per kg. Similarly, oranges are being sold at Rs 100 per kg as against their earlier price of Rs 45-Rs 50. The price of grapes has also shot up from Rs 80 to Rs 120.” Rawat added that many vendors were putting a cap on the quantity of a commodity a purchaser can buy.

Another local resident Anita Singh, who went to a grocery shop at EC Road, said that there was no milk and bread there at 8 pm and the shopkeepers were not ready to give more than 2 kilograms of a commodity to anyone.

Concerned with hordes of people outside grocery and vegetable/fruit shops, doctors and social activists questioned government’s idea of keeping a time cap on shops to remain open.

Dr Pahel M Soibam from AIIMS Rishikesh told TOI that keeping a time cap would cause more crowding and panic. “It would be better if shops remain open entire day but only one person form a family is allowed to venture out,” he said.
