Hyderabad: A Telangana high court advocate has lodged a complaint with police against social media sites and several users for allegedly communalising Covid-19 in violation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The WHO, in its guidelines on Covid-19 issued on March 18, has made it clear that the disease should not be attached to any particular ethnicity or nationality.

Khaja Aijazuddin on Thursday lodged the complaint with the cybercrime police and the Union ministry of home affairs against the social media sites for linking Covid-19 to a community and tweeting with hashtags ‘CoronaJehad’ and ‘BioTerrorism.’ Aijazuddin told TOI that he had sent copies of the complaint to Telangana DGP and Hyderabad police commissioner. He said social media sites had allowed messages demonising a religious group and describing them as terrorists.

“When referring to people with Covid-19, do not attach the disease to any particular ethnicity or nationality,” he said, quoting WHO guidelines.

He said the social media sites did not block the users despite abusive posts. “This is also against the Constitution. The messages and photos allowed by these sites are against the secular fabric of India. Such trends may result in disturbance of the communal harmony,” Aijazuddin said in his complaint.

He urged MHA and Telangana police to intervene and issue directions to the social media sites to not allow messages and photographs against any social, ethnic or religious group. He said such communal posts could lead to mutual mistrust and enmity among different sections of society.
