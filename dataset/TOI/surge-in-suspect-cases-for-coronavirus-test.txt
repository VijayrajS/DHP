2020-03-12
PATNA: A Samastipur native was kept in the isolation ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Wednesday after he developed symptoms of coronavirus. He had returned from Dubai recently.


PMCH superintendent Dr Bimal Kumar Karak said the man was referred by Samastipur Sadar hospital and his blood samples will be sent for test. This is the second case of isolation in PMCH. Earlier, a Chhapra native was kept in the PMCH isolation ward. She had returned from China and was relieved after her sample tested negative. 

PMCH principal Dr VP Chaudhary said another Aurangabad native was advised home isolation.

During Holi, the state has witnessed increased number of cases enrolled for observation as they had come from coronavirus-infected areas. Till March 9, total 128 people were put under observation, but the figures surged to 144 on March 10. Before March 8, either one or two new suspect cases were seen each day.

State nodal officer for coronavirus Dr Ragini Mishra said, “This increase in number is because people are returning from countries infected by coronavirus to their native places. In coming days, we may expect more number of such cases.”

Dr Mishra further said the health department has involved its 104 toll-free number from Wednesday to track people coming from outside Bihar. “With 20 lines, it was earlier being used to solve general queries. But now this will be actively involved to track passengers,” she said.

The state government has called a coordination committee meeting on Thursday to monitor the situation and plan strategy for future action. As per the press release shared by state health society, total 52 samples have been collected for the test. So far, no positive case has been recorded in Bihar.
