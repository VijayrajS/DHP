TIRUPATI: The spike in Covid-19 cases in Kurnool district continues. With 25 new cases reported on Monday, the district’s tally is now 491, just nine cases short of the 500-mark. The 491 positive tally includes 10 deaths, 115 recoveries including 29 on Monday, and 366 active cases who are undergoing treatment in various hospitals in the district.

Of the 29 discharged patients, there are 25 men and four women. “Eleven of them are aged between 50 to 70 years. Others are aged between 15 to 50 years. While 22 of the 29 patients are from Kurnool city, two each are from Nandyal and Atmakur regions. One patient each among the discharged are from Kodumur and Krishnagiri in the district. One Telangana patient who was admitted to the Covid-19 hospital here and recovered fully has also been discharged,” district collector G Veerapandian said.

He further said that 11,810 community quarantines have been set up across the district to tackle the migrant workers who are expected to return in the coming days.

“We have so far collected 14,606 samples for screening, out of which 491 samples tested positive, 13,916 suspects tested negative, while the results of 199 samples are awaited. About 3.600 suspects housed at various state quarantine facilities tested negative too and were discharged recently,” he said.

Out of the 42,000 people from the district who were stranded in various places in Guntur and Prakasam districts, about 38,000 have returned to their homes. “Random sampling of the returnees have been done. All migrant labourers who returned back to the district have been placed under mandatory home quarantine period of 14 days,” the collector added.

Allaying fears among the people as well as frontline workers, Veerapandian said more positive cases are being reported because the district administration has ramped up the overall number of sampling. “More medical staff have also been appointed by the government. Our appeal to the people of the district is to strictly remain indoors and adhere to the lockdown guidelines to prevent the outbreak of the novel virus’‘, he said.

Meanwhile, district SP Kaginelli Fakeerappa said strict vigil is being maintained at inter-state checkposts. “Cases have been slapped against 3,930 persons under different sections of the IPC for lockdown violation,” he said.
