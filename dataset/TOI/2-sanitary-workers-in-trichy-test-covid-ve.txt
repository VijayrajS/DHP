TRICHY: After a bill collector with the Trichy Corporation tested positive for Covid-19, two permanent sanitary workers with the urban local body tested positive on Saturday. A 44-year-old female sanitary worker residing near East Boulevard in Ariyamangalam zone and a 52-year-old male sanitary worker residing at Moolathoppu in Srirangam zone have contracted the virus. Both the sanitary workers had no travel history and were only commuting between their houses and their work locations in Trichy.

The duo attached to the Srirangam zone of the corporation were involved in street sweeping activities. On June 10, the corporation had conducted a mass screening for nearly 150 sanitary workers in the zone in which the two sanitary workers were found positive. Both the sanitary workers were asymptomatic, the health officials added. 

“Both the sanitary workers did not travel outside the city and were involved in cleaning activities in their assigned wards. They did not work in any of the containment zones,” a corporation official added. They workers were not involved in door-to-door waste collection as well, eliminating the possibility of them contracting the virus from visiting houses of Covid-19 positive patients. A disinfection drive was carried out at Moolathoppu (ward number 1) and EB road (ward number 15) on Saturday. 

The female sanitary worker is said to have frequented a spot near her house where inter-state trucks were parked. The male sanitary worker was employed in cleaning activities at a place within 5-km radius of his house. Sources said that the two sanitary workers did not belong to the same team. 

Officials are tracing the civic body employees who came in contact with two workers.
