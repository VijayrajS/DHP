HYDERABAD: Chenchu tribal women in the Srisailam forest area have started sewing cloth masks. The cloth is provided to them free of cost by the Rural Development Trust (RDT), the forest department and others. 


“The masks will be distributed to Covid-19 frontline workers, govt employees and vulnerable groups,” explained Aina Valldaura, communications manager of RDT. Each Chenchu woman makes 50 masks a day. “Once it is ensured that each person of the Chenchu community has at least three masks, the remaining will be bought at Rs 6 per piece,” Valldaura said.
