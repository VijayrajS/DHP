SURAT: A newly-wed couple, who returned from their honeymoon in Malaysia and Singapore, has been kept under observation at Bharuch Civil Hospital after they complained of cough and cold as a preventive measure against coronavirus on Thursday. 


Dr SR Patel, resident medical officer (RMO), said, “The couple had gone on honeymoon to Malaysia and Singapore and returned to Bharuch two days ago. The couple came to the civil hospital with cough and cold symptoms and were immediately kept under observation in the isolation ward. We collected their samples and sent them to BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad for testing.” 

The couple is the first to be kept under observation by the authorities after the isolation ward was set up at the civil hospital. 

Dr Patel said, “Following government directive, the civil hospital and district administration have issued an advisory in the district for those who returned from foreign travel to any of the destinations grappling with coronavirus. Bharuch and Ankleshwar have a sizeable number of people working abroad.”
