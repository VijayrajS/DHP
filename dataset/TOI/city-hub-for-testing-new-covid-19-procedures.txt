AHMEDABAD: Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad has started drug trials of remdesivir, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine and interferon for the treatment of Covid-19. State health department officials said that the stock of the drugs has arrived as part of WHO’s Solidarity Trial and the patients have also been identified for the purpose.

 

A city-based expert said the world has now been living with the virus for over six months and treatment protocols are changing globally, based on results and reactions to various drugs which are being repurposed to fight Covid-19.

As on Thursday, Gujarat had recorded 586 deaths including 465 from Ahmedabad district alone.

Several city-based pharma firms are also at forefront of identifying possible cures for the infection.
