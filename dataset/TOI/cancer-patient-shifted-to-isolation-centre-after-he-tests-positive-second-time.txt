2020-05-02
AGRA: A 63-year-old cancer patient from Hathras, who tested positive for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Noida two days ago, was shifted to Aligarh’s JNMC from his residence on Friday only after he again tested positive by local health officials. With this, the total tally of such cases rose to five in Hathras district.


Talking to TOI, Hathras CMO Brijesh Rathore said the patient's family members approached them on Wednesday for a Covid test, as he had visited a Noida hospital for chemotherapy but his relatives did not inform that he had already tested positive there. 

“We have admitted the patient in the isolation ward of JNMC after receiving his report,” said Rathore. 

However, the family members claimed that they had informed the health officials about his Covid positive report on April 28. They shifted him only after receiving their own report on Friday.

Now, all 25 members of his family who live in the same house have been placed under quarantine.

District magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar said one kilometre radius of the house where the family lives has been sealed completely and only essential items will be home delivered in the area. He said thermal screening will be conducted door to door by health workers in the area. 

Last month, the state government had declared Hathras district free of coronavirus after patients suffering from the virus fully recovered and no new patient was infected with the virus in the district.
