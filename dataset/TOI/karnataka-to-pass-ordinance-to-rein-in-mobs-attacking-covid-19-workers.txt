Karnataka to pass ordinance to rein in mobs attacking Covid-19 workers
2020-04-21
BENGALURU: The state government is set to promulgate an ordinance, based on the Uttar Pradesh and Kerala model, to protect police and frontline health workers fighting Covid-19. It is also aimed at punishing those indulging in spreading fake news and those who do not cooperate with the government in containing the pandemic.

The state cabinet, which met here on Monday, decided to promulgate Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Ordinance mainly aimed at reining in those who are attacking frontline staff fighting the pandemic. The move comes in the wake of increasing attacks on Asha workers, doctors and civic workers, including the latest incident at Padarayanapura on Sunday night.

Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said the nature and quantum of punishment for infiltrators of violence and attacks will be spelt out in detail in the ordinance.

The Kerala ordinance prescribes imprisonment for a term extending to two years or a fine up to Rs 10,000 for both who violate restrictions and also those who instigate the same. The UP ordinance also seeks to recover losses caused to public property from perpetrators of violence and attacks, besides imprisonment.

The state government has been under pressure to act tough against people attacking Covid-19 warriors ever since the first incident at Sadiq Nagar, where an Asha worker was allegedly heckled by a group of over 50 people while she was conducting a health survey in the area. During that time, home minister Basavaraj Bommai came under attack for being lenient. Chief minister BS Yediyuappa too had dismissed it as a trivial incident. The government was under pressure to act after the second attack at Padarayanapura, a containment zone which has reported the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases in Bengaluru city.
