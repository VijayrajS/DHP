2020-04-28
Nagpur: Hotel industry is looking at a sea change in the way it operates post lockdown, felt experts who participated in a webinar organized by Tuli College of Hotel Management. They all agreed that though the current time is tough, both the overall economy and hospitality sector will bounce back within a year.Manoj Bali, general manager of Radisson Blu, said “The Indian economy will grow by 7.4% by early next year. The economy should start picking up by November and for hotels, we may see more of corporate business. Quality of work and services are going to improve and that will only bring value to the industry.”Arjun Singh Arora, director of Centre Point Hotel, expects business to pick up after Diwali. Arora said, “Obviously, nothing can be said for certain till travel restrictions are removed, but we can expect things to get back to normal post festive (Diwali) season.”Sudhir Andrews, former principal of the prestigious Indian Institute of Hotel Management (Delhi), sees reduced human contact. “Soft opening of hotels will be there with fewer people and simple menus and self-service. Robot cleaning machines, digital payments and liquor options only through mini-bar are some ways where human contact will be reduced,” said Andrews.Suresh Mathur, COO for Auro Hotels India, said guests will need to be aware of sanitization practices. “Hotels will need to have literature of how everything is sanitised in the hotel to make the guest aware of safety measures. We have to look at providing breakfast in rooms and also focus will be on sanitizing rooms by identifying touch-prone areas.”Urvashi Yashroy, director of the Tuli college who moderated the webinar, said, “Students must learn as many skills as possible during this quarantine time. These skills will not only help you gain confidence but also give you a great understanding of the industry.”
