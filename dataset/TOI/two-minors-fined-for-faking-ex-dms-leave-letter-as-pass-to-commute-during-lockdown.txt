2020-04-07
Meerut: Two minors were fined and their motorcycle was impounded after the duo allegedly used a leave application letter of Noida's former DM BN Singh, in a bid to hoodwink the cops into believing that it was some kind of ‘authorisation letter’ to travel during the lockdown. The incident occurred near Raiwala Crossing when the two minors tried to pass through a barricade.“From a distance, the letter appeared like a pass with appropriate signatures, but the format looked a bit different from the regular permits issued to essential services-designated vehicles. A closer look unearthed their mischief,” said Mandi police station in-charge, Adesh Tyagi.“The bike they were riding in has been seized and they have been challaned under Indian Motor Vehicles Act Sec 207 (detention of vehicle without registration or permit) and 3 (181) (one-month imprisonment and fine),” he added.SSP, Saharanpur, Dinesh Kumar P said, “The two minors have been let off, but their parents will have to face the consequences for this violation.”
