2020-03-19
UDHAGAMANDALAM: Hoteliers, restaurant owners, taxi operators and small-time vendors are feeling the pinch with tourist inflow to the town dwindling due to the coronavirus. 


But the locals are happy to see a tourist-free Ooty like in 80s and 90s. 

All the tourist locations look deserted and hotels remain with zero occupancy in the town. Locals were seen playing badminton on the Garden Road.

“All together, it is a different Ooty now without the presence of tourists. I am going back to the 80s and 90s of Ooty,” Saravanakumar, a local resident, said. He added, “Those days’ tourists come only during the summer season. Nowadays, it is tourist season throughout the year.”

“Roads are free and no congestion on footpaths. We the locals are enjoying the real beauty of Ooty,” Hariharan said. 

“At the same time, we also keep in mind about the precautionary measures to be followed against coronavirus,” he added.

Secretary of Nilgiris Hoteliers’ Association N Chandrasekar said, “All the hotels in the district are closed. We made sure that by noon today in-house guests are checked out.” He said, “Of course, the economy of the district is in doldrums. But we need to support the government.”

The municipal officials conducted regular checks in hotels for zero occupancy. 

However, locals feel that officials should monitor road-side eateries as well on their hygiene.
