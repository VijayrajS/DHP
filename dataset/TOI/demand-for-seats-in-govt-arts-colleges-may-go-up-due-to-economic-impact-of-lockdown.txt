Trichy: The economic impact of Covid-19 lockdown is expected to last long, especially on the lower income groups, and this may reflect in admissions to higher educational institutions.The demand for seats in government arts colleges are expected to increase this year as families may not be able to afford seats in private colleges after being hit economically by Covid-19 lockdown. N Rajan, 45, a construction labourer from Kumbakonam, wanted his son to be admitted in a popular government-aided college in Trichy this year. But, he has now decided to get him admitted to a government arts college in Kumbakonam.He said that he may not be able to afford hostel expense and fee of the self-financing course that his son wants to pursue. “While majority people have been economically affected due to Covid-19 lockdown, we can certainly expect an increase in demand for seats in government arts colleges,” said G Ramesh, state vice president of Tamil Nadu government college teachers association (TNGCTA).A student, who pays Rs 1,000 as fee in government colleges, takes back Rs 3,000 in the form of scholarship every year, said principal of a government arts college in Trichy. There are plans to start 10 new government arts colleges in the state in coming months and there will be increase of 20% seats in existing colleges, which will help in meeting the increasing demand, said the principal.However, former vice chancellor of a state-run university said that off late, priority is given to quality of education and parents may not hesitate to go an extra mile spending for quality education of their wards.“There is no doubt that the government colleges have quality faculty members, who are well paid. If only the teachers were a little more committed, government colleges would be far ahead of private colleges," said the former VC.Many private arts and science colleges have been efficiently handling the lockdown by engaging students through online classes. However, same is not the case with government colleges, added the former VC.
