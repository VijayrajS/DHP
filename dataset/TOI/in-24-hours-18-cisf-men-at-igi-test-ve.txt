NEW DELHI: In the past 24 hours, 18 CISF personnel have tested Covid-19 positive at IGI Airport taking the total to 25, a bulletin issued by CISF on Tuesday said. The news comes a day after resumption of domestic flight operations.


All 18 personnel were asymptomatic and had been moved to a quarantine facility last week. Their test results arrived on Monday. They were contacts of the seven personnel who had tested positive earlier, an official said.

Hemendra Kumar, PRO and AIG, CISF, said the 18 personnel were in quarantine well before their test results arrived. “They were identified through contact tracing and separated before the airport operations resumed on Monday. All personnel currently deployed are healthy and staying in a different facility,” he added.

CISF has begun contactless frisking at the airport, using barcode scanners to check tickets and metal detectors to scan passengers. A glass partition has also been installed outside through which CISF personnel check passenger IDs and tickets, the official said.

“We have been actively testing our personnel and ensuring even the asymptomatic cases are detected early. No one else has been placed under quarantine other than these 18 personnel,” said Kumar.

Apart from IGI, Delhi Metro is yet another area most prone to Covid-19 infection. Currently, 22 CISF personnel working with DMRC have tested Covid-19 positive, while another official has recovered in the past 24 hours.
