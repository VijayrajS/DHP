Bareilly: A 35-year-old migrant worker, who died in UP's Shahjahanpur while on way back to Bihar from Delhi on his bicycle, was tested negative for Covid-19. He died due to "lung infection".Dharamveer was a resident of Khairaat village of Khagaria district in Bihar and used to live in Shakurbasti area in Delhi. The district administration was planning to send his body to Bihar, but his family decided to come to Shahjahanpur instead.He was part of a seven-member group which took off from Delhi on Tuesday morning on their bicycles after they feared that the lockdown would be extended again. The group decided to take rest near an under construction toll plaza in Shahjahanpur when it suddenly started to rain on Thursday night. On Friday morning, Dharamveer complained of chest pain and died before receiving any medical attention. Health department has kept the other members of his group under institutional quarantine in Shahjahanpur.Dr Sandesh Gupta, a member of autopsy team, told TOI, “Infection in the lungs was the cause of death. The infection may be due to tuberculosis.” While CMO Rajeev Gupta said, “Dharamveer was tested negative for Covid-19 but we still kept the other members of his group under institutional quarantine. His family has contacted us and said they are on their way to Shahjahanpur. So, we have kept the body at a mortuary after autopsy.”
