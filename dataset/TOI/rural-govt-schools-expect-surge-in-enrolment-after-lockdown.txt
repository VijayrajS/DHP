2020-05-03
TRICHY: Even as there is no official announcement about the reopening of schools in the state, rural government schools are in an upbeat mood as they anticipate a significant surge in enrolment. Teachers anticipate at least 10% surge in new admissions. 


With a majority of parents in underdeveloped Ariyalur and Perambalur districts employed as daily wagers in Chennai and other cities, the ongoing lockdown has crippled their earnings. 

Teachers say that parents of children studying in private schools may find it difficult to pay the fees and opt to enrol their wards in government schools.

The panchayat union middle schools (PUMS) in Ariyalaur and Perambalur are eager to augment their strength. “Post the lockdown, we expect our school’s enrolment to surge by at least 10%. We will promote our school to attract new admissions,” K Thirumalaiselvi, headmaster, Kallakudi PUMS, Ariyalur said. 

Schools are planning to exhibit benefits such as freebies, a student will get by joining a government school. Such proactive measures earlier have helped increase the strength of government schools in Ariyalur district from 1.36 lakh students in 2018 academic year to 1.40 lakh students in 2019. The number is expected to grow further.

“The demand for government schools will certainly increase based on the quality too,” S Elavalagan, a teacher from Kothavasal PUMS, Perambalur district said.

Experts believe that economic reason alone will not be the factor. “Infrastructure development made in government schools will play a role,” said educationist Prince Gajendra Babu.
