Ahmedabad: Interns threaten to boycott Covid-19 duty at civil hospital

AHMEDABAD: Students of BJ Medical College (BJMC) who are posted at the Asarwa Civil hospital took to social media on Thursday to air their grievances against the authorities. They have threatened to boycott Covid-19 duty until their demands are met. 


The BJMC interns have demanded that all interns from colleges that do not have Covid-19 wards, should be posted at the 1,200-bed Covid-19 facility at Civil Hospital. This will ease the burden on BJMC interns who have been posted on emergency duty at the Covid-19 facility. 

Through a social media group called BJMC Interns, they have alleged that due to the absence of many senior doctors, the interns are overburdened and overexposed. They want that all interns serve for a period of seven days that would be followed by a proper quarantine. Only once this is done should they be expected to resume non-Covid duties. The number of interns posted at a time should also be decreased, they said. 

“The work distribution amongst health workers should be justified. Procedures needing skill should be the responsibility of qualified doctors. Interns are only trainee doctors and should work only as assistants in all procedures,” the group said in their social media posts. 

In a separate development, an intern posted at the 1,200 bed Covid-19 centre alleged that she and her colleague were ill-treated by a resident doctor through a post on Facebook.
