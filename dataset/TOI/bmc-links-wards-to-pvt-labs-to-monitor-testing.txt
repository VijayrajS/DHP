BMC links wards to pvt labs to monitor testing
2020-05-05
Mumbai: BMC has linked civic wards to designated private laboratories to streamline and monitor testing. Civic official said it was done to curb “unnecessary” testing being carried out at private laboratories even if the individual was not exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the decision to link wards with private laboratories was finalised on Monday. “One ward should refer samples only to one laboratory for testing. We have iterated too that testing can be done with valid prescriptions from medical practitioners, health officials of the ward, medical superintendents, Covid Care Centres 2 (assigned for asymptomatic positive patients), and designated Covid hospitals,” he said. Each laboratory has been linked to three to four civic wards, he said. The city has 18 labs carrying out tests, of which about a dozen are private.

 A civic source said the idea behind linking of wards and private labs was to cut down unnecessary testing and streamline testing of samples at quarantine centres. “We have seen instances where private physicians are writing prescriptions, and people who can afford it are getting tests done even though not required. That is leading to overburdening of labs and delay in testing of real suspects,” said a ward officer. He added that the labs would have to attach the doctor’s prescription asking for the test along with the report. 

The tests here are nearing 65,000. Another civic official said previously, BMC’s central team had to be informed about tests, and it would collect samples. “If they were overburdened, some time would be lost in collecting samples. This will now mean decentralisation,” the official said.
