Gurgaon: Seven more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Nuh (Mewat) on Thursday, taking the total number of cases in the district to 55.

Out of these, 53 are active cases as two patients have been discharged.

Three of the seven new patients had attended the Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month. They belong to Nuh. Two others were in the chain of contact of the Jamaat members and are from Akhnaka village. Two more who tested positive had recently been to Latur in Maharashtra and hail from Jakh village, said a government official.

The district administration said out of 55 cases in Nuh, 42 are people who had attended the Tabighi Jamaat and another three are in their chain of contact. Ten others are locals, mostly truck drivers and their contacts.

While 20 patients are locals, 26 belong to other states. Nine others are foreign nationals. The health department and the district administration are tracking the Jamaat members’ contacts and all those who have been in touch with Covid-19 patients.

“We have put 1,923 people under active surveillance, out of which 268 have successfully completed the quarantine period,” the official said, adding that about 339 people have been in touch with patients.

Meanwhile, officials said nearly 100 samples were being sent from Nuh to PGI Rohtak for testing on a daily basis. The results of 91 people are expected on Friday.

The two patients who have recovered include a 22-year-old man from Kerala, Mohammad, and a man from Jammu and Kashmir, Nashir. They are currently in the government isolation facility at the Polytechnic College in Malab.
