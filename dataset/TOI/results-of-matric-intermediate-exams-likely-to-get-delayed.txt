PATNA: The results of Matriculation and Intermediate exams conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) are likely to be delayed as the evaluation work has been suspended till March 31 in view of the Covid-19 lockdown.


In a press note issued on Sunday evening, BSEB chairman Anand Kishor said, “As a precautionary measure, the evaluation work has been suspended. The regional offices will also remain closed till March 31.”

However, the closure of nine regional offices was revoked on Monday as “other works have to be carried out by the staff for finalizing the Intermediate results”.

Kishor told this newspaper on Monday that evaluation of the answer copies of Inter students was almost complete. 

“In the next couple of days, we will decide the date of declaration of Intermediate results. As far as the evaluation of Matriculation papers is concerned, almost 75% of them have been evaluated,” he said and added that the BSEB would try to complete the evaluation process before time.
