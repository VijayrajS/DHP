Providing details of the government decision, urban development minister and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said, “The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 of the Centre has authorised the state governments to take preventive measures to control any disease. Following this, the state has framed rules under the Uttarakhand Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation 2020.”

The state will also have the right to prevent any gathering for any purpose.” 

The minister added that “a fund corpus of Rs 50 crore has been earmarked for creating isolation wards, ICU preparation, equipment, medicines etc.” “The recruitment of additional nursing staff will also be made by the health department and a prefabricated 100-bed hospital will be built in case Covid-19 intensifies. Around 140 ambulances have been placed on alert to deal with emergencies. A helpline number ‘104’ has also been started,” Kaushik said.
