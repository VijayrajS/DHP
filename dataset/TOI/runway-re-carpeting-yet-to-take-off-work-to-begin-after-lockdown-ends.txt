Runway re-carpeting yet to take off, work to begin after lockdown ends
2020-04-26
BHUBANESWAR: The re-carpeting of the runway at Biju Patnaik International Airport, which was to begin in March, has not even started. Although equipment needed for the work had been set up, the sudden lockdown threw the airport’s plans into disarray.

The Rs 28-crore project has been approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. It will be carried out in two phases. Earlier, the airport had announced suspension of runway operations for a certain number of hours to facilitate the work.

Airport director V V Rao said the recarpeting would have begun in March. “We mobilised material, machine and manpower. Everything is parked inside the airport and is secure. Once the lockdown is lifted, the people who will carry out the work will be able to come into the city,” the director told TOI.

Airport runways have to be repaired every 10 years. “The last time the city airport’s runway was repaired was in 2007. It has developed potholes and needs urgent repairs. Initially, re-carpeting was to be carried out from December 1, but this was rescheduled,” Rao added.

Had the work begun, operations would have been suspended from midnight to 6 am for the first phase and between 10 am and 6 pm for the second. Airlines had already submitted revised schedule to the airport. 

Rao said the recarpeting could be expedited from mid-May if flight services did not resume. “If they do resume, work will continue in the hours of the day or night as planned,” he added. With both domestic and international flights grounded, the airport now sees operations of cargo planes, charter planes and government choppers on official duty.
