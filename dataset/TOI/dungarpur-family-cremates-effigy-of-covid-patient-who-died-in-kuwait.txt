UDAIPUR: Among many heart piercing incidents being reported from across the country during lockdown, family members of a 56-year-old businessman in south Rajasthan, who died in Kuwait due to coronavirus recently, held a symbolic cremation. Dileep Kalal, a hotelier from Simalwada town of Dungarpur district, had been working in Kuwait for the past 15 years. He died on Monday after being treated in a hospital for a fortnight in the Gulf nation. 

Due to the lockdown, his body could not be flown back to India and so his nephew and a few hotel staff buried him in Kuwait. A video of the burial rites was sent to the family. 

Back home, Dileep’s wife, children and family members were heart broken after knowing about his demise. 

More painful to them was that the funeral could not be held according to Hindu customs and that his soul would not be in peace. 

Elders in the family then suggested to hold a symbolic funeral. Dileep's effigy was made using his clothes and his photograph was kept in place of the head. A turban too was tied as per the rituals and the final procession was taken out in a pickup van where 8-10 family members including his son Roshan, brothers Rajesh, Naresh and Prakash took part to perform the rites. The dummy was taken to the cremation ground on Sakarsi Road where the rituals were held properly. 

The family members said they did not feel for a moment that they were doing an artificial act. “We could not be by his side when he breathed his last. Atleast now after following the rituals properly, we have some relief that his soul would be at peace. The ashes and remains would be immersed in holy waters and so all the other mourning rituals would be performed for our emotional satisfaction,” a close relative said. 

Dileep is learnt to have had last visited Dungarpur six months ago. He is survived by wife, son and a daughter, both married.
