2020-03-30
Hyderabad: In his latest episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to two Covid-19 survivors, including Ram Gampa Teja, an IT professional from Hyderabad, who told the PM that quarantine was not a punishment and there was no stigma attached to the disease.

Teja told PM Modi he was scared after he tested positive for coronavirus but felt reassured because of the doctors and hospital staff. 

“I work in the IT sector and had gone to Dubai for an official meeting. I got fever as soon as I returned and after five to six days the doctors conducted a test and I was found positive,” Teja said, while sharing his experience during the radio telecast. 

“Although I was scared in the beginning, the doctors and nurses at Gandhi Hospital took good care of me and gave me the strength and assurance to overcome the situation,” said Teja, whose parents living in Mahendra hills faced social boycott for days.

When PM asked Teja about the response from his family, he said that he was relieved after they tested negative. “I was really worried for them but I heaved a sigh of relief after it was found that no other family member has got infected,” he said. 

Teja further stressed the fact that quarantine is not a punishment. “Being in quarantine is for our own good. Quarantine is not a prison. People should know that there is no stigma attached to it,” he added. 

The PM also requested Teja to share his experience on social media. “ It will help remove fear from people’s minds and make them aware of the necessary precautions to protect themselves,” he said.

Modi also spoke with Ashok Kapoor, a resident of Agra, who along with his five family members, recovered from Covid-19.
