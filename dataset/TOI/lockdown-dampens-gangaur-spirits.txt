Lockdown dampens Gangaur spirits
2020-03-29
Jaisalmer: The threat of coronavirus outbreak played spoilsport to the celebration of the Gangaur festival in Jaisalmer. The festival, observed by married women and even unmarried girls, could not be celebrated with the traditional fanfare and fervour, as district administration has been strictly monitoring that people do not violate the lockdown and social distancing rules. The women thus could not immerse the Gangaur idols, neither could they take out any procession for the same. As per the tradition in Jaislamer, women celebrate this festival for 18 days and the Gangaur idols are immersed in the Gadisar lake. But this time the women were disappointed as district administration was strict due to which they could not immerse the idols and nor move around in groups. The women immersed the Gangaur at the peepal trees near their houses instead. The Gangaur idols are worshipped for 18 days and are immersed on chaturthi. Although at other places, Gangaur is immersed on teej. On Friday, women observed a fast and a few of them went to the Gadisar lake in a group, but the police sent them back. District administration, issuing an order, had appealed to the women to immerse their Gangaur near their houses. On Gangaur festival usually, the royal family takes out royal procession. On chaturthi, a grand procession is taken out in the market and in the late evening, a fair is organized at Gadisar lake where bholavani takes place. This time, the royal procession was not taken out. SDO Dinesh Vishnoi had asked people to immerse Gangaur near peepal trees and also directed to close all mosques.
