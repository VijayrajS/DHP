AMU faces ‘lockdown’ as 10k to boycott exam
2020-01-29
AGRA: Demanding resignation of vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor and registrar Abdul Hamid, over 10,000 students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have decided to boycott examination from Wednesday, putting the varsity administration in a tight spot.


Students of almost all the streams, including commerce, management, science, art, social science, life science and law are part of the protest, the administration confirmed. The protesting bloc includes 3,095 students from AMU’s Women’s College. The protesting bloc has announced a “lockdown” from Wednesday.

One of the women students, Sadaf Shakeel, who is leading the protest at Women’s College, told TOI, “Students feel insecure on campus after the incidents which took place on December 15 and January 26.” Students were allegedly beaten up on December 15 by security forces, who entered the campus after getting permission from the registrar and the VC. Four students were also detained on January 26 for shouting slogans against the VC.

University spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said that the administration is trying to persuade the agitators against the boycott.
