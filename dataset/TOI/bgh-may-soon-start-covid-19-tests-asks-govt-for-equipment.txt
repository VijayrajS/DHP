Bokaro: The Steel Authority of India Limited-run Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) may soon begin testing samples for Covid-19. The public utility service arm of the PSU has begun working out modalities with the state government to start the facility at the earliest.

Though BGH was declared a Covid-19 centre, swab samples from the hospital were tested at Jamshedpur’s MGMMCH and later, when PMCH started the facility, the hospital sent the samples to Dhanbad for testing.

BGH sources said SAIL chairman Anil Kumar Chaudhary recently held a discussion with state health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni to start testing samples at BGH. Talking to TOI on Saturday, Kulkarni said, “We are working on a proposal with SAIL to set up a Covid-19 testing laboratory at BGH. Things are at an initial stage and SAIL has asked the state government to provide equipment for the laboratory while they will provide the infrastructure support.”

This is will be the second township where SAIL will join hands with a state government to test samples for Covid-19. On April 16, SAIL along with the Odisha government, set up a Covid testing laboratory at Ispat General Hospital (IGH) in Rourkela. 

Director, medical services, BGH, Dr A K Singh said, “We have identified the space and manpower required for the facility. The list of required equipment has been provided to the state government and we are awaiting a formal consent.”

The hospital currently has no Covid-19 patient after it recently cured and discharged nine active cases.
