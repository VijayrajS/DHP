AGRA: Aligarh police on Monday booked a local caterer for violating lockdown rules as he was found celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary with friends and relatives in a Covid-19 containment zone.


 A video of the event went viral on social media, forcing the cops to take action. According to police, the caterer, Pavan Varshney, had thrown a party on Sunday and about 15 people were present at the event held in the containment zone of Sansigate. 

Even though there was a 100 per cent lockdown in the area, Varshney celebrated without following social distancing norms.

 In the video, it is clearly seen the people participating in the celebration are not wearing facial masks even as they dance together outside the house.
