NEW DELHI: In a heartening turnaround, number of daily recoveries of para-military personnel who were detected as Covid-19 positive, have begun to far exceed the new cases added everyday. This is true for BSF, CRPF and ITBP and comes after the ministry of health and family welfare recently relaxed its guidelines for discharge of Covid-19 patients from healthcare facilities. 



In BSF, 135 personnel have recovered so far, bringing down the number of active cases in the force to 208. Since Friday, 16 new Covid-positive cases were reported in the force. While 37 BSF personnel — including 24 in Tripura, 5 in Delhi, 6 in Kolkata and 2 in Tekanpur — were cured earlier, 98 more — 42 in Jodhpur, 31 in Tripura and 25 in Delhi — were discharged from the hospital on Friday after testing negative. The 98 have been placed under quarantine as per protocol. 

In CRPF, 44 personnel of the 31st battalion —which had turned a Covid-19 hotspot after many personnel tested positive — have recovered and been discharged. In contrast, only 5 positive cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Total recovered cases in CRPF now total 51, and active cases, 233. 

ITBP did not report a single new positive case in the past 24 hours. So far, 22 ITBP personnel who had contracted Corona virus have recovered. This brings down the tally of infected personnel in ITBP to 151. 

As per the new discharge policy framed by MoHFW, mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-positive patients can be discharged after 10 days (considering from the day symptoms appeared) if they did not have any fever for 3 days. Before the discharge, Covid-19 test (RT-PCR) is not performed. For moderate cases admitted to DCHC (Oxygen beds) too, no RT-PCR test will be done before discharge. If the fever resolves in three days and oxygen saturation is maintained above 95% for minimum 4 days, the patient can be discharged. Where the patient demands oxygen and fever is not resolved within 3 days, discharge can only be given after the clinical symptoms are resolved and the patient is able to maintain oxygen saturation for 3 consecutive days.
