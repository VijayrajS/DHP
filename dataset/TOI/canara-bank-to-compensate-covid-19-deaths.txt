2020-04-08
Mumbai: Canara Bank has announced a compensation of Rs 20 lakh to legal heirs of employees in case of death due to Covid-19 up to September 2020. Earlier, SBI had announced cash compensation of Rs 20 lakh in the event of death due to the virus.

“Bank employees need to interact with the public day in and day out. Bank staffers serving customers and the country at large are facing severe challenges and risks on account of the spread of the coronavirus. Considering the serious condition prevailing in the country, the competent authority has decided to pay Rs 20 lakh as compensation to legal heirs in case of unfortunate death of any employee,” the circular said. It added that in case of hospitalisation due to the coronavirus, the guidelines applicable to the Indian Banks Association medical insurance policy will apply. 

Meanwhile, Tata AIA Life Insurance has said it will provide additional benefits related to Covid-19 for its policyholders and agents without additional cost. Those already hold Tata AIA policies get an additional Rs 5 lakh (or an amount equivalent to the sum insured, whichever is lower) for death claims due to Covid-19. This benefit is applicable for all valid death claims with a date of death on or before June 30, 2020. Further, Tata AIA’s agents along with their spouse and children are entitled to up to Rs 25,000 hospitalisation cover if diagnosed with Covid-19 within the period as well.

Besides employees, SBI has said that it will provide Rs 10-lakh compensation to heirs of its 61,000 business correspondents in case of death due to the coronavirus infection.
