Lockdown leash on pet shop owners
2020-05-08
Coimbatore: Pet shops have been opening shutters across the city in a phased manner since Wednesday.While pet owners are relieved as they can stock up on feed, the shop owners heaved a sigh of relief as taking care of the pets is not a complicated task anymore. The lockdown proved a particularly trying ordeal, said vice-president of the Pet Shop Owners Association Suresh, who runs Kovai Pets Mart. “Owners of dogs and fish who wanted to sell them had to leave them behind in the shop. We had to get a permission letter from the collector to visit the shop for half-an-hour in the morning and evening to take care of them. Even with the letter, police used to stop us. Several roads were barricaded, and it was very difficult to reach our shops,” he told TOI.Shop owners who stay in small houses and sell small dog breeds and puppies struggled the most. “We had to keep them inside the house because they require fan or air conditioner as it is summer,” said S P Mahendran who runs Best Pet Shop on Marudhamalai Road. “That complicated things at home and for the animals.”They also suffered financially, said president of the association S Saravana Kumar, who runs Quality Pet Shops at Kavundampalayam. “Landlords demanded rent for March and April though we told them that we were making no revenue. We had to handle maintenance of the shop, animals, aquarium equipment, our staff salaries and electricity without revenue. Some banks are yet to give us an EMI break.”A few loyal customers buying feed was their only source of revenue during the period, Kumar said. “Some people choose to buy feed from us as we prescribe the quantity required, timing to provide the feed and how to add nutrition.”“The business of selling pets can improve only after the lockdown is lifted. When everyone is locked down and finding it hard to meet their own requirements, the chance of them taking on the responsibility of another life is less,” Kumar said.
