LUCKNOW: Two policemen were brutally assaulted and bundled out of a quarantine centre in Deoria late Saturday after they responded to an SOS call from inmates, in what was the 20th attack on cops in UP since lockdown was clamped, leaving 100 of them critically injured in a 68-day span.

The situation was brought under control after injured constables dialled police control room for reinforcements and the accused gram pradhan and his five goons were brought to book. The incident occurred at Pahadpur Purani Primary School in Khampar area of Deoria district, when the cops were enquiring about problems faced by inmates.

SHO Khampar, Sudesh Sharma, said, he dispatched two constables, Rajesh Kumar and Satendra Kumar, to a quarantine centre after a call on UP 112. “When they were talking to inmates, an altercation ensued with the gram pradhan, who was joined by five aides. They thrashed the cops and brutally dragged them out of the quarantine centre. We immediately dispatched a team to control the situation,” said Sharma.

The pradhan and his aides have been booked for attempt to murder, causing hurt to public servant on duty and Epidemic Act.
