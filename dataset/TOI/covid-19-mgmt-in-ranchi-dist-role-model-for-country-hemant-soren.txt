Covid-19 mgmt in Ranchi dist role model for country: Hemant Soren
2020-05-18
Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Sunday dubbed the Ranchi district administration’s Covid-19 management as a ‘role model’ for the country. 

In his official Twitter handle, Hemant posted a newspaper clipping of a Hindi daily’s report which claimed that Ranchi’s recovery rate stood at 80%. “The credit goes to Ranchi district administration, health workers, policemen, sanitation workers and volunteers for this feat,” he tweeted. 

Ranchi, which emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hotspot in Jharkhand, reported 104 cases since March 31, including one from Tupudana in Namkum on Sunday. The district administration claimed that out of the total, two patients died and 85 were discharged from Covid-19 facilities after being declared cured. As on Sunday, there were 19 active cases in the district, the administration added.

Besides Hindpiri, fresh containment zones emerged over the weeks. The district’s epidemiology wing said there are at least 13 containment zones across the district. 

Hemant’s words of appreciation for the district officials came at a time when BJP, the state’s biggest opposition party in the Jharkhand assembly, attacked the administration and the JMM-led Mahagatbandhan government for failing to act on the stone-pelters of Hindpiri. 

Condemning the attack on CRPF jawans on Saturday, BJP’s Jharkhand president Deepak Prakash said, “The government has failed to maintain law and order in one particular locality. Under whose pressure is the district administration letting the morale of CRPF jawans dip?” 

The district administration was also in a tight corner last month after several people slipped out of the containment zone in Hindpiri and reached Lohardaga.
