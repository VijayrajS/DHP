HYDERABAD: In perhaps a rare instance, a Covid-19 patient was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly attacking a doctor on coronavirus duty at Gandhi Hospital recently. As he is recuperating at another hospital, police produced the 23-year-old patient and his brother before a court through video conference. The judge remanded them in judicial custody, but the patient would be kept at the hospital itself till he recovers. His brother will be sent for isolation in the prisoner's ward at Gandhi Hospital. 


On April 1, the Covid-19 patient and his brother reportedly attacked a resident doctor on duty after his 56-year-old relative, also a Covid-19 patient, died due to co-morbidities. As junior doctors protested at Gandhi Hospital, a Covid-19 nodal centre, the duo was immediately shifted to another hospital. 


City police warns of jail sentence
Two relatives of another suspect were arrested on Wednesday for attacking a PG medical student at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) on Tuesday. Family members of the quarantined man had beaten up the PG medico demanding that he be discharged. The man’s test later turned up positive. The two relatives were produced before a court through video conference.

All the four accused were booked under Sections 332, 188 , 269, 270, 271 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and the Telangana Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions Act, 2008.

“Hyderabad city police is committed to taking prompt action against anyone who attacks doctors or medical staff,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said.

He warned that any person attacking a doctor would be arrested.
