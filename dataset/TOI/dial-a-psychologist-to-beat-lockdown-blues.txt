West Bengal: Dial a psychologist to beat lockdown blues
2020-05-06
KOLKATA: The state government has started a tele-counselling facility to help people who are either under institutional quarantine or in-home isolation to deal with the stress. The counselling facility has been extended to people in quarantine or who are confined at home due to the lockdown. Mental health experts said that reaching out to people under stress was the need of the hour.


“This is a right step because the amount of stress people are going through during this pandemic, whether one is Covid-19 positive, a suspect or others,” said Sanjay Garg consultant Mental Health and behavioural sciences at Fortis Hospital Anandapur.

“In case of people in home isolation or at quarantine centres, the stress could range from the fear or uncertainty of being infected to the inability to meet their family members,” he added. Garg has been regularly counselling Covid patients to allay their fear and anxiety.

On Tuesday, the state health department issued a circular on its decision to reach out to those stressed. Accordingly, the department has drawn up a list of professional psychologists to provide counselling over phone free of cost. The [person will have to book a slot when the counsellor can reach out to him or her.

According to mental health professionals, the lockdown has turned life topsy-turvy for many. Specially working women are at the receiving end. They are now working from home and are having to take additional charge of the household chores while dealing with children, who, too, are under stress. 

Doctors said even healthcare professionals are under a lot of stress.
