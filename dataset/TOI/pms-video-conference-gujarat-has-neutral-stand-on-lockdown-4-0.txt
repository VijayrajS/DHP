Gandhinagar: The Gujarat government has maintained its stance of not articulating any opinion on extending or lifting the lockdown. However, at the PM’s video conference held with all state governments, Gujarat has categorically suggested that more economic activities ought to be allowed.Key government sources said that since deciding on lockdown 4.0 is a national issue, the state government basically provided an action taken report (ATR). The state government however, has suggested that more economic activities than those allowed in lockdown 3.0 should be opened up. The state government also apprised the Union government of measures taken to resolve the industrial labour crisis through labour law reforms.”Sources added that most chief ministers were of the opinion that the scope of economic activities should be increased, so it is expected that the government may further ease restrictions when lockdown 3.0 ends on May 17. “While restrictions are expected to stay in force in red zones, there could be further easing of restraints in orange and green zones,” sources added.Chief minister Vijay Rupani, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, chief secretary Anil Mukim, CM’s chief principal secretary K Kailashnathan and few other key officials attended the video conference of states with the Union government, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday.
