Madurai: Hours after tying the knot, a groom from Chennai who had come to Virudhunagar for the occasion, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday.

The man from Tambaram in Chennai, was betrothed to Banu of R R Nagar in Virudhunagar two months ago. As the lockdown was enforced, the families could not go ahead with the wedding. 

When the easing of lockdown began, they decided to conduct the wedding in Virudhunagar, as Chennai was witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases. So, the groom and his family members came to Virudhunagar, a few days ago.

They were screened at the checkpost in Virudhunagar district border and their swabs taken. Later, the families went about with their scheduled programme and conducted the marriage as a low-key affair on Sunday.

Meanwhile, as the result of the groom came out positive, health workers from the Ammapatti public health centre went to their house and took him to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai.

Virudhunagar district collector R Kannan said that contact tracing is being done in the area. People, who attended the marriage would also be tested.
