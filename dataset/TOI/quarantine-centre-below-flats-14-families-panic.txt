Quarantine centre below flats, 14 families panic
2020-05-09
Nagpur: An institutional quarantine centre, set up in a semi-residential building, is giving sleepless nights to people residing in the flats. They are running pillar to post for shifting the centre.The district administration and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has turned a 27-room hotel of three floors into institutional quarantine centre at Dahipur, Untkhana, near Ashok Chowk on Great Nag Road. There are 14 flats on three floors above the hotel. Fourteen families are residing in these flats.One of the flat owners lodged a complaint with the NMC saying, “Our life has turned into a nightmare as all residents are in fear due to the quarantine centre. As of now, 72 persons have been admitted in the centre. Vehicles and ambulances come every hour to the building. We are unable to go to even the ground floor since the centre has opened.”Also, there are residential buildings on two sides and behind the quarantine centre.The move, however, has raised a big question when collector Ravindra Thakare closed down an institutional quarantine centre in a government hostel at Wanadongri buckling under the pressure from Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe. Another quarantine centre in a government hostel at Civil Lines was also shut. Sources said that had not the centres been closed, the NMC would have not required buildings with very less number of rooms.An NMC official said, “District administration facilitates buildings for quarantine centre. We trace and quarantine close contacts of positive persons.”Collector Ravindra Thakare did not respond to TOI calls.
