Indore: In last three days, the load of quarantine facilities has reduced by around 30 per cent due to drastically ‘reducing’ the number of positive cases in Indore.

District administration has created 46 quarantine facilities to keep 2,000 people of primary and secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients. In last few days, administration has released 533 inmates on completing 14 days of incubation period and not showing any symptoms.

“The inmates have been released after they tested negative. They are put on 14-day home isolation and have been asked to take required precautions and approach medical team on facing any health related issue,” IDA CEO and nodal officer Vivek Shotriya told TOI.

He added that 362 quarantine inmates have been shifted to hospitals after developing symptoms in this duration.

“With decline in number of positive patients in last few days, there is also drop in total number of people, primary and secondary contact of Covid-19 patients being sent to quarantine facilities,” he said, adding that if one patient is found positive, an average of five of their contacts are being sent to quarantine facilities.

On April 16, Indore has reported 245 positive patients but in next three days, the figure had dropped down to 50, nine and seven respectively.

The nodal officer said that on Monday, 25 inmates were released from different quarantine facilities while 37 were sent there.

He added that in days to come, about five quarantine facilities will be converted into Covid Care Centre to admit asymptomatic patients.
