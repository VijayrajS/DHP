BAREILLY: A 35-year-old doctor of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) from Moradabad, who tested positive for Covid-19 and was undergoing treatment at TMU medical college, died on Monday. 

Health officials said that the BAMS doctor was deputed at a PHC in Tajpur area and had been moving door to door, to screen Tablighi Jamaat members in the district. He was admitted to an isolation ward as he developed Covid-like symptoms eight days ago. With this, the death toll in the district rose to three. 

Moradabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr MC Garg told TOI, “The doctor was a resident of Ismaeel Road under Galshaheed police station and was deputed at a primary healthcare centre (PHC) under Bhojpur police station. After testing positive around 10 days ago, he was admitted to isolation ward of TMU medical college. He was kept on ventilator as his condition was critical from the start. Despite best efforts and medication, he died while undergoing treatment.” 

The CMO added, “Five members of his family have been quarantined. We have also started enquiring about the people the doctor may have come in contact with. Also, the tally is set to rise in coming days as the district is now on high alert and not complying with the lockdown norms, especially in hotspots, could be very risky.”

As many as 18 fresh Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the district on Sunday. This includes six children under age of six, and four women. Till Sunday, the tally was 55. All the 18 people were quarantined by health department after it was known that they came in contact with Jamaat members a few days ago.
