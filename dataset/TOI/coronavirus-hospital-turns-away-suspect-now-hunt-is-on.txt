2020-01-31
GWALIOR: A 30-year-old patient, who returned from China a week ago and turned up at Gwalior district hospital on Thursday with coronavirus-like symptoms, was told to go back home. 


This, only a day after health minister Tulsiram Silawat ordered a statewide alert on the virus that has killed 170 people in China. The administration is frantically looking for the patient. Chief medical and health officer Dr Mridul Saxena has sought explanations from the civil surgeon B K Gupta and the doctor who treated him.
