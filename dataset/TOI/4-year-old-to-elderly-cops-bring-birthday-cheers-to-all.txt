2020-04-19
NEW DELHI: As Roshina Gautam woke up on Saturday, she didn’t expect her 71st birthday to be celebrated during the lockdown. However, she was in for a surprise after she heard police sirens in her Greater Kailash-I neighbourhood. A group of police officers were outside her door with a potted plant, singing happy birthday for her. 

However, Fatehpur Beri police station saw an even more touching scene the same day, when the cops threw a surprise birthday party for the four-year-old daughter of a labourer. The labourer’s family is among 100 such needy ones that come to the station for their meals.

The SHO arranged a cake and a party cap for the child. The girl sat down with her friends and all of them ate lunch together while maintaining social distancing. The community kitchen at the police station has been providing meals to the labourers and slum dwellers in the area. The judges of Delhi high court have been contributing for the kitchen as well. 

When Gautam’s neighbours saw the cops outside her residence, they thought there had been a robbery, or someone had tested positive for Covid-19. However, when they realised it was a birthday celebration, a smile was seen on everyone’s faces.

“I was very touched that the officers came in the middle of their hectic schedule to wish me. Once they sang the birthday song, all the neighbours also joined in.” said Gautam. 

Along with the septuagenarian, Delhi Police spread cheer by celebrating the birthday of a 15-year old boy and the 25th marriage anniversary of a couple in the same way.
