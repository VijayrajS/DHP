Covid-19: NRKs worried as UAE shuts doors on resident visa holders
2020-03-20
KOZHIKODE: The temporary ban by the UAE government on entry of resident visa holders who are currently outside the country has in effect made the ongoing Covid-19 related travel disruptions for NRKs to the Gulf almost complete.

The decision, imposed as part of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, is for a period of two weeks, subject to renewal. The UAE is home to 8.3 lakh NRKs and the announcement has caught many expats who had come on leave or had sent their family members home unawares. With this, all the six GCC countries, except Bahrain, now have travel restrictions in place for expats from India. Other GCC countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar had already announced entry restrictions.

Karipur airport, which has international flights only to the Gulf countries, is left in an unenviable situation of being able to having flights to just one country- Bahrain. The restrictions have severely hit flight operations and passenger traffic with majority of flights getting cancelled.

Airport director K Srinivasa Rao said as of now the only flight that is scheduled to operate is the Air India Express flight to Bahrain.

The UAE had on Wednesday suspended issuance of visas upon arrival and all types of labour permits, including drivers and domestic workers, effective Thursday.

“Though expats are bound to face travel-related uncertainties on the personal front, there is no reason to worry about their jobs or visa status as the UAE government is expected to take a considerate view on the matter,” P K Anwar Naha, an NRK based in Dubai said.

The UAE government has requested all residence visa holders outside the UAE to contact the country’s diplomatic missions in their respective countries for support and to provide a way of returning.
