PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday asked officials concerned to increase number of beds in all isolation wards and dedicated Covid hospitals in Bihar in view of return of large number of migrant workers from different parts of the country.

Holding a high-level review meeting on Covid-19 with chief secretary Deepak Kumar and other senior officials here, the CM said protecting people from the virus and providing employment to the returnee migrant workers were the top priorities of the state government in the current scenario.

“Lakhs of migrant workers have already returned to the state and several others are on way. Some returnee migrants have been tested positive for Covid-19. Under the circumstance, it is necessary to increase the number of beds at the isolation wards and dedicated Covid-19 hospitals,” the CM said. 

Nitish said the government has set the target of testing at least 1,000 people per day in the wake of arrival of migrant workers. 

He asked the officials concerned to ensure availability of sufficient RT-PCR, TrueNat, CB-NAT machines and testing kits at the medical institutions to accelerate the state’s testing capacity.

The CM asked the chief secretary to ensure that there should be continuity in supply of PPE kits and other necessary equipment to the dedicated hospitals besides availability of necessary medicines. 

He once again asked the officials to provide employment to the migrant workers who have completed their 14-day quarantine period. “All related departments should ensure that migrant workers are provided employment,” the CM added.
