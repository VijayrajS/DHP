Lucknow: Terming Tablighi Markaz as factory of new coronavirus, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has apprehended that the congregation of thousands of people at Nizamuddin West in Delhi could potentially foil the very objective of the nationwide lockdown which was announced with an aim to arrest the spread of the Covid-19.

VHP president VS Kokje, VHP international working president Alok Kumar and general secretary Milind Parande in a joint statement issued late on Thursday evening demanded that instead of getting the holed up people out of masjids, markaz and madrassas, the Centre and the state government should isolate and quarantine them there only to prevent the spread of new coronavirus.

The VHP leaders said that when all other religious places have been closed, people from the Muslim community should also come forward to close masjids across the country till the crisis is over. The right wing leaders demanded that the government should cancel visas granted to the maulvis who had arrived in India from foreign countries and strict legal action be initiated against them.

The VHP prescribed a mandatory ‘daah sanskaar’ for those who died due to Covid-19 without taking their religion into consideration. The parishad said that the possibility of the spread of new coronavirus increases manifold if the body of a person who has died due to Covid-19 is buried. “Today our fight is restricted to new coronavirus. Strict action should be taken against those who are not supporting the county in its war against the virus,” the VHP said.
