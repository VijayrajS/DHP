PATNA: An 18-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by two migrant workers staying at a quarantine centre and four others from the same village under Dawath police station in Rohtas district on late Wednesday evening. Two persons were arrested when the victim’s family raised a hue and cry over the police’s callousness and attempt to suppress the issue under political pressure. 

An FIR was lodged by the survivor on Thursday against Suresh Yadav (22), Vijay Yadav (20), Chanchal Yadav (22), Mukesh Yadav (21), Chulli Paswan (18) and Amit Paswan (18). Her medical examination was conducted at Sasaram Sadar hospital on Friday. 

Rohtas SP Satyaveer Singh said two of the accused — Suresh and Chanchal — have been arrested. Only they were in the quarantine centre and called the other four from the village on phone. “The incident took place outside the quarantine centre on Wednesday night. The inmates of the facility scaled the boundary wall and committed the offence in a field. They also called their friends from the village on phone,” the SP said after visiting the spot on Friday. The incident took place around 9.30pm when the girl had gone to answer the call of nature in a field for lack of toilet in her house. The victim narrated the ordeal to her family members, who reached the quarantine centre and created a scene demanding action against the accused, who were kept there in 14-day quarantine. The samples of the two accused have been sent for Covid-19 test.
