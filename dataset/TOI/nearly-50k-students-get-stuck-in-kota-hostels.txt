KOTA: Nearly 50,000 students from across the country, preparing for entrance exams in medical and engineering colleges in various institutes in Kota, are stuck in their hostels and PGs following lockdown of public transportation.


Several coaching institutes have come up with helpline and support staff to help the students. Although, many students are engaged in online tests for preparing for the NEET-UG and other engineering entrance exams.

While most of the students have left for their home towns, around 30-40% students are stuck in various hostels and PG since they could not get transportation to travel home due to the lockdown, Nitesh Sharma of Allen Career institute said.

Besides creating a support staff to help students staying in hostels, a round-the-clock helpline number has also been issued for the students to call if they need anything, so that they donâ€™t have to step out and can focus on their upcoming exams, he added.
