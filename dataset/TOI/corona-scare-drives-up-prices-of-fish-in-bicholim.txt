BICHOLIM: Fearing that coronavirus could have infected chicken, villagers in Bicholim have reduced poultry consumption, and this has had an impact on the prices of fish. News of avian flu cases reported in some states has also caused an aversion towards chicken. 

Mackerels are being sold at Rs 100 for two pieces, while medium-sized kingfish is being sold for anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000, a portion of crabs for Rs 300, and pomfrets are retailing at Rs 500 per portion. Similarly, prices of a kilogram of prawns have gone up to Rs 500.

The inflated prices have hit residents, who are used to consuming local fish, hard. Ramnath Naik from Karapur said that they cannot afford such high prices. “We cannot eat fish because it has become costly, and we cannot eat chicken due to fear of coronavirus,” said Purushottam Alvi, a Sakhali resident.
