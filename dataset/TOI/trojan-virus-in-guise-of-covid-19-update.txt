Trojan virus in guise of Covid-19 update
2020-06-02
AURANGABAD: Banking institutions have warned customers against a Trojan virus called Cerberus which looks like a legitimate software providing updates on Covid-19, but actually is a malicious software that helps in stealing, damaging and disrupting data or network.


In an advisory issued to account holders, banks have cited an alert from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and asked for the utmost caution. Trojan is a type of malicious code or software that looks genuine but with the capability of taking control of one's computer or phone

“The CBI has alerted about the malicious software- Cerberus – which can infect mobile phones and steal data. Cerberus is a type of malicious software that looks legitimate,” Bank of Maharashtra (BoM), a public sector bank, has said to its customers in the latest communication. 

The malicious software contacts smartphone users via text messages and asks users to click on a link providing Covid-19 updates. 

“When clicked, the link installs a malicious application on the users’ phone, which extracts sensitive financial data. The trojan can also use overlay attacks to trick victims into providing personal information and can capture two-factor authentication details,” BoM has said.

An overlay attack happens when an attacker places a window over a legitimate application on the device. The trojan virus has the ability to take screenshots, hijack messages, steal contact lists and account credentials among other things.

“Do not download and install applications from untrusted sources. Install applications from reputed application market. Verify app permissions and grant only those permissions which have relevant context,” as per an advisory.

In mobile settings, customers are advised not to enable an installation app from ‘untrusted sources’. Also, customers are asked to avoid using unsecured, unknown Wi-Fi network.
