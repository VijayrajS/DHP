Kolhapur: The state government has formed two committees to assess the impact of national lockdown on cooperative financial institutions in urban and rural areas. 

The panels have been asked to study the finance option for the farmers and professionals/salaried persons. 

The cooperative, marketing and textile department issued an order on Wednesday announcing formation of the committees, comprising government officials and representatives of cooperative financial institutions. 

The first committee has been asked to study the impact of national lockdown on the functioning and finance of urban cooperative banks and credit societies. The order has said that lending money to professionals and salaried persons was the backbone of urban cooperative banks and credit societies. 

“The national lockdown was bound to affect functioning and the committee has been asked to make recommendations, which can be implemented after lockdown is lifted,” the order added.

The second committee has been asked to study possible effects of lockdown on the functioning of cooperative institutions that play a crucial role in providing loans to the farmers. These institutions, including district central coopertive banks and village level credit society, deposit the amount of all the government schemes into the bank accounts of the farmers. 

Both the committees have been asked to submit their reports within two months. Maharashtra has a strong network of cooperative finance institutions with over 2 lakh institutes.
