LUCKNOW: Two persons each escaped from quarantine facilities in Hardoi and Azamgarh in a span of 48 hours. A massive search operation was launched in both districts. While the duo in Azamgarh was caught, the two in Hardoi have been traced but not nabbed. 

So far, as many as 600 people have escaped from different quarantine centres in Sultanpur, Hathras, Azamgarh, Hardoi, Bahraich and Sitapur over the past seven weeks. Most of them were traced and have been booked. On Tuesday night, two migrants from Delhi were quarantined at Divyananda PG College in Sandila, Hardoi. Next day, the local corporator informed authorities that the duo was missing. 

“We had launched a manhunt but could not catch them. However, on Thursday evening, informers told us that they were hiding at a relative’s place,” said sub-inspector OP Singh, in charge of the quarantine centre. They are yet to be nabbed. He said that senior officials will take a call on whether an FIR will be registered in the incident. 

In Azamgarh, SP Triveni Singh said the duo who had escaped was nabbed and an inquiry would be conducted.
