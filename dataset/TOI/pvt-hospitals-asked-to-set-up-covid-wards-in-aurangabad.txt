AURANGABAD: Terming the Covid-19 outbreak as a ‘public health emergency’, the district administration has asked private hospitals in the city to form special wards for the healthcare of positive patients 

Acting on the directives of the state government, district collector Uday Chaudhari has asked the private hospitals with a bed capacity of more than 100 beds to reserve at least 50 per cent of beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “The capacity may be increased step-by-step as per the patient load. We are starting with one dedicated ward of 10 beds to be reserved exclusively for any suspected or confirmed positive case,” he said, adding that every healthcare provider should be ready for treatment of Covid-19 patients. 

The order stated that any healthcare provider cannot deny services to any patient, irrespective of whether the patient is showing Covid-19 symptoms or not. The private hospitals have been also asked to follow guidelines issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and ministry of health to adhere protocols issued for treatment of Covid-19 patients. 

Unmesh Takalkar, director of CIGMA Hospital, said that joint efforts should be taken to keep the Covid-19 outbreak at bay. “Going by the global trends, Covid-19 is likely to stay in India for at least a few months more. The private hospital can play its role in combating disease and reduce pressure on the state health machinery,” he said.

The district administration has also said that care must be taken by the health workers from any unknown asymptomatic carrier of Covid-19. “Use of face mask and physical distancing should be mandatory in hospital premises. Sanitisers must be made available to all the visitors inside the hospital building,” said the administration.
