Soon, more testing machines at three centres, says Rane

Panaji: As Covid-19 cases rose on Sunday, health minister Vishwajit Rane said more Molbio machines — TrueNat testing facility — will be installed at both the district hospitals and sub-district hospital, Ponda.

“The whole idea is to have a strong and robust system in place for testing. Additional machines have been planned to reduce the waiting period for people arriving either by train or air,” Rane said.

Both the district hospitals and the Ponda sub-district hospital started TrueNat testing after Molbio machines were introduced around a month ago. But since May 1, there has been an urgent need for the state to ramp up testing facility as there has been an increase in the number of people coming to the state. 

The health minister said the decision was also taken to test all frontline workers posted at borders and keep them safe. 

Testing facility is being scaled up and chief minister Pramod Sawant has supported the move, he said. 

To further facilitate this, the government will hire additional staff on contract basis — MD/MS in microbiology and technicians — advertisements for which will be released soon, the minister said.

An Abbott M2000 RTPCR machine will be bought following a recent cabinet approval. The machine will be able to test 400 to 500 samples a day, officials said.

Rane said that Rajdhani Express passengers that tested positive have been placed in institutional quarantine and they will remain there for 14 days. They will be tested again after completion of 14 days, he said. Rajdhani Express carrying 368 passengers reached Goa on Sunday afternoon.

“This has been done to rule out the risk of community transmission. We have taken strict measures to keep citizens safe,” the minister said.

The state conducts 600 to 700 tests a day, including tests done at GMC’s virology laboratory.
