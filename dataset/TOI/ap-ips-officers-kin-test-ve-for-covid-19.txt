2020-06-05
Amaravati: With the wife and son of a senior IPS officer working at the DGP’s office testing positive for Covid-19, the state administration has directed all personnel who came in contact with the officer to undergo screening.

While the IPS officer has gone into self-quarantine, the officials who worked with him have also been directed to remain in self-quarantine. The police officer, who worked in districts in the past, had moved to the state police headquarters about a year ago.

An IAS officer had died at the government general hospital (GGH) in Guntur last week. GGH officials had said samples of the IAS officer tested negative for Covid-19. Sources, however, said the IAS officer had complained of fever and breathlessness. —Samdani MN
