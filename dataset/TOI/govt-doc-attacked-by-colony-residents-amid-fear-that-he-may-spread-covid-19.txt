Meerut: A government doctor received fracture in his hand in a brutal attack by residents of his upscale society in Meerut who wanted him to vacate his house over fear that he may “spread” novel coronavirus in the colony. Dr Prashant Bhatnagar is assistant professor at community medicine in Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College.He said, “I have been living in Sector 6 of Shastri Nagar area in Meerut for the last seven years with my family. However, now, these people fear that doctors living in the locality might end up infecting them with coronavirus. The colony residents started forcing me to vacate the house here. When I protested, they thrashed me leading to a fracture in my right hand.”An FIR has been filed against three persons, RS Yadav, Yaduveer and Jugal Sahni under IPC sections 325 (punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).Dr Bhatnagar further said, “I am not even posted in the Covid-19 ward. So locals should keep their doubts aside and not thrash the medical staff.”Meerut police had a different version to offer. Superintendent of police (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said, “The altercation happened over the placement of a guard cabin outside the doctor’s house. The cabin is put outside different houses from time to time. But the doctor protested against its placement outside his house as it blocked his car parking. He was hurt in the altercation and an FIR has been filed in the matter.”
