Cong: Book Dang for violating lockdown
2020-04-02
Bhopal: State Congress on Wednesday alleged that BJP leaders were breaking the restrictions of lockdown during this critical phase when Corona virus is spreading in the country. 

PCC spokesman Durgesh Sharma on Wednesday posted a video in which former MLA Hardeep Singh Dang is seen meeting people along with his supporters and urging them to join the BJP. 

Congress demanded that an FIR be registered against Dang for openly flouting the social distancing and lock-down instructions.

Dang was formerly in the Congress, but, switched loyalties to the BJP last month. He was one of the 22 Congress MLAs and Jyotiraditya Scindia followers who quit Congress and joined the BJP. Dang was in Bengaluru for more than three weeks. He reached his constituency in Suvasra last week after he was inducted into the BJP by party national president JP Nadda. State Congress leaders said that Dang was advised by doctors to stay in self-isolation since he came from Bengaluru where he was residing in a resort along with the other rebel MLAs. But on Tuesday, the former MLA was seen meeting people in Shyamgarh in his constituency in Mandsaur district and urging them to support the BJP.

Sharma said, “I have a humble question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Does the lockdown restriction only apply for the common man and not to BJP leaders and workers?” Sharma also posted a picture of former minister for water resources Narottam Mishra meeting people and distributing essential commodities to people in his Datia constituency. Mishra was also not wearing a mask. “Why has Hardeep Singh Dang taken out a rally on a membership drive knowing full well of the Corona virus pandemic and its dangers on society?”Durgesh Sharma said.
