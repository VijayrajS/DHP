2020-06-06
Margao: Moti Dongor area of Margao which houses a sizeable population of slum dwellers has come under the radar of health authorities. Twenty-five people from the area who were found to have symptoms of Covid-19 during the community health screening conducted on Thursday and Friday were subjected to Covid tests and their results are awaited. 

After it was learnt that a family of six from Moti Dongor had come in contact with a Covid positive patient from Mongor Hill, their swab samples were taken for testing but the reports came negative. However, as a matter of caution, the health authorities undertook health survey and screening of households in the locality since Wednesday morning. The residents were subjected to thermal screening, checked for symptoms and their travel history probed. The family who was earlier subjected to Covid test has currently been kept in isolation, and they will be further subjected to repeat tests soon. 

Panic gripped the residents of Margao as many women from Moti Dongor work as domestic help in many households. Many young men from the area are also employed as drivers or labourers. Several fruits and vegetable vendors in Gandhi market, Margao, also stay in Moti Dongor. As the locality is congested with a large number of hutments, authorities fear a breakout of the virus if any carriers of Covid-19 are left undetected. This, sources said, explains the urgency of authorities in conducting the screening of the area.
