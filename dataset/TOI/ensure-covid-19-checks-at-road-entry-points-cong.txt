Ensure Covid-19 checks at road entry points: Cong
2020-03-08
Panaji: Congress on Saturday said the state government needs to put in place screening checks at all the road entry points in Goa to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Party spokesperson Trajano D’Mello questioned the government on sponsoring and supporting Shigmo at a time when the central government has asked states to cut down on public events to prevent the spread of the virus.

D’Mello also took a dig at health minister Vishwajit Rane, stating that the latter needs to do more to protect local citizens instead of holding press conferences.

“The state government should put checks at all the entry points to the state or give me the health ministry and I will put it in order in 48 hours,” D’Mello said.

The Congressman appeared to suggest that the state government was not doing enough to ensure that the virus does not infect locals. 

“The health minister has created more confusion instead of bringing clarity. He has not said a word on the concrete steps taken by his government,” the spokesperson further said.

Congress also expressed concern over the threat posed by the coronavirus on the March 22 zilla panchayat elections as it would make voters vulnerable to transmission of the virus.

“This election will have ballot papers. Will the stamp be sanitised after every vote? What precautions are being taken for the ZP elections?” D’Mello questioned.

He also said that the virus could spread in educational institutions and in government offices where a lot of people tend to congregate.
