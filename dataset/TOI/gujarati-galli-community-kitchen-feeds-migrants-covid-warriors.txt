Gujarati galli community kitchen feeds migrants, Covid warriors
2020-05-03
Hyderabad: A long queue snakes past Gujarati galli in Koti as migrants and farmers stuck in the city wait for a fresh meal. Ever since the lockdown came into force, a community kitchen in the area has been serving food to at least 1,000 people every day. 

Preparation for the meal starts at 6am. A group of 12 people chop, cook and serve in pairs. Massive ‘khadais’ on stoves can be seen with the meal of the day: On Saturday, it was ‘poori-sabzi’. The Sunday special being planned was ‘pav bhaji’.

“The worst affected by the lockdown are daily wagers. With business coming to a halt in the city, these people are on the roads wondering where their next meal will come from. Seeing their plight, we decided to intervene,” Anjana Mehta, a homemaker, who is among the first to hit on the idea of the community kitchen, told TOI.

Others who are part of the group include Sandeep Shah, Indu Gantra, Bhavesh Metha, Swati Jhawar, Ashok Birla, Gokul Asawa, Lalit Jain, Rajesh Tavdare, Neeta Mehta, Ramchander and Aarti Purohit. 

The kitchen is a gender-neutral space with men also taking part in the cooking. “I began by distributing sanitisers, masks and gloves, but realised that feeding people had to be the first priority. We cannot let people sleep hungry,” Sandeep Shah, a jeweller, said.

After they feed those lined up, the group also takes food to hospitals, orphanages, police and GHMC workers up to Abids. Around 75kg of cooked food is served daily. “The happiness of well-fed people is the only payment we expect,” says Shah. 

Daily wager Muthyam Reddy, who used to get Rs 10,000 a month, says he is dependent on the community kitchen for food. “At least, I don’t have to struggle for a meal,” he says. 

Another beneficiary Venkat Rao, a farmer from Prakasam in Andhra Pradesh, stuck in the city can’t be more thankful. “In the times of crisis like this, it’s their generosity that is keeping us going.”
