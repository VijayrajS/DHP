Hyderabad: Covid-19 helpline proves hard to reach
2020-03-25
HYDERABAD: Though the state government claims to have made enough arrangements deal with Covid-19 cases, reality seems quite different. Despite a 24-hour helpline being set up for Covid-19-related concerns, few are able to get through to authorities, and even if they do, medical teams are not reaching their locality to conduct tests and take the infected to hospitals.



Syed Abdahu Kashaf, a resident of Malakpet, said, “I received a call from a lady who works in HiTec City. She had trouble breathing, high fever and throat pain which are symptoms of corona. I dialled helpline number 104 nearly 6 times, but there was no response.” He tagged minister KT Rama Rao on Twitter and said, “Sir @KTRTRS, we tried calling 104 for 6 times they failed to respond it’s positive case of #COVID-19 she came to Hyderabad on March 17 via flight from Jabalpur. She is ill from 5 days. She stays in a hostel and communicated with more than 50 other women. Please take necessary action.” 

Similarly, P Suresh from Balanagar area said no action had been taken despite authorities being informed about a person who returned from Italy with symptoms of Covid-19.

GHMC deputy commissioner Prashanthi Vangeepuram and Cyberabad police responded after seeing the video on Twitter and collected details. Meanwhile, chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, on Tuesday said, “ For any medical emergency, call 100. Police will take them to hospitals or make arrangements.“
