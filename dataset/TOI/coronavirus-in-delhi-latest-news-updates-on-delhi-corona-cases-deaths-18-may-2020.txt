* Helplines for workers must always be functional: High court
Delhi high court has directed the AAP government to ensure uninterrupted working of its helpline numbers for migrant workers so that they can easily approach nodal officers.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, hearing a PIL through videoconferencing, noted that Delhi government was ready and willing to accept the registration of workers who wanted to migrate.

Whenever these workers approach the nodal officer concerned, all care will be taken by Delhi government for their migration as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Centre on April 29, the bench said on Friday while hearing the PIL seeking a directive to the authorities to register and repatriate migrant workers to their home states and appoint a nodal officer in each district to facilitate the process.


* We won’t leave migrants alone in crisis: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal
Following reports of a large number of migrant workers gathering at the Delhi borders to return to their home states on foot, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the government would arrange trains for them.

As photographs and videos of migrant workers walking along the national highways with their families emerged on social media in the past few days, Kejriwal said it was the responsibility of Delhi government to take care of those who wanted to stay back.


* Traders divided over opening of markets
Some traders’ associations have given a thumbs up to the idea of opening shops on alternate days, while others expressed fear that congested markets may trigger a spurt in Covid-19 cases.

Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal has decided to keep the shops’ shutters down at least till May 31.

“Looking at the number of the novel coronavirus cases reported in Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh markets are likely to be put under the buffer zone. Even if a decision is taken to open the market fully, it won’t be possible for the association to contain infection. It is a congested market and dug up at several places for the redevelopment plan. Implementing social distancing is impossible here,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal.


* No grand opening, but Delhi set to ease norms
Kickstarting economy may lead to slight rise in cases, but ready for challenge, says CM

The ministry of home affairs has given states and UTs the flexibility to delineate red, orange and green zones on the basis of the parameters defined by the health and family welfare ministry and demarcate containment and buffer zones within them.

“Within the red and orange zones, the containment and buffer zones will be demarcated by the district authorities after taking into consideration the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare,” the Centre’s guidelines read, giving Delhi the flexibility to allow all economic activities outside the sealed areas. In zone-wise classification of the districts, the Union health ministry has defined all 11revenue districts in the capital as red zones. Kejriwal had earlier this month written to the Centre demanding the classification to red zones on the basis of municipal wards.


* Delhi government to unveil rules today
The Delhi government on Sunday welcomed the Centre’s guidelines for phase 4 of the national lockdown that allows resumption of economic activities in all three zones, with CM Arvind Kejriwal saying that a detailed plan for the national capital will be announced on Monday.

“Centre’s guidelines are largely in line with the proposal sent by Delhi govt based on suggestions of lakhs of Delhiites. We have used the lockdown period to prepare our healthcare system if corona cases increase, but it is now time to relax the restrictions to some extent. Delhi govt will prepare the detailed plan for Delhi based on the Centre’s guidelines and announce them tomorrow,” Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.
