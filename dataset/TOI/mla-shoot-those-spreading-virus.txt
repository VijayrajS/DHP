2020-04-04
DEHRADUN: Reacting to the allegations of alleged misbehaviour by some members of Tablighi Jamaat who have been quarantined in hospitals, BJP MLA from Udham Singh Nagar, Raj Kumar Thukral said that those who are miebahvaving with doctors and nurses in Uttarakhand should be slapped with National Security Act (NSA) as has been proposed to be done by UP CM Yogi Aditynatah in his state. 


He added that government should pass orders to “shoot those who are spitting at places spreading the virus.” Meanwhile, in Uttarkashi, ten people who defied lockdown guidelines to gather for prayer were booked by city police on Friday. They had gathered at a house situated in Indira Colony of Uttarkashi town. Soon after getting information, a police team reached the spot and arrested all ten people for flouting guidelines.
