2020-04-11
TIRUPATI: The state government on Friday suspended Nagari municipal commissioner K Venkatarami Reddy after he allegedly criticised the administration in a video message that went viral on social media. This is the second instance of an official being suspended for accusing the government of inaction over Covid-19 crisis in the last three days.


The government has charged the municipal commissioner with passing unlawful comments during the Covid-19 crisis, and issued orders suspending him under sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Services (APCS) Rules, 1991.

In a video that was circulated on Thursday, the municipal commissioner was heard saying that the state government did not provide funds or protective equipment to municipal staff in Nagari town to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.

“The municipality did not receive any funds from the government to deal with Covid-19 crisis despite the vulnerable situation prevailing in Nagari with four people testing positive,” the commissioner alleged.

“Nagari municipality did not receive proper support from the state government. We did not get any protective equipment for the emergency services staff, who are on the streets to tackle the situation. All our accounts are frozen and we have not got any financial aid from the government,” the commissioner said in the video.

In the same video, he also praised YSRC legislator RK Roja for going out of the way to extend support to tackle the crisis in Nagari, which is her assembly constituency.

AP government had on Wednesday suspended a doctor in Visakhapatnam district after his video message criticising the government over Covid-19 went viral
