2020-05-04
Surat: Mumbai-headquartered Lab Care Diagnostics (India) Pvt. Ltd is all set to begin manufacturing of ‘Made in India’ rapid antibody test kits for the early detection of the Covid-19 at its unit at Umbergaon in Valsad distrit.The company had received approval from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the rapid antibody and RT-PCR test kits about a fortnight ago.This week, the manufacturing will begin at its unit located in Sarigam GIDC in Umbergaon, company officials said.“The production of the test kits will start in the next three days. We will manufacture about 1.5 lakh test kits per day to cater to the huge demand in the country,” said Ravi Chadha, founder of Lab Care Diagnostics.The company claims that the rapid test kits will give results in 15 minutes. The kit will come in the packet size of 25 tests and 50 tests.After the rapid COVID-19 test kits imported from China were found to be faulty, the ICMR has halted the use of the rapid antibody test kits for the time being. So far, India has relied on the definitive RT-PCR test kits which involves taking a throat swab.The rapid antibody testing helps in examining whether the person has developed antibodies in his or her blood stream to fight the SARS-CoV-2, which indicates whether a person has been exposed to or has Covid-19. Chadha added, “It took us more than three months to develop the rapid antibody test kits and RT-PCR at our facility.”
