VISAKHAPATNAM: Scare of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) took a toll on city’s Holi celebrations this year. While people did celebrate in the festival of colours, the numbers were far less than usual. Many schools and colleges also remained open.

Holi in Visakhapatnam is usually celebrated with Holi-bashes and rain dances on the Beach Road. Event managers plan grand programmes for over a week. In 2018, a Spain-style La Tomatina festival was also celebrated.

However, not this time. While people largely kept away from celebrations, the police did not give special permissions for events. Celebrations were largely limited to some hotels.

Speaking to TOI, Ch Adinarayana, ACP (traffic) said that the police did not notice large crowds celebrating this year. Generally, the police deploy special teams, “but this year we did not feel any pressure as there were no big crowds on the beach,” Adinarayana said.

K Rama Rao, the owner of a departmental store at Sivaji Park said that instead of buying colours and water guns, people are buying hand sanitizers and masks.

Meanwhile, Parvati, who sells eggs at the beach, said that while she sold over 500 eggs last year, this year she sold less than a hundred eggs.
