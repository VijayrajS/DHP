Dharwad: Dharwad district on Saturday registered the second Covid-19 death with a 70-year-old man succumbing to the virus. 

According to officials, the septagenerian (P-6258) is a native of Shantiniketan Colony in Bhairidevarkoppa of Hubballi. He had returned from Mumbai (where he lived), and was admitted to KIMS Hospital in Hubballi as he was suffering from cardiac problems and died of cardiac arrest. He was also tested positive for coronavirus.

Meanwhile, 20 more persons (11 male and nine female, including five children) have tested positive in the district for Covid-19, taking the total number of such cases to 111. 

The spike in the number of positive cases has triggered fears of cluster spread in Hubballi. Of the 20 positive cases, 18 are the family members of those who have already tested positive. This includes two patients: 29-year-old woman (P-6522) who has returned from Delhi, and 27-year-old man (P-6532) who has returned from Maharastra. 

Of the 111 positive cases, 50 have been cured and discharged (including two on Saturday), leaving the district with 61 active cases.
