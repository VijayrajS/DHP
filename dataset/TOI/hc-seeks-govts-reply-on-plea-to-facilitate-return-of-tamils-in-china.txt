2020-02-01
MADURAI: Madras high court has directed the central and state governments to file a counter on a plea which sought to facilitate the safe return of Tamil people who are stranded in China following the coronavirus outbreak.

M Samayaselvam, a resident of Madurai and state secretary of the youth wing of Tamil Nadu Construction Workers Union in his petition stated that the association works on assisting Tamils working abroad for their safe return to India in case of any mishap or any untoward incidents.

Following the outbreak of coronavirus in China, he has been receiving several phone calls from the Tamils including students who are presently in China. He said that they are in fear following the outbreak and though they want to travel back to their homeland, they are unable to return due to quarantine regulations.

Hence, he moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to direct the authorities concerned to provide medical treatment for Tamils affected by coronavirus in China and also sought to facilitate their return.

When the petition was heard on Friday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran gave the direction to the central and state governments and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.
