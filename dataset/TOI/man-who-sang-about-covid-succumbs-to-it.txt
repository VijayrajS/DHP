2020-05-22
AHMEDABAD: Umesh Sadhu, 46, a resident of Behrampura, in April had released a single ‘Corona e kalo ker karyo’ (Corona(virus) has wreaked havoc) to the tune of Har Desh Main Tu, appealing to citizens to follow the rules of the lockdown, maintain social distancing and wear masks. After a month, Sadhu succumbed to the virus.


Pappu Sadhu, his elder brother, said Umesh was interested in singing from young age and was part of several dayro, bhajan and santvani events over the years. “The said single was created by a city-based record company along with Popatlal Tapodhan, a city-based artist. Who would have thought that the virus that he sang against would claim his life?” he said.

Umesh, who was suffering from hypertension and diabetes, felt uneasy on April 30 and was admitted to the Civil Hospital where he succumbed on May 8.
