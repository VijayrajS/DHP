Telangana: ‘Gully warriors’ help fight Covid-19 in Adilabad district
2020-06-11
HYDERABAD: The Adilabad district administration has deployed ‘gully warriors’ to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. During the lockdown, their responsibility was to see that there were no violations. And now, their services are being used in different spheres to help the administration in its combat against Covid-19.


Interestingly, the gully warriors helping the district administration are the same people who were caught violating the lockdown rules. “The lockdown violators were trained on the measures that were being taken to prevent the spread of the virus. They are responsible to educate people against coming out on to the roads and also help the administration,” district collector A Sri Devasena said. 

She said there was not a single Covid-19 death in the district though positive cases were reported from Adilabad initially. “All who tested positive have recovered. Subsequently, there have been positive cases from those who came from other states. At the end of their quarantine period and isolation, they have also recovered,” Devasena told TOI on Wednesday. Asked about a multi-disciplinary central health team’s visit to Adilabad, she said she had got no such official communication so far. “As of now, there are 21 positive cases and the patients are all recovering,” she said. 

It may be mentioned that central teams have identified 50 districts from various states, including Telangana, to monitor measures being taken to prevent spread of Covid-19. Official sources said Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Rangareddy and Adilabad have been identified for the purpose. Since a lot of people in Adilabad listen to All India Radio, the medium is used by the collector and officials to address people every week on the rules and inform them about medical and quarantine facilities and also the relaxation of lockdown telling them what is allowed and what is not.
