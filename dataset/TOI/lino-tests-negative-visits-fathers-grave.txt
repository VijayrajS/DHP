KOTTAYAM: Finally, there’s some relief for Lino Abel, who was confined to the isolation room in the medical college hospital and was unable to attend the funeral of his father. The test result of his sample for Covid-19 came as negative and he was discharged from hospital on Saturday. 

The 29-year-old youth had to go through the ordeal of watching the body of his father being carried away in an ambulance from the window of his isolation room. 

“I got the results on Saturday morning and was discharged by noon,” said Abel. The youngster went straight to St Mary’s Church in Kalayanthani, where his father Abel Ouseph was laid to rest.

 Abel, who reached Kerala from Qatar to meet his father who was critically ill, chose to get admitted after he had some doubts about his health.

Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan saaid in a tweet, “Heard about Lino Abel, who couldn’t attend the funeral of his dear father Abel Ouseph, as he chose to stay in isolation ward for suspected Covid-19 infection. I share Lino’s grief and appreciate his sacrifice for the people of Kerala”. On Friday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had praised the youth for his social responsibility.

After getting the results, Abel wrote on his FB page: “I don’t know whether I am happy or sad. I have been staying in the isolation ward for six days. Here, I was looked after very well. Even the woman who comes to clean the room used to speak in a very positive way.” He also wrote that he won’t forget the Room No 205 where he stayed. He also thanked the doctors, nurses who treated him like a brother and a son.
