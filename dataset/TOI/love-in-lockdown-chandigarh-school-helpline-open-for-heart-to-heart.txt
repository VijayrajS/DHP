2020-05-01
CHANDIGARH: Dying for a free chat with girlfriend or boyfriend, locked down school students have made the NCERT helpline their new loveguru for the period of coronavirus pandemic.


Counsellor Neeru Attri, voice on this telephone line in the Chandigarh region, said: "Teenagers call up for free advice on how to have a heart-to-heart with love interest when the entire family is at home and even opening up to regular friends on the phone is difficult. Their main relationship issues are of misinterpretation and miscommunication. There is lot of misunderstanding, sadness, and irritability in new-age relationships.‚Äù

 Of course, some of the callers from Class XII also share their worries about pending examinations. They don't know how long to keep preparing because the focus and stress of it is breaking them down. In normal circumstances, the tests and stress are over by this time. The next big question is about discipline.

Attri said: "Away from school, glued to television or mobile screen all night, busy on the social media without purpose, and then late to get up in the morning, the students feel lethargic all day and don't have their focus on studies."
