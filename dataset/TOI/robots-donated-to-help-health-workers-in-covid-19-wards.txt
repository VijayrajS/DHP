TRICHY: Sastra University in Thanjavur has donated two more advanced robots to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy to aid frontline health workers at the Covid-19 isolation wards.


Officials from Sastra University handed over the two Zafi Go robots to Trichy collector S Sivarasu in the presence of dean Dr K Vanitha here on Monday. Designed by New Propeller Technologies of Trichy, an incubatee of Sastra University, Zafi Go was meant for carrying food, medicines and clothes to Covid-19 patients in the isolation wards at MGMGH.

Aimed at reducing the contact between health workers and patients, the 4.5ft robots 4.5 foot were equipped with the capacity to carry 15kg. The robot can be loaded with the things to serve 10 patients to 15 patients at one go. The battery backup will last for four hours.

“Zafi Go is different from our previous two models in terms of features. Changes have been made to suit the specific needs of the health workers in the isolation ward,” said the chief executive officer (CEO) S Mohammed Ashik Rahman on Monday. Zafi and Zafi Medic released by the company nearly a month back had actually been designed for educational purpose. They had tweaked them to fit the bill at the isolation ward. One robot had already been donated by New Propeller Technologies to MGMGH.

Zafi Go had some more advancements compared to the previous models. It can be operated through remote control from a distance of 1,500 metres (1.5 km) distance. Medical superintendent of MGMGH Dr R Yeganathan expressed satisfaction over the use of robots in treating Covid-19 patients. “We have three robots to reduce the close contact of the health workers with the patients,” he said.
