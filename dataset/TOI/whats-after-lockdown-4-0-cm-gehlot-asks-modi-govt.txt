What’s after lockdown 4.0, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot asks Modi govt
2020-05-27
JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has demanded the Modi government to disclose the Centre’s course of action after lockdown 4.0. 

“The nation is waiting to know, Govt’s further course of action as lockdown 4.0 nears its end,” said the chief minister in a series of tweets, quoting Rahul Gandhi’s press conference on Tuesday.

The fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown announced by the Centre will end on May 31.

Pointing that the nationwide lockdown has “failed” to control the virus at a virtual press conference, Rahul Gandhi said, “What is the Central government’s plan to go forward as the disease is growing exponentially in the country? The four stages of lockdown have not given the result that the Prime Minister expected”.

"What is the strategy regarding opening India? What precautions will they take to now curb the disease? How will they support migrants? How will they support the state governments and MSMEs?" Gandhi said. Joining the issue raised by Gandhi, chief minister Gehlot added, “It’s important to know what relief Govt plans to give to people. As Rahul ji suggested, cash transfer to nation’s population worst affected by lockdown shd be the first step & most urgent one. Poor, migrant workers, small businessmen, farmers are waiting.”

On Rahul Gandhi’s call to the Centre to announce cash transfers to the poor, migrants and MSMEs, the chief minister said, “What’s needed is, which #RahulGandhi ji highlighted, to restore the confidence of the poor, migrant workers, farmers as they are the backbone of our economy.”
