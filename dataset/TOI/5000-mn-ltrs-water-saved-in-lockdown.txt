2020-05-12
LUCKNOW: The 47-day lockdown has saved drinking water equivalent to a week’s supply to all 5.48 lakh households in the city. The estimate comes from Jal Sansthan officials and experts.

Around 5,000 million litres of water have been saved in the city since the lockdown was imposed. Closure of construction activities, restaurants, hotels and vehicles service centres among other activities, had caused the dip in consumption.

Jal Sansthan supplies around 700 million litres per day (MLD) of drinking water to all houses in the city. In addition, it supplies 50 MLD to around 4,500 commercial units. 

Further, an estimated 60 MLD water is withdrawn independently by thousands of small commercial units through submersible pumps. 

As a result, 110 million litres water is being saved daily, said officers. 

Jal Sansthan general manager SK Verma said, “Complaints related to erratic and low pressure water supply have come down during the period.”
