HYDERABAD: The poultry industry in the state has been hit hard amid rumours that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted through consumption of chicken, the prices of which have fallen considerably as a result. 

Since January 15, poultry industry in the state has incurred a loss of Rs 500 crore. While the chicken market has suffered a loss of around Rs 400 crore, egg traders incurred a loss of around Rs 100 crore. The numbers were released by Indian Poultry Equipment Manufacturers Association (IPEMA) on Tuesday. The Telangana Poultry Federation (TPF) said that losses have exceeded Rs 600 crore. As on date, the price of skinless chicken stands at Rs 100 per kg. The prices went down in February first week. “Even when there were no rumours about coronavirus, the average chicken price ranged from Rs 180 to Rs 200. In February last week, the price dropped to Rs 70 per kg. People in poultry business said they are selling live birds (broiler) for Rs 14 per kg.

“We are selling live birds for Rs 14 per kg, there are no takers due to the rumours about the link between coronavirus and chicken and egg consumption being spread on Facebook and WhatsApp,” said Errabelli Pradeep Rao, president, TPF.

Chakradhar Rao of IPEMA said that losses are only mounting. “I am not sure when the business will be back on track,” said.

When TOI contacted chicken retail stores, they said that people are giving chicken and eggs a miss due to doubts. 

Meanwhile, several associations are planning to organise chicken melas. “We organised meals to bust myths, but things haven’t changed, but we want to leave no stone unturned,” said Pradeep Rao.
