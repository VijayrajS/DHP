2020-05-16
Ponda: Worried that they may have contracted Covid-19, staff at a roadside eatery have demanded that they be tested for the virus as well. 

Three operators of the dhaba where the Gujarat truckdriver who tested positive for Covid-19 had his meals, have already been tested and quarantined.

The remaining staff, who claim they were present when the patient visited, were expecting health authorities to check up on them at least on Friday— two days after they came in contact with the patient. They have not been tested yet. Two employees of a transport company who came in direct contact with the patient were also tested and quarantined on Thursday. 

On Wednesday morning, the truck driver was shifted to the Ponda sub district hospital after he developed fever and other symptoms. His TrueNet Screening test and RT-PCR test, both confirmed he had the virus. 

The dhaba and the patient’s truck were sanitised on Thursday.
