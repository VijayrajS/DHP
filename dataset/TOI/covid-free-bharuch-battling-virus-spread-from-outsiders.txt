Surat: After becoming Covid free with discharge of all the 27 Covid-19 patients from Jayaben Modi hospital two days ago, Bharuch administration is once again battling the spread of virus following influx into the district.Shakir Shabbir, 18, a resident of Masjid Faliya in Vad village of Bharuch’s Jambusar taluka tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday at the Chidra village primary health centre (PHC). He had returned from Surat two days ago.Health officials said the youth had gone to visit his relatives in Surat in March. Due to the lockdown and suspension of transportation, he was stranded in Surat. After the GSRTC buses services resumed, the youth managed to travel from Surat to Jambusar on Thursday.Dr Nilesh Patel, Epidemic Medical Officer (EMO) said, “Since the youth returned from Surat, our health teams took his sample for testing. On Saturday, his report came positive. It is believed that he may have come in contact with positive person in Surat.”Immediately after the boy tested positive, the Bharuch administration declared Vad village in Jambusar as containment zone and the boundaries of about dozen of villages in the core area were sealed. The health teams have been deputed in Vad village for door-to-door survey of the villagers.Two days ago, the Bharuch administration had heaved a sigh of relief when the last three Covid-19 patients were discharged from the Jayaben Modi hospital.“People coming into the district from outside are the possible carriers of the virus. However, I had ordered all the PHCs and CHCs in the district to increasing testing facility, especially of those who have visited from other districts,” said Dr M D Modiya, district collector, Bharuch.
