Virtual contact between estranged parents, kids during pandemic: HC
2020-06-03
Jaipur: In a child custody case, Rajasthan High Court has directed that considering the pandemic, physical contact of estranged parents with the kid be substituted with ‘electronic contact’. The court said the medium of the ‘electronic contact’ will be mutually agreed upon by both parties. The single bench of Justice S P Sharma was hearing a petition by the mother, challenging the extension of time given to the husband’s family by the family court in Alwar. Shalini Sheoran, counsel for the petitioner said, Meena (name changed) and Manohar Singh (name changed ), both suffering from cerebral palsy, got married in 2009. It was an inter-caste marriage. But the marriage was short-lived as the woman was allegedly subjected to harassment by her husband’s family, leading to a police complaint. Meena returned to her family within a year while she was pregnant. She gave birth to a boy who is now nine years old. The woman filed for divorce which is still pending in the family court and the family court had ordered the custody of the child in favour of the mother. Then, a fight began over the father’s right to meet the child. The family court, in its order on June 14, 2018, enhanced the visiting time from half an hour on Sundays to three hours and allowed the husband’s family members also to meet the child. The court also directed for videography of the meeting and place of meeting at a public place with CCTV cameras. The mother was also made accountable for the behaviour of the child. Counsel said sometimes, the child got very irritated by the court-mandated meetings and this has been attributed to the mother. The mother challenged this in the court, challenging the family court direction.
