Hyderabad: Registrars of Companies (ROCs) of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have issued directions to companies to report compliance using CAR (company affirmation of readiness) on Covid-19 from March 23. All companies are expected and strongly advised to put in place immediate plans to implement work from home (WFH) as a temporary measure till March 31. 

“Companies should fill it on March 23 and report the compliance,” secretary, ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), Injeti Srinivas, said in a communication to all companies and Confederation of Indian Industries. 

He further said said: “To deal with the current public health situation, the corporate sector will be required to play a crucial role in social distancing.”

MCA has relaxed rules in respect of board meetings and dispenses with the necessity of holding physical meetings on matters relating to approval of financial statement, board report and restructuring up to June, ROCs said.

Companies and limited liability partnership (LLP) firms are expected and strongly advised to put in place an immediate plan for WFH till March 31. After that, the situation would be reviewed by the appropriate authorities. All the companies have also been asked to implement WFH in headquarters to the maximum extent possible. “Meetings should be conducted through video conferences, electronic or telephonic modes and computerised means,” ROCs said.

MCA is in the process of developing and deploying a simple web form for companies and LLP firms to confirm their readiness to deal with Covid threat. It also advised all possible measures to prevent spread of coronavirus.
