Margao: Ahead of the launch of the OPDs at the South Goa district hospital, a swab sample collection facility and testing centre have been set up at the new premises, operations of which were kicked off late Sunday evening.

Speaking to TOI, deputy director, health services, Ira Almeida, who was personally monitoring the arrangements being done to operationalise the OPDs at the new hospital said that the setting up the testing center will mean both the swab collection and testing will be done at the same premises.

 “Earlier, the swab samples would be taken at the Hospicio and sent to the Chicalim hospital for testing. Now both collection and testing of samples will be done at the new district hospital,” she said. 

Poor internet connectivity at the new hospital, however, caused some problems with the smooth functioning of some internet-based digital systems. 

“The digital token system for the OPDs couldn’t be tested today as there were some issues concerning the internet connectivity. If the problem persists, we may have to start with the manual token system,” Almeida said. 

Stating that the digital token system has an inbuilt capping on the number of patients to be seen at each OPD, Almeida said that the system has been designed to facilitate careful and elaborate examination of each patient while also ensuring the safety of the examining doctor. 

“The capping has been fixed so that there’s no chance of making any mistake with regards to Covid-19 infection control. This will enable the doctor to examine the patient in a very elaborate and careful manner. Each department will have its own capping for its OPD,” Almeida said.
