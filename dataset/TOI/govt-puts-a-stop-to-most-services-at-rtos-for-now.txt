The suspended services include issuance of learner’s licences, public service vehicle badges and conductor licence. For transfer of ownership of a vehicle, a box has been installed outside RTOs, where documents can be deposited and the new registration certificate will be mailed home. Also, driving tests and issuance of permanent driving licenses is being carried out only for those whose learner’s license or permanent license is on the verge of getting expired.

The south zone RTO, located at Sarai Kale Khan, is one of the busiest in the city and usually sees a footfall of around 1,200 a day. On Saturday, with the new measures in place, the number came down to around 150.

“Most of the busy RTOs usually cater to more than 1,000 applicants a day but due to these new measures, the number has come down drastically. We are also ensuring that applicants keep a distance of one metre between them while waiting or queuing up outside counters,” said Nand Gopal, motor licensing officer, south zone. “Before opening the RTO, we are thoroughly sanitizing it. Personnel at the entry gate are giving out hand sanitizer, which all applicants have to rub on their hands before entering the office,” he said.

Gopal said that just 70 tests were conduted on Saturday compared with 250 usually.

Another work that is going on at Delhi’s RTOs are the registration of BS-IV vehicles as BS-IV vehicles can’t be sold or registered after April 1 as per a Supreme Court ruling.
