Lucknow: Finally, there was some good news on the corona battlefront in Lucknow with a record 79 Covid-19 patients — highest in a single day so far — recovering and being discharged on Tuesday. 

Even more uplifting was the fact that the state capital now has more recovered Covid-19 patients than those undergoing treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

The leap in recovery figures on Tuesday took the total cured in Lucknow to 161, double of 80 still being treated in various hospitals.

Of the 79 recovered patients, 33 were under treatment at Era’s Lucknow Medical College, 44 at Integral Institute of Medical Sciences and two at King George’s Medical University.

Besides, as many as 45 discharged were from other districts and states even though they were counted in city’s list. They include 25 from Delhi, six each from Saharanpur and Jaipur and one each from Andaman, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh among others.

The others who recovered belong to Lucknow, including 25 from Sadar, one each from Khargapur and Sarfarazganj and rest from other parts of the state capital.

The staff nurse of a private hospital on Faizabad road was among those cured.

The city residents were sent home in ambulance with advice to self isolate for 14 more days, while outsiders will remain in quarantine at SRM Institute of Engineering and Medical Sciences for two more weeks, said health officers.
