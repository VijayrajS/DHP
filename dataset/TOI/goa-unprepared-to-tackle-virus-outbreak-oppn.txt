Goa unprepared to tackle virus outbreak: Oppn
2020-03-15
Panaji: Opposition leader Digambar Kamat has accused the BJP-led state government of being unprepared to handle the threat posed by Covid-19 and prevent an outbreak of the disease in Goa.

“The preparedness of the state government was clear from the fact that coughing and sneezing continued during the chief minister Pramod Sawant’s media briefing,” Kamat said. He was reacting to Sawant’s announcement of a slew of measures, including closure of schools and casinos, to prevent a potential outbreak of the virus in the state.

Former revenue minister and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte meanwhile blamed Sawant’s indecisiveness for delay in execution of necessary preventive measures. Both Kamat and Khaunte suggested that the state needs “speedy proactive preventive measures” to ensure that coronavirus does not enter the state.

“These preventive measures should have been implemented earlier. Off-shore casinos are breeding grounds for the virus and should have been closed,” Khaunte said.

The opposition also said the recent measures taken by the administration to curb the spread of the virus appeared contradictory and lacked scientific logic. “On one hand, the government announces closure of schools and on the other hand, allows exams to continue. They’ve decided to ban closed-door meetings and events and shut pubs and clubs, but allow malls to remain open,” said Kamat. He also questioned Sawant’s move of leaving the fate of Shigmo parades in the hands of local organising committees. 

On the ban announced on campaign meetings for the upcoming zilla elections, Kamat said, “This is a clear indication of growing support for opposition candidates. Hence, the government is trying to create fear in the minds of the public to restrict large voter turnout.”
