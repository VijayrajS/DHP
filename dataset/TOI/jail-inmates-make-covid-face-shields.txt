Lucknow: After pitching in to join the nation’s fight against novel coronavirus by making masks and personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, the UP prisons department is now planning to manufacture face shields. Hamirpur district jail is leading the initiative.

Till now, prison inmates have been roped in to manufacture over 16 lakh face masks, 1,000 PPE kits, several thousand litres of sanitizer and sanitizing tunnels.

Director general (prisons) Anand Kumar said, “Face shields prepared by inmates of the Hamirpur district jail will be of great help to us. Now, we can give these face shields to visitors and prisoners brought from outside and lodged in quarantine barrack,” Kumar said.
