Self-generate your power bill in lockdown
2020-05-20
LUCKNOW: With hand held billing suspended during the lockdown, the energy department on Tuesday pitched for trust billing, that is, self-generation of electricity bill.

Power minister Shrikant Sharma said UPPCL has been receiving complaints that consumers are not getting bills because of the lockdown. “The problem needs to be addressed swiftly,” he said. For this, he said, the only solution would be trust billing wherein a consumer could generate electricity bill by logging on to UP energy department website www.upenergy.in. 

Under the process, a consumer has to create an ID and generate bill. The facility will be applicable for consumer having a load up to 9 Kilo Watt. Sharma also emphasised on constitution of a helpdesk at the billing counters.

Sharma said the department was also receiving complaints of consumers not being given electricity connections under Saubhagya scheme. Also, many applications under Jhatpat connection and Nivesh Mitr portal are pending. Sharma directed UPPCL chairman Arvind Kumar to get the applications disposed of under a set of guidelines.
