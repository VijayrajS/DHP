Hyderabad: Telangana police have issued an advisory asking people to be cautious of emails that come in the name of World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with information on Covid-19 as cyber criminals could steal sensitive information by installing spyware. 

On Thursday, the ministry of home affairs issued an advisory asking people to be wary of frauds in the name of coronavirus. “Some cyber fraudsters are circulating a malware link ‘corona live 1.1’ which, when opened, steals confidential data from the receiver’s phone or computer. Sometimes, cyber criminals are also taking advantage of rising conronavirus concerns for collecting charity,” the advisory warned.

Police on Friday advised people to be wary of emails that come from CDC and WHO. Emails that come from adresses like CDC-covid19@cdc.gov will have an attachment of safety precautions. “Do not click on the attachment. If you click on the attachment, the information on your phone or computer will go to the fraudster,” police advised. 

As per the advisory, ‘corona live 1.1’ is a spyware. “So far, no complaints have been received. But, cybercrime police are getting phone calls from people who received such emails. They have been advised to not open any attachments or click on link in such mails or SMSes,” DSP Srinath Reddy said.
