Pune: A woman constable on bandobast duty in the eastern part of the city tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday as did a State Reserve Police Force jawan also on bandobast duty in central Pune on Thursday.

The woman, currently with the state Criminal Investigation Department, was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday after she developed a cough and temperature, both symptoms of the contagion.

The state CID has released its manpower to local police units to help in bandobast duty on the roads and in red zone areas of the city.

After the SRPF jawan tested positive for Covid-19, the entire company of 25 policemen deployed in the area has been sent to the quarantine facility in the city, a senior police officer. 

As many as 10 police constables have tested positive for the contagion so far. Nine were from a centrally located police station. 

This is the first case among the policemen posted in the suburban area of the city. As many as 96 policemen have already been sent to institutional or home quarantine.

Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Suhas Bawache said the police are taking steps to prevent spread of the infection among the policemen. The police station was sanitised on Thursday.
