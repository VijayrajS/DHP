2020-03-29
PANAJI: BJP legislators have urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to allow the state to re-implement a total lockdown in Goa.


In a letter, MLAs informed the PM and home minister that without a total lockdown, people will crowd in large numbers at shops and social distancing norms will not be adhered to. They also pointed out that the vehicular movement has to be completely stopped.

The state has 27 BJP MLAs, including chief minister Pramod Sawant. On March 24, Sawant had announced a total lockdown in Goa. It was relaxed on March 26 in keeping with the Centre’s directives on provision of essentials.

After the announcement of a nationwide lockdown for 21 days on March 24, all the legislators were looking forward to implement the same in the state.

“We feel that the purpose of lockdown will be futile if shops are kept open. People resort to panic-buying and show least concern for social distancing. Recently, crowds were visible near milk booths and grocery shops,” MLAs said.

“Goa being a touristic state, spread of the epidemic would have a long lasting impact on the economy and livelihood of the people too,” MLAs maintained.

MLAs stated in the letter that it was a humble request from the people not to allow any vehicular traffic, shut down all grocery shops and ensure their safety.
