2020-03-12
Salem: In a first in western Tamil Nadu, the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital has come up with its own hand sanitizer to keep its staff safe from the Coronavirus (Covid-19) spread. 

Talking to TOI, hospital dean Dr R Balajinathan said the prices of hand sanitizers have gone up in the market as there was a huge demand for the same today. “We can’t spend that much amount on sanitizers. So, I asked the head of pharmacology department to prepare vaporized sanitizer on their own.” 

Subsequently, a 10-member pharmacology department team started preparing the sanitizer. “The team prepared the sanitizer in the second week of February and after getting suggestions and feedback from other doctors, the team refined the product, which is much better than the several existing ones in the market,” the dean said. 

The key ingredients that the team used to prepare the sanitizer include isopropyl alcohol, glycerol and hydrogen peroxide. “This sanitizer will get vaporized within a few seconds of application as it contains 75 % alcohol,” said Balajinathan. 

Pointing out that the hospital requires at least 25-litre sanitizer daily for its staff, he said, “We were spending nearly Rs 30,000 a week on sanitizer. Now, we are just spending Rs 12,000 to produce the quantity required for a week.” The dean said there wasn’t any plan to market the product.
