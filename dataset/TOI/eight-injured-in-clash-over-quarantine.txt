Rajkot: Eight people were injured in a clash that erupted after one faction asked the other to stay in home quarantine as they had come from outside. The members, interestingly, belong to the same family in Bheemnath village of Barwala taluka in Botad district on Wednesday morning, said cops. “Ghanshyam Vekaria along with his three family members had come to Bheemnath village from Surat. On Wednesday morning, his cousin Uka asked him and his family members to remain under the mandatory home quarantine. This angered Vekaria, triggering off the clash,” said S Y Zala, sub-inspector with Barwala police station. “Members from both the families attacked each other with iron pipes, matchettes and bats. Five members from both the groups have been booked for the crime,” said Zala, adding that the injured were admitted to Dhandhuka Civil Hospital.
