Goa: Healthcare institutes told to watch out for coronavirus infections
2020-01-23
PANAJI: An alert has been sounded to healthcare institutes across the state against a new strain of coronavirus that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month. 

Health authorities here said they have not received any reports of people who may have either recently returned from China or were in contact with a person afflicted with the virus.

State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said people travelling to India from China will be watched for 28 days to ascertain if they show symptoms of infection. “Till date, however, there has been no such case,” he said.

Betodkar also said the only known symptoms of the new coronavirus are pneumonia and respiratory problems. 

“How the virus is transferred — whether from an animal to a human and then from one person to another — has not yet been established,” he said. 

Goa’s healthcare institutes, which include the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital at Bambolim, district hospitals and other facilities, have been instructed to take precautions against the virus. The Goa branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also been asked to alert its members about the new disease, Betodkar said. 

“It is much easier to keep things under control when we have to keep track of people who may have travelled to the place where the disease originated or came in contact with an infected person, rather than being faced with a condition in which the virus originates in a local area,” the state epidemiologist said.

He also said passengers at Indian airports that receive flights from China are being screened.

As per reports, in addition to 258 cases of the disease in Wuhan, China, over 20 have been recorded in Beijing, Shanghai, Guandong province in the south and Zheijang in the east.
