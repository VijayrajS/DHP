AGRA: Two individuals from Sri Lanka, who were also members of the Tablighi Jamaat (TJ), were arrested from a mosque in Aligarh and sent to jail for "violation of visa norms".

According to SP (crime) Arvind Kumar, the duo had come to Aligarh after attending the Markaj event in Delhi. Earlier, they were kept in quarantine inside the mosque. As they had come to India on a tourist visa, and had indulged in promoting religious activities in violation of the Foreigners Act 1946, they were booked and sent to jail.

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, city magistrate Vineet Kumar Singh said that the duo were booked along with 14 other Jamaatis, who were hiding in mosques. But, they did not take part in the Delhi event.
