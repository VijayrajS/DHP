Cops misled, find no quarantine breach
2020-03-20
Ahmedabad: AMC and police officials on Thursday followed up a tip-off that two persons supposed to be in home quarantine were moving around, only to find that both were at their homes. The two concerned persons had arrived from the USA with their families on March 14, and were supposed to be quarantined at home for 28 days. They live in the same neighbourhood. On Wednesday, authorities received calls from neighbours of the two persons that they were seen outside their homes and it posed a risk to public health. Accordingly, AMC officials went to city police chief Ashish Bhatia on Thursday morning asking him to take action.

Police immediately went to the given addresses but found both persons at their homes. “They told us that they had never stepped out of their homes, but somebody called up AMC’s health officials to give false information. The AMC health officers then counselled them on the dangers of moving about,” said a police official.

 Police officials said the task of apprehending quarantine patients moving outside home has been given to the city crime branch, which has formed teams for the purpose.
