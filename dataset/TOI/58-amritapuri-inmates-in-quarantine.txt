2020-03-25
Kollam: Alappadu panchayath authorities have complained that Amritanandamayi math authorities had kept the information on self-quarantined inmates, mostly foreigners, as secret. Panchayat member R Baby, representing the ward in which the Amritapuri ashram is located, came out with a Facebook post criticizing the math’s reluctance to pass on the information to authorities in spite of repeated efforts.

He said, based on the panchayat’s report, the district collector had asked for convening a meeting and the official representing the math had said that no health worker or panchayat authorities had visited the math and demanded any information on quarantined people. However, Baby said that they managed to take 68 inmates self-quaranined at the math to conduct a test for Covid-19.

Panchayat vice-president M B Saneev Meenath also said that the health standing committee meeting held on Tuesday decided to place around 200 natives working at the Amritapuri ashram under observation in their own houses.

Matt’s version

When contacted Amritanandamayi math authorities told TOI that the Facebook post by the panchayat member was based on a misunderstanding. Harikrishnan, media relation officer of the math, said there were 58 foreign inmates who reached the ashram since February 25. “We have been strictly following the government’s direction. The report that we did not disclose the details of self-quarantined devotees was not true. Everyday, health authorities from the Alappad panchayt came to the math and they knew that the 58 of the inmates have been quarantined,” he said.

He said the math authorities were sending a daily report to the DMO and anyone could examine the email details.
