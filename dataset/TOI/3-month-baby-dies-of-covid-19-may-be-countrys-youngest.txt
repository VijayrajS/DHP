JABALPUR: A three-month-old infant, infected with coronavirus, died in Jabalpur on Tuesday, making her perhaps the youngest victim in the country. Her test report came a day after her death.

No one else in her family is a Covid-19 patient, but she lived in a hotspot. Her family members were quarantined immediately after her report came on Wednesday night. The administration conducted the child’s last rites, said Jabalpur chief medical and health officer, Dr Manish Mishra.

The newborn was unconscious when admitted to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College and Hospital on May 4. She had high fever and exhibited symptoms of viral encephalitis, said sources. She died on May 5 and her samples were sent for Covid-19 test.

“The infant was a resident of Chandni Chowk, where several people have been found Covid-positive. She has two elder sisters, aged 7 and 10,” said the CMHO. None of them shows any symptoms of coronavirus infection but they are in quarantine and will be taken into hospital isolation on Friday.

A pregnant woman, who had died the same day as the infant, also turned out to be infected with Covid-19.

She was at the end of her first trimester when admitted to the same hospital on May 5 with respiratory distress. She died within a few hours of admission, said sources. Her test report came positive on Thursday.

Jabalpur, where the state’s first Covid-19 case was detected in March, seemed to have escaped the worst, until it was hit by an avalanche of cases towards end-April. At least 30 Covid patients are from Chandni Chowk locality, which is a containment zone. One of the first to test positive here was an elderly woman, who died before his repot came back from the lab.

Jabalpur’s death toll from Covid-19 now stands at four, and its corona count is 115.
