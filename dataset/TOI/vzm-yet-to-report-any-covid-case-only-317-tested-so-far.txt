Visakhapatnam: Only 317 Covid-19 tests have been carried out in Vizianagaram so far, of which 215 samples have tested negative and results of 102 samples are awaited, according to medical authorities of Vizianagaram district.

The districts of Vizianagaram and neighbouring Srikakulam have not recorded any Covid-19 positive cases yet. These are the only districts in Andhra Pradesh where no positive cases have been recorded so far.

According to officials, this is because of the manner in which the lockdown was imposed both in the district of Vizianagaram and across the border in Odisha.

“The manner in which the lockdown was implemented played a crucial role in restricting the spread of the virus in the district,” said Dr SV Ramani Kumari, DMHO Vizianagaram.

She added, “We have been following the guidelines to the hilt. So far, we have tested people who returned from abroad, people who have come in contact with them, those suffering from severe acute respiratory infection or influenza-like symptoms.”

“There has been no deviation from norms whatsoever,” Dr Ramani Kumar maintained. The DMHO further said that there was no room for random testing. She added that all those who have been tested in the district had either come voluntarily or were identified by neighbours and relatives.

Medical authorities clarified that they have been issuing public notices asking people to come forward and get tested.

District collector M Hari Jawaharlal said, “Apart from volunteers and health workers conducting door-to-door survey, the third phase of which ended a few days ago, we are taking all other measures to increase the sample base.”
