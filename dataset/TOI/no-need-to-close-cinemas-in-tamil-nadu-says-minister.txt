MADURAI: Information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju on Thursday said there was no need to close cinemas in Tamil Nadu, unlike in Kerala. Cinemas in Kerala have been temporarily closed as requested by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the wake some Covid-19 cases.


Responding to a question if the Tamil Nadu government was planning to request cinemas to suspend shows to prevent novel coronavirus spread, the minister told reporters in Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district that such a situation did not arise in the state. 

According to the minister, the situation is different in Kerala. “There is swine flu and other epidemics there. Nobody is infected in Tamil Nadu due to early detection and stringent measures by the government (to control Covid-19). So, there is no need to close theatres here,” Raju added. 

Replying to another question, the minister said actor Rajinikanth’s announcements need not be taken seriously as they would not affect the ruling AIADMK. “Let us see after he makes a new announcement,” the minister said. 

Raju said Rajinikanth had been meeting with his fans regularly from 1996 and the AIADMK sees Thursday’s meeting as one such routine meeting.
