2020-04-12
PUNE: The city police on Thursday booked 17 people for disobedience under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.

Those booked include 13 Tablighi Jamaat members from Ranchi and four trustees of a mosque in Ganesh Peth.

The Faraskhana police had received a telephone call, stating that Azan (call for prayer) was given at the mosque, following which a team rushed to the spot and took 17 people into custody.

“The 13 community members had visited Pune for the annual congregation, but don’t have links with the Nizamuddin event. They stayed in the mosque after the lockdown period came into force, but the trustees did not share this information with the police,” deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Swapna Gore told TOI. 

All 17 have been sent for medical examinations. “One should not be a carrier and affect others,” Gore said. 

“We have also booked them under Section 52 (1) of the Disaster Management Act,” Gore said, adding that efforts were on to collect the travel history details of the 13 people.
