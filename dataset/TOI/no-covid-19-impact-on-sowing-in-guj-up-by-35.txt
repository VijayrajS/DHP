2020-04-17
AHMEDABAD: Farming activity is apparently going full swing in times of corornavirus lockdown. Data released by the state agriculture department revealed that Gujarat has recorded a 35% rise in summer crop sowing till April 13, the highest since 2016. Here, Saurashtra has reported the highest spike of 165% in the sowing of summer crops.


Across the state, summer crop sowing took place in 8.91 lakh hectare area as compared to 6.62 lakh hectare last year.

 


In Saurashtra, the area under summer crop sowing has jumped from 86,200 hectares to 2.34 lakh hectare. 

Summer crops mainly include paddy, bajra, maize, mung, urad, groundnut, sesame, vegetables and cattle fodder. 

The sowing data has come as a heartening departure from the depressing forecasts of agriculture sector likely to suffer setback due to labour shortage.

Farmers say that lockdown has proved to be a blessing in disguise as young hands of the families who had migrated to cities mainly Surat have come back to village following the industrial shutdown. Adequate availability of water following a robust monsoon has aided the sowing. 

Lalit Mehta, a farmer from Amreli says his three sons engaged in diamond polishing work have more than made up for the agri-labour shortage. 

â€œAs there is no other work, the whole family got working in the farm and have completed sowing in 10 bighas of land with the help of locals," said Patel. 

Kishan Ghyanshyam, a farmer from Lathi said that good availability of the water in the dams. has prompted many farmers to take summer crop.

Experts say that 208 dams barring Sardar Sarovar dam have 122% more water as compared to last year while 139 dams in Saurashtra have 347% more water. 

Agriculture department officials said cash crops like sesame have recorded 200% rise in sowing while sowing of mung, udad and groundnut has doubled as compared to last year. 

Summer sowing of onion has also recorded an impressive jump of nearly 300% as 7,610 hectare land is under sowing as compared to 1,811 hectare area in 2019 but this year it is in 7610 hectares.
