Kolkata: Like almost everyone else, it’s work from home for Bengal politicians. If workers of the ruling Trinamool Congress and opposition BJP are reaching out to daily-wage earners with free food, their leaders are remotely monitoring the operations.

Trinamool workers are carrying food packets on cycle vans and distributing them among the poor in Barrackpore. Party secretary-general and minister Partha Chatterjee too visited Behala to distribute food packets. 

The state BJP headquarters is keeping track of the distribution process on a daily basis and sending reports to Delhi. The focus is on Kolkata and Howrah. According to the party’s state general secretary Sayantan Basu, workers distributed rice, pulses and potato among 87,182 families on March 30, 1,01,000 families on March 31 and 1,30,000 families on April 1. 

“Our MPs (18 LS members and two RS members), 14 MLAs and 30 state office-bearers began the effort by spending on their own. It is now being carried out by one lakh-odd BJP workers spread across 70,000 booths,” Basu said.

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh has procured 10 vans to carry food items for the poor in Kolkata and Howrah. BJP leader Mukul Roy and party MPs Arjun Singh and Nisith Adhikary are running similar camps in their own constituencies. 

Left organisations have a different approach. Paschimbanga Vigyan Mancha volunteers are holding workshops on how to make hand sanitisers with isopropyl alcohol, glycerine and clove oil. 

Left youth wing DYFI in Jadavpur has floated a platform of “red volunteers” to help senior citizens with buying medicine and food. DYFI activists in Barrackpore belt are donating blood to the central blood bank.
