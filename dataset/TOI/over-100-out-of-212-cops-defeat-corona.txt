Kolkata: Over 100 out of 212 cops defeat coronavirus
2020-06-09
KOLKATA: Around 212 Kolkata Police personnel have tested positive for Covid, but at least one in every two cops has recovered and several have rejoined work. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that frontline workers, particularly members of the organized force — police, CISF, CRPF, drivers — who are more exposed due to their jobs, have been victims. 

“I gathered from today’s Covid update that 20 policemen have contracted the virus,” the CM said. Among those who tested positive in the past 48 hours are officers from Regent Park police station. However, after many efforts, the case surge at Police Training School has been arrested. “Everyone’s health is being monitored at the unit level. There is no news of a special committee being formed for this,” said joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. 

Across the nation, MHA has said that 55 police and CAPF personnel have died, 5,828 have tested positive and another 10,781 have been quarantined. Sources said with rise in number, facilities were bolstered at Dumurjola police quarantine centre where a doctor is now constantly available. Senior officers have also hailed the perseverance of assistant sub-inspector Atul Chandra Das from Garfa police station, who managed to beat Covid despite a 70% heart blockage, and Pragati Maidan OC Chandan Roy, who completely recovered despite suffering from diabetes.

The death of a 47-year-old constable suffering from Covid two days ago, the first in Kolkata Police, put the spotlight back on the battalion barracks that have reported multiple cases and a protest. Commissioner Anuj Sharma has now ordered DCs and joint CPs to ensure voices from the battalion are heard.
