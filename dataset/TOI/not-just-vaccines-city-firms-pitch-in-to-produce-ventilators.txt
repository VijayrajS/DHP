Not just vaccines, Hyderabad firms pitch in to produce ventilators
2020-04-22
HYDERABAD: It is not just the development of Covid-19 vaccines where Hyderabad based companies are showing the way. Many medical devices, aerospace and consumer electronics companies and startups too are doing their bit by developing and manufacturing ventilators and ventilator parts.


A team headed by entrepreneur and former MP Konda Vishveswar Reddy has developed a Covid-19 specific ventilator — ICo-Vent — that has been built to Indian and UK government standards. ICo-Vent, which can be rapidly manufactured and is expected to cost Rs 50,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh, addresses the shortcomings of conventional ventilators used in ICUs for critical patients.

“ICo-Vent is specially designed for Covid-19 and ARDS patients. It allows intensive care specialists or pulmonologists to order a precise volume of air and oxygen at a precise inspiration and expiration pressure considering the elasticity of the lungs. Most other ventilators, especially those based on mechanized ambu bags, can cause ventilatorinduced lung injury and also put healthcare professionals at risk as their operation can lead to release of a huge viral load into the ICU atmosphere, something that healthare workers in other countries have succumbed to,” explained Reddy.

Recently, IIT-Hyderabad incubated Aerobiosys Innovations unveiled a low cost, battery operated, IoT enabled portable ventilator – Jeevan Lite. City-based Bhagwati Products Ltd (Micromax) plans to manufacture bag-valve mask (BVM) based ventilators, developed at T-Works and tested at NIMS Hospital, at its mobile and consumer electronics unit
