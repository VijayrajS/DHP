2020-04-22
CHENNAI: The state found an emerging cluster of cases as 26 employees of a private television channel and three of their family contacts tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. Journalists from other media houses were also called for tests by the directorate of public health. Tamil Nadu recorded 76 new cases, including 55 from Chennai, taking the total number of cases in the state to 1,596.

A 70-year-old man, who had tested positive for the virus, died at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Tuesday, taking the death toll to 18. 

“He was referred to us by a private hospital. He had severe comorbities including chronic liver failure. He could not be resuscitated,” said dean Dr R Jayanthi.

On Sunday, two journalists, one of them from the print media, tested positive for the viral infection. “We have now started tracking journalists from other organisations who attended meetings with these journalists. Family members of those tested positive are also being screened,” said health minister C Vijayabaskar. “Journalists are frontline workers who are vulnerable to the infection. Also, they are in a hotspot like Chennai. Most parts of north Chennai are congested and they have recorded a lot of cases. But with aggressive screening, hygiene protocol and social distancing, we will be able to contain the infection rate,” he said.

PMK founder-leader S Ramadoss said the government must do away with press conferences on Covid-19. “More than 200 people, including journalists, photojournalists and camerapersons of television channels, gather for a press meet. If this is avoided, journalists can be protected from the infection,” he said. The government must issue press releases along with video footages, and media organisations should follow social distancing at work, he said. A bulletin from the state health department said 5,458 people have been tested for the viral infection on Tuesday, taking the total number of people screened to 47,168. 

The state has ramped up testing across all sections, Vijayabaskar said. “We are testing all people with flu-like symptoms, contacts of all people who had tested positive and patients admitted to hospitals with severe acute respiratory infection,” he said. “We have managed to keep our recovery rates high and mortality low,” he said.

On Tuesday, 178 people were discharged from various government hospitals after two consecutive tests done on them showed negative. This takes the total number of people discharged to 635.

Apart from the cluster among media professionals, two participant of the Tablighi Jamaat meeting and 26 contacts of other people from the TJ cluster tested positive on Tuesday. Also, there were three people with unidentified source of infection and 10 other contacts of those who had already tested positive. In Villupuram, a seven-month-old baby tested positive for the virus.
