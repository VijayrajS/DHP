Amaravati: Braving the Covid-19 pandemic, around two lakh volunteers village and ward volunteers across the state disbursed welfare pensions to beneficiaries on Friday.

The disbursement of pensions at home has provided a big relief to the elderly and the physically challenged during the lockdown.

Village and ward volunteers disbursed pensions to about 85 per cent people by 10 am. This is the second month the volunteers have handed over pensions to the beneficiaries during the lockdown.

“About 52 lakh beneficiaries received the pension by 3pm. This is nearly 92% of the total 58.22 lakh eligible beneficiaries,” said Gopalakrishna Dwivedi, rural development and panchayathraj principal secretary.

The state government is spending close to Rs 1,421.20 crore towards the initiative.

To prevent the virus spread, the volunteers have used photo identification method instead of biometric system and a separate app was used to capture the beneficiary picture through geo-tagging. The volunteers have taken strict measures while distributing pensions.

“This is the result of our chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s commitment to deliver all the welfare schemes at the door-steps of the poor,” said Dendulur legislator Abbaiah Chowdary.

The government has promised that the pensions would be disbursed next month if anyone could not receive it due to being stranded outside the state.
