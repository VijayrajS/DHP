Dehradun: Four staff nurses of a private hospital tested coronavirus positive on Saturday. The nurses supposedly got the infection from a pregnant woman who tested positive after her demise on May 25.

They were moved to Government Doon Medical College and Hospital (GDMCH). Dr NS Khatri, Covid-19 nodal officer at GDMCH, said, “The district surveillance team is conducting contact tracing of these patients. Subsequently, it would be decided if other staffers of the hospital are to be quarantined.” 

He further informed that eight staffers of GDMCH have tested Covid-19 positive in the past one week.
