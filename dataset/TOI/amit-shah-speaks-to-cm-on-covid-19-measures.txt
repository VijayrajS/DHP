2020-04-27
AMARAVATI: Union home minister Amit Shah called chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy over the phone on Sunday and discussed the measures to be initiated to combat the spread of coronavirus post May 3, once the lockdown is lifted. Shah assessed the issue and strategies to be followed to contain the spread of the virus.


Shah also enquired about the measures taken up by the state government after easing certain regulations in green zones since April 20. He reportedly asked the chief minister whether the state is prepared to tackle the situation if the lockdown is completely lifted. 

Shah’s call to the chief minister is significant as it comes a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to hold a discussion with chief ministers to discuss strategies to be pursued post lockdown.

According to the official spokesperson of CMO, chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy is believed to have said that Andhra Pradesh stands at the top of the table in screening Covid-19 suspects in the country. He said they are conducting 1,274 tests per million. 

He sought Shah’s intervention in bringing AP’s fishermen stranded in Gujarat. Jaganmohan Reddy explained that he has already requested Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman, the nodal minister to the state from the Union cabinet, to help the fishermen reach home.
