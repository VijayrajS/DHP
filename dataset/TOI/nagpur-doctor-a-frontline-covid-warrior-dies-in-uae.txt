Nagpur: Dr Sudhir Rambhau Washimkar, a 61-year-old MD medicine physician working in the UAE for the last ten years, passed away in Dubai on June 7. He got infected with novel coronavirus while treating patients, sources said.

Nagpur’s well-known cardiologist Dr Sunil Washimkar, who is a close relative, confirmed the news to TOI.

Dr Washimkar was an alumnus of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Nagpur. He was a 1977 batch student. After completing his MBBS and MD in GMCH, he worked in IGGMCH in Nagpur as assistant professor (medicine). 

After working in academics for more than 18 years, he shifted to UAE with his family around 11 years ago. He has worked in different hospitals there.

Since 2018, he was associated with Burjeel Royal Hosptial at Al Ain, a city in eastern region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Currently, he was in-charge of fever clinic at this hospital. As he was infected with novel coronavirus, he was shifted to Al Ain hospital, a government facility of UAE on May 13, said a close friend of Dr Washimkar.

Dr Washimkar’s condition deteriorated and he was put on ventilator. According to his doctor friends, he was having issues with renal failure too. He leaves behind his wife, a gynaecologist, a doctor son — both were living with him at Dubai — and younger son who lives in Chennai.

Dr Washimkar became the second doctor from Nagpur to die while working as a frontline Covid warrior abroad. Earlier, paediatrician Dr Rajesh Kalraiya, a Nagpurian who was working in the UK for the past 40 years, died on April 15.
