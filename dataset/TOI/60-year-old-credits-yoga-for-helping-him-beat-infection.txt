PUNE: A sixty-year-old diabetic is grateful to his doctors at Bharati Hospital for his speedy recovery from Covid-19. 

The hospitality professional, who worked in Saudi Arabia before retiring and returning to Pune 10 years ago, suffered from dizziness and exhibited symptoms of coronavirus infection. His son admitted him to Bharati Hospital here on May 23 after he tested positive for Covid-19.

The sexagenarian lives with his wife, two sons, and daughter-in-law. He claimed that yoga helped him to recover faster. "Dr Prashant Jedge and his team took good care of me. Food and medicines were given to me on time. I was told to do some yoga and PT exercises, which helped in my recovery," he said.

He was discharged from hospital on June 3.

He has diabetes, but his sugar levels are gradually stabilising. "Doctors have advised me not to eat oily food. Otherwise, I can eat whatever I like in small proportion," he said.
