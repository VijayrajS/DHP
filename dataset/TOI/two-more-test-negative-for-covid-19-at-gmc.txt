Panaji: Two persons isolated in ward 113 of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital (GMC) in Bambolim since the last two days, have tested negative for Covid-19. 

The laboratory report of the third person suspected of having the disease who was placed in isolation on Thursday evening, is awaited. 

Health minister Vishwajit Rane told reporters on Friday that two of the three quarantined in GMC have tested negative for Covid-19. “As many as 16 persons have been isolated in GMC so far. Fifteen tested negative for Covid-19, while the report of one is expected on Saturday. Goa government sent samples for testing to a laboratory in Nashik,” Rane said. 

As many as 39 persons have been home quarantined. Since January 29, there have been 95 cumulative cases under home quarantine. 

The state government has stepped up efforts after a spike in cases detected in neighbouring states. It has posted eight doctors at Dabolim International Airport and also a paramedic. 

GMC scheduled a training programme on Covid-19 for all doctors, healthcare workers and staff of the hospital during the next few days.
