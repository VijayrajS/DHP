Coriander and garlic pod not effective cure for coronavirus: Health officials
2020-02-06
MUMBAI: There is no truth in the rumour that garlic pods, corinander leaves or cow’s urine are effective against the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), said the state government's health officials on Wednesday. 


“There is no scientific basis for such rumours. The health ministry hasn’t endorsed such views,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. 

There is no specific medication to treat the novel coronavirus but Chinese doctors have reported success with off-label use of certain drugs.

Earlier, the AYUSH ministry clarified it didn’t claim “effective treatment” for the new coronavirus, which has killed 490 in China so far and affected 24,324 others; of them, 3,219 are severe. The ministry had put out an advisory suggesting “preventive management steps,” including some herbs.
