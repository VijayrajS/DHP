MEERUT: In an unusual move, administration in UP’s Baghpat district have put up posters of two persons, who contracted novel coronavirus during the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, in their bid to alert and find all those locals who came in contact with them.

“The appeal through these posters is part of the contact mapping process of Covid-19 positive patients. It has been done to ensure that everyone who has come in their contact is accounted for, and put under quarantine,” a police officer said. 

The two patients hail from Bihar and had come to the district after attending the Delhi’s religious congregation with a group.

All of them have been put under quarantine. The area where they stayed has now been sealed.

In somewhat similar move, police in Meerut’s Mawana area had spread a message with a picture of a vegetable vendor on social media platforms after he tested positive for the contagious disease. In the message, police asked everyone who had come in the vendor’s contact to come forward and get quarantined.
