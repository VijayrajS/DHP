KOLHAPUR: In view of lockdown across the country, Kolhapur residents have engaged themselves in various activities to make their home stay meaningful and fun. 

Radhika More, a 13-year-old state swimmer from the Shukrawar Peth area has engrossed herself in rope jumping while her younger sister Sanika has kept herself busy in drawing. Their father Ramesh said, “Radhika cannot go out as swimming pools are closed. Sanika’s evening drawing class has also been cancelled due to lockdown. For Radhika, it is important to maintain fitness while my little one wants to excel in drawings and paintings. The 21-day lockdown should not be an interruption in what they want to achieve.”

Many in the city have taken up different tasks to make lockdown days fruitful as well as meaningful. They are abiding by the administration’s laws by staying indoors while ensuring that they take up some or the other indoor activity to keep themselves engaged.

Rajendra Parijat, a professor of the Chhatrapati Shahu Institute of Business Education and Research (CSIBER), said, “The classes have been cancelled. Students as well as teachers should not loose momentum of learning and teaching respectively. We are using different online tools to provide teaching material to students, based on which the assignments are designed. We currently have 110 students connected. Of course, the studious or serious students respond. We even record their attendance using these tools. Slowly, students will pick up learning through these modes. They have no option as we are making their response as part of the academic evaluation.”
