Meerut: Days after three samples of suspected cases of novel coronavirus – which were sent to Lucknow for testing – tested negative, special wards have been set up in the district hospital and Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College.So far, 56 people who returned from China last month have been identified in Meerut and are being closely monitored for any symptoms.“In the backdrop of the instructions that we’ve got from the state authorities, a 10-bed ward dedicated to the suspected case of Coronavirus has been set up. We have also maintained personal kits for each patient—if required in any case,” said Dr PK Bansal, superintendent in chief, PL Sharma district hospital.An equal number of beds have also been set up in the LLRM Medical College as well. “We have set up a 10-bed ward at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College to isolate suspected cases of Coronavirus,” said Dr RC Gupta, principal LLRM Medical College.Requesting people to calm down, Bansal said, “One should not panic in the backdrop of Corona virus. Rather, one should focus on keeping clean surroundings and washing their hands from time to time to prevent any infection. While there is no cure of coronavirus till now, but isolating the patient and putting them on antibiotics to prevent secondary infections is a way that will be dealt with currently.”Notably, death toll in China has sharply risen to 722, while the total number of confirmed cases has jumped to 34,546.
