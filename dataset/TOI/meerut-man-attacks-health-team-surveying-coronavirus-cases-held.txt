MEERUT: A man was arrested for attacking the health team which was conducting a survey to check Covid-19 cases in Karim Nagar on Monday. The area falls under Nauchandi police station, which has reported the maximum cases.


One of the locals allegedly held the team hostage, snatched the survey papers from them and ran away. He was later traced with the help of CCTV footage video and arrested by the police.

Dr Vishwas Chaudhary, Meerut district surveillance officer, said, “On Monday, 382 teams had gone for a door-to-door survey to check if anyone has a foreign travel history or is having Covid-19 like symptoms. However, when our teams went to Karim Nagar, some locals misbehaved with them.”

“I was conducting the survey in Karimnagar Lane number four, when a man came and started questioning me whether I had permission to do the survey. When I told him that I have the supporting documents to conduct active case findings, he held my hands from behind and told me that he would take me to the counsellor of the area. When I resisted, he snatched my papers and ran from the spot,” said an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), on the condition of anonymity, who had gone for the survey.

Ashutosh Kumar, station house officer, said, “The accused, who has been identified as Sohail, has been booked under IPC sections 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (whoever voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty) and 379 (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code and sent to jail.”
