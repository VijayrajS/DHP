HYDERABAD: Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday said he will have no option but to give shoot-at-sight orders if people don't stay indoors during the lockdown period. Talking to reporters on Tuesday, he also threatened a 24-hour curfew if people violate lockdown orders. 


 "Don't create a situation where government is left with no option but to give shoot-at-sight orders to the police," he said. Upset with the way people came out on streets on Monday and Tuesday, he said he may consider asking the Army to take over, besides shut down petrol pumps to keep people off the roads, he said. "Curfew would be implemented from 7 pm to 6am and all shops should be closed by 6 pm daily," he said.
