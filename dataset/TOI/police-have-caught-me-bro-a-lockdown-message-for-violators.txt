KOCHI: “Police caught me bro, if you go out unnecessarily, they will catch you too!”

A youth can be heard saying in a video that went viral on social media after policemen in Thrikkakara made him call 25 people on his call list to make them aware about the importance of lockdown.

The youth, who was roaming around in a street violating the lockdown, was intercepted by police. They were ‘generous’ enough to make him an offer that he could not refuse, call up 25 people and tell them not to come out of their houses unnecessarily and they will let him go home.

The incident happened at Kangarappady late on Sunday. The video that went viral shows a group of policemen on duty at Kangarappady in Thrikkkara police station limits suggesting the unconventional punishment to a youth who was out on the streets violating lockdown.

According to Thrikkakara police, the video was shot by a personnel on duty at Kangarapady on Sunday night.

“People are more or less cooperating with us now. Even if somebody is out, we at first reason with them and most listen to us and return home. On Sunday night, this youth turned up and the personnel on duty made him call his friends, so as to discourage them from going out. It was an impromptu decision by them,” said a senior officer with Thrikkakara police.

In the video, one of his friends could be heard laughing and challenging that he would also break the lockdown. However, the cops intervened and said they have got his display picture and would be waiting for him if he did.

When the youth told the same to another friend, she broke into laughter and said he deserved it. Police then told the receiver to stop laughing and make the caller understand the situation. The policemen also made him tell his mother that he would be home in a while. They youth was later sent home, police said.
