Keeping in mind the return of workers, the government has been adding quarantine facilities at the panchayat level. “The 14,888 temporary medical centres in 6798 panchayats can now accommodate more than six lakh people,” government spokesperson Subroto Bagchi said.

Health minister Naba Kishore Das said in view of the migrants’ return and the need for test in quarantine centres, the government is trying to increase the testing capacity. “The empowered group of ministers, led by finance minister Niranjan Pujari, on Thursday decided to start testing in medical colleges at Balangir, Koraput and Baripada,” Das said.

“The plan is to increase the tests per day to 15,000 from the current 4500 per day in the eight testing centres,” he added. So far, the state has tested 77,150 samples. Meanwhile, a three-member central team toured some the worst affected districts on Thursday.
