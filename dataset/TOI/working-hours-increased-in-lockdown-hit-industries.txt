BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Friday relaxed the daily standard working hours for adult workers from 8 hours to 12 hours and from 48 hours to 72 hours a week to revive economic activities and augment production in the lockdown-hit industries and MSMEs. 

“The shifts of adult workers in a factory should be fixed in such a way that it should not exceed six hours and that no worker shall work for more than six hours before he has an half-an-hour interval to rest. And the working hours should not exceed 13 hours,” said an order issued by labour secretary Anu Garg. 

The order further stated that women workers shall not be allowed or required to work in a factory between 7 pm and 6 am unless specifically permitted by the state government.

Additional four hours of overtime wages per day shall be paid as prescribed under the Factories Act subject to an overtime limit of 24 hours per week, said Garg. 

The industrial houses and MSME units have been asked to adhere to various guidelines issued by the state government to contain spread of the Covid-19. 

There has been significant fall in production in large industries and MSME units since March 22. Industrial associations have requested the state government for relaxations in the working hours. “Keeping the request of industrial associations and to resume the economic activities, the state government has given relaxations in the working hours,” said information and public relations secretary Sanjay Singh.
