Virus delays Koregaon Park police station opening in Pune
2020-03-26
PUNE: The much-awaited inauguration of the Koregaon Park police station has got delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak.


The state government had allotted 20 gunthas at survey No.112/5 between lane numbers four and five at KP in August 2008.

The project gathered momentum and the construction work commenced after the German Bakery bomb blast killed 17 people and injured 64 on February 13, 2010.

The KP police station was carved out from Bundgarden police station for meeting challenges related to rapid urbanisation and a spurt in crimes. The police station is currently functioning from below the Koregaon Park bridge.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Shirish Sardeshpande told TOI, “The finishing work of the police station is over after a new contractor was appointed for expediting the project. The work of installing paver block is in the final stages. The work related to electrification, interiors and furniture has been completed.”

He said, “We planned to inaugurate the police station in 10-15 days but have put our plans on hold because of the coronavirus outbreak as no labourer wants to come and complete the pending work.”

Pramod Patki, senior inspector, Koregaon Park police station, said, “The work of constructing a garden is also in progress. We hope to complete the pending civic works at the earliest.”

The KP and the Hinjewadi police stations, now under the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate, are the only two planned facilities built in recent times.
