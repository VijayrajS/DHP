TRICHY: For 21-year-old Ananyadevi, folk art and drama have been her livelihood for the last three years. After getting rejected on job front, she was accepted by a city-based drama troop that gave wings to her aspirations.

Apart from supporting her family members, she also has to repay a loan taken for her sister’s marriage. But the lockdown, which is in place to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak, has come as a dampener.

There are many transgender artistes like Ananyadevi in Trichy and neighbouring districts who have taken up folk dance and drama performance to eke out a living. While some of them have been booked for performances during village temple festivals, a few got roles in film. But the lockdown has stalled all the programmes.

Rakshana, 38, from Manapparai of Trichy, another transgender artiste, who has trained five others in folk dance, says that it was only recently that they were gaining attention as artistes.

I have helped a few transgenders give up prostitution and become artistes. But the lockdown has robed of our livelihood, she said.

“I perform in dramas during temple festival for 6 months in a year, I teach classical dance to school children in the rest of the months. But I have lost both the opportunity because of the lockdown, said Rakshana.

Machakanni, another 23-year-old transgender artist from Madurai, said that she had drama performance scheduled in four places in Madurai and Thanjavur. But that were cancelled due to the lockdown.

She has already spent about Rs 15,000 for costume and jewellery to act as a deity. Now everything has been cancelled, she says.
