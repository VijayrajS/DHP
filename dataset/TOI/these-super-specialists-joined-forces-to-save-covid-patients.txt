Gujarat: These super-specialists joined forces to save Covid-19 patients
2020-05-09
AHMEDABAD: When the high Covid-19 death rate started alarm bells ringing in the state, it was time for a leading infectious diseases (ID) specialist to push his work boundaries. Dr Atul Patel was already reviewing condition and treatment plans of critical patients in ICUs across Covid-19 hospitals in state, and decided it was time to join hands with his government counterparts and physically step into the ground zero of war against Covid-19.

“I have paid only Rs 1,200 for my MD degree. It is time to give back to the society,” said Dr Patel who reviews critically ill patients with 35-odd resident doctors daily. He along with pulmonologists Dr Mukesh Patel and Dr Varun Patel are working at SVP Hospital. “The only things we needed were protective gears and an assured parking for our cars,” he adds. Dr Patel is part of the state’s apex medical committee to address Covid-19 crisis.

At Civil Hospital, it’s the team of Dr Tushar Patel, Dr Jigar Mehta, Dr Gopal Raval and Dr Manoj Singh that’s ensuring that fewer patients need ventilators. “We were associated with the government for the Covid-19 action plan but we decided to visit the patients. Daily, we are devoting about 2-3 hours with the critical and serious patients, reviewing their treatment and providing suggestions,” said Dr Patel.

He added that responding to their appeal, about 15 more experts of infectious diseases, critical care specialists, intensivists and pulmonologists will be joining them in a few days.

“With Covid-19 patients, it’s not just the viral infection – the existing condition, which could even be mild or dormant, also manifests itself, causing the immunity to drop. It’s possible that the patient who is healthy one day can turn critical the next,” said Dr Mehta. Dr Singh said this risk was higher in senior citizen patients.
