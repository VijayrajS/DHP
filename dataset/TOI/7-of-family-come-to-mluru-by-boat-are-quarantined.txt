Mangaluru: A man and six members of his family were booked for violating the lockdown. With restrictions being placed on coming from Kerala, and the Talapady border being sealed, a man and his family used the sea route to reach his house at Addor in Bajpe police station limits, putting the health of people at risk.

City police commissioner P S Harsha said that Yakub, 48, and six others have been booked for violating the lockdown guidelines. He said that before the lockdown, Yakoob, a resident of Addor, had gone to Talapady along with his family. However, he got stuck there due to the lockdown. In order to come back home, he took the help of Shakir, hired a boat, and sailed back to Addor.

Locals noticed them in a ration shop, and immediately alerted the police. Harsha said that Yakub and his family have been sent for medical tests, and will be quarantined in a hospital.
