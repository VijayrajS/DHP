2020-01-22
KOLKATA: The city airport authorities on Tuesday issued a fresh advisory on social media on how to tackle Novel Coronavirus and put up signs at prominent locations at the airport, asking people to self-report if they bear symptoms of the illness.

“We have put up signages at prominent locations, asking anyone coming from China, particularly having visited Wuhan City in the last two weeks and showing symptoms, like acute onset of fever, cough and shortness of breath, to report to the airport health unit,” said a senior airport official. The advisory is also directed at those travellers who had visited the affected city recently but yet to show any symptoms on arrival. According to officials, if the flyers develop the symptoms within 28 days of arrival in India, they should visit the nearest hospital, report to the state/district health authorities as well as the airport health officer concerned. “From January 18 till Tuesday, we have screened 1,045 passengers but none of them has been quarantined so far. We have, however, spoken to officials of Beleghata ID Hospital, where they have kept provision of isolation and critical care facilities,” said Kaushik Bhattacharjee, the airport director.

TOI on Tuesday reported that the Kolkata airport officials have been on their toes over a mysterious virus from China, and that they have started screening those landing in the city from China. The airport health unit has set up two “health screening counters” at the pre-immigration point, checking each and every passenger coming directly from China with thermal cameras to examine whether any of them had abnormal body temperature. Immigration officers manning the counters have also been sensitized.

Four airlines fly to three destinations in China from Kolkata. While IndiGo and China Eastern Airlines run daily flights from Guanzhou and Kunming, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon have flights from Hong Kong.
