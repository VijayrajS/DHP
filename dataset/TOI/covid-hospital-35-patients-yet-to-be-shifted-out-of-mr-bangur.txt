Covid hospital: 35 patients yet to be shifted out of MR Bangur
2020-04-08
Kolkata: With only 35-odd patients still to be shifted to other hospitals, administrative officials of MR Bangur Hospital said they were ready to operate as a full-fledged covid-19 hospital with the entire new superspeciality complex ready to take in patients infected with novel coronavirus. The old complex will also be ready to accommodate covid-19 patients in a day or two.

“In the last three days, we have shifted over 220 odd patients from the old building and have discharged more than 50 others. Now, only 26 patients in the burns unit, two children in the neonatal care unit and a few more in the critical care unit are left to be shifted. All these patients are in extremely critical condition and until we have standard relocation facilities available for them, it is difficult to shift them,” said Sisir Naskar, the hospital superintendent.

“We had a total of 32 patients in the burn unit. On Monday, we could shift six to SSKM Hospital. By late tonight, six more are likely to be shifted there, but we need to maintain extreme caution while dealing with such patients. Even a minor infection can be fatal. Hence, unless we get the beds in the burn units allotted for them, it is difficult to shift them and keep them in some other ward,” said another senior official of the hospital.

According to plastic and vascular surgeons, though burn patients are susceptible to infections, shifting them is not difficult provided the patient’s condition is stable. “Burn patients are barely put on ventilation. But if a patient is in intensive care, such patient can be shifted using a critical care ambulance,” said plastic and vascular surgeon Anupam Golash of CMRI.
