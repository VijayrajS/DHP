Udupi: The Kollur Mookambika Temple has lost revenue worth Rs 14 crore due to the lockdown, as the temple was closed for devotees. The temple has been closed for about two months now.

The temple management stated on Saturday: “As pilgrims were not allowed to visit the temple, no revenue was earned this year. March, April and May are the seasons when a large number of devotees visit here. On these months, every day, almost 30,000 people visit the temple, and most of the lodges here are full. Last year, during the month of March, April and May, the temple got Rs 13 crore, and this year we expected Rs 14 crore in revenue.”

The temple authorities have appealed to devotees who want to donate, to deposit money for seva online. They can also send money to the temple’s savings account. Devotees must provide the correct postal address, so that receipt and seva prasadam can be sent by post.
