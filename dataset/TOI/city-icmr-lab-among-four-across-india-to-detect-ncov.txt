2020-01-29
HYDERABAD: The Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday announced that testing for the dreaded Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV) will begin at the ICMR lab in Hyderabad and at three other places in the country. In fact, several suspected cases of the virus which has now spread to at least six countries, have been reported in Hyderabad city.


The samples are being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. In a bid to cut out the time and hassle of transporting the samples (likely to have the highly contagious virus) the decision has been taken. The ICMR lab in Hyderabad, located in the Gandhi Medical College at Secunderabad, is biosafety level four lab which is the highest level and at par with the NIV lab.

ICMR has 10 labs in the country. The labs are only used for research and are not used for testing samples even in case of outbreaks. “The plan is to prepare it in 7-10 days for testing of samples. Since many suspected cases are being reported, the sample load is expected to increase,” said Dr K Shankar, director Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM), Meanwhile, Hyderabad has a Biosafety Level 2 lab at the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) where tests for Swine flu are currently done but the lab is not prepared as yet to do tests for more contagious viruses. It is currently stuck in an upgradation process.
