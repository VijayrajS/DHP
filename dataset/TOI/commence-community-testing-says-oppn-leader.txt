Panaji: Opposition leader Digambar Kamat on Wednesday urged the government to release a detailed report on the spread of the novel coronavirus in Goa and the steps being taken by the directorate of health to combat the pandemic.

Kamat said that a white paper report on the covid-19 situation would help dispel the rumours circulating in the state.

“The government must release a white paper on Covid-19 and maintain complete transparency in corona testing protocol. We have always asked for community testing in the state and if this is done then a lot of issues can be sorted out,” said the Congress MLA.

The former chief minister urged the government to consult healthcare experts to draft a strategy on herd immunity for Goa. “Expedite community testing and explore expert opinion on herd immunity with social awareness,” said Kamat.

Reacting to the detection of Covid-19 cases in Mangor hill, Kamat said the cases detected could be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and the government needs to step up preventive measures.

Meanwhile, the Congress’ media convenor for Goa, Trajano Dmello said that CM Pramod Sawant remains in denial about community transmission in Goa. Sawant said that the cases in Mangor, Vasco did not amount to community transmission but was a case of local transmission.

Given that one of the persons detected positive had come in contact with fish trucks coming from Karnataka, the Congress said that the border staff should be screened.

“SSC students who answered at the Mangor center should be screened along with all staff involved,” said Dmello.
