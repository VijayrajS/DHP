Aurangabad: Jama Masjid near Town Hall, one of the prominent mosques in the city, has been turned into a quarantine centre with 125 beds, food and sanitisers for Covid-19 patients. 

Jama Masjid is the first mosque to have been converted into a quarantine facility in the city, which has been witnessing a rising number of coronavirus cases. The mosque is spread over seven acres and is said to be built in 1612 AD.

Following instructions from municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, city engineer Sakharam Panzade selected Jama Masjid and Maulana Azad Women’s College in Navkhanda to be developed as quarantine facilities. 

Mosque committee members Abdul Jabbar, Mohammed Rizwan and others lent full support to the civic body’s move and promised all cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic in the city. 

The civic deputy engineer, building inspector Syed Jamsheed and ward officer Sanjay Jakkal have been appointed to look after the two facilities and ensure that all the necessary equipment is in place. 

The Maulana Azad Women’s College has 120-130 beds and has already been made operational for Covid-19 management. Civic health officer Nita Padalkar said that the AMC has already opened covid care centres at Qile Ark, Padampura, MIT College and MGM Sports Complex, where asymptomatic positive patients are being kept.

“These centres can accommodate more patients. However, if may space is required, other centres have been made ready. At Maulana Azad Women’s College in Navkhanda, we are quarantining patients for 24 hours until we get the swab report,” said Padalkar.
