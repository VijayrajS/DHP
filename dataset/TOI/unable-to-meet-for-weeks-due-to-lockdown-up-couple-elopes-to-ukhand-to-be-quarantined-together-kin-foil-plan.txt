Unable to meet for weeks due to lockdown, UP couple elopes to U’khand to be quarantined together, kin foil plan
2020-04-15
Rudrapur: Two enterprising lovers in UP’s Shahjahanpur — who were unable to meet for weeks due to the ongoing lockdown — came up with what they believed was an ingenious idea to be with each other — elope to a neighbouring state, get caught and then be quarantined together in one of the facilities meant to screen outsiders for Covid-19. 

The plan was partly successful — for four days the couple was quarantined in the same centre in Uttarakhand’s Khatima. But when the girl’s family filed a missing complaint with police, she was taken away on Monday and put in home quarantine while the boy is now stuck in the facility, serving the remaining part of his mandatory 14-day quarantine period. 

According to police, the couple, both adults, walked and hitchhiked from Shahjahanpur to Khatima, a distance of about 100 km, last Thursday. As expected, they were stopped at the border. 

Station house officer of Khatima, Sanjay Pathak, told TOI the two did not have a permit to cross borders so they were quarantined in separate rooms at the government Industrial Training Institute (ITI). On Monday, the cops received a call from their counterparts in Shahjahanpur. “They told us that the girl had been reported as missing by her family. A team of Shahjahanpur police then arrived in Khatima with the girl’s parents. The girl was sent home where she has been told to remain under quarantine while the man will be kept at the facility,” said Pathak. 

UP Police said it will send the girl’s samples for Covid-19 testing since she had flouted lockdown norms and come in contact with others.
