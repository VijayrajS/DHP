SURAT: The Indian Medical Association (IMA)'s Surat branch has called upon medical practitioners to come forward to fight against COVID-19. 

The association has also advised private nursing homes to continue their services with half the staff and call their employees by rotation. 

"We have issued a guideline to 3,400 IMA members in Surat and ask them to come forward to help government hospitals whenever needed. Over 50 doctors readily agreed to provide their services to government,'' Dr. Parul Vadgama, president, IMA'S Surat chapter, told TOI. 

IMA has also asked its doctors to have dialogue with patients.

"This is our responsibility and according to hippocratic oath we can not run away from our responsibilities knowingly or unknowingly. We will make special request to police commissioner and collector to allow our staff, chemists, paramedics and doctors to go if they have a letterhead certifying that they are working at our hospitals or have ID Cards. Unnecessarily they wonâ€™t not be harassed,'' said an IMA office bearer.

IMA has prepared a list of doctors who will be working in civil hospital on rotation basis for few hours at corona ward when the civil staff will be completely utilized.
