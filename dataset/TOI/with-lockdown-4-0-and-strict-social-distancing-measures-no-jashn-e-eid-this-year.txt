With lockdown 4.0 and strict social distancing measures: No Jashn-e-Eid this year
2020-05-23
Every year, there are celebrations galore in Prayagraj with power-packed iftar evenings and Eid lunches. However, celebrations this year are low-key, owing to the pandemic. City folk, who either organise these parties or attend them, tell us what are they missing the most about those gatherings.
Rehana Khan, a businesswoman and social activist from Prayagraj, says, “Every year we used to host a grand party on Eid for which all my friends and relatives were invited. It used to be a fun time. This year, keeping the situation in mind, Eid will be a low-key affair. Although I will miss meeting my friends and relatives. Eid is all about meeting and sharing but that we will have to miss out on this year.”


Two times Olympian and Indian hockey player Danish Mujtaba, who hails from Prayagraj and is working as a Sports Officer in Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited at Shakti Bhawan sharing his fondest memories of Eid, says, "Every Eid I celebrated at my parental house in Prayagraj with my family has been a memorable one. This time on Eid I will surely miss my parental house and the enjoyment we have every year because this is the only time of the year when my brothers and all cousins would meet at one place and we enjoy sevai, biryani and a lot more. Though this will not be the only time I will be missing Eid at my parent’s house, it happened many times while I was playing for my country.” He adds. “Due to the prevailing covid19 pandemic, being a responsible citizen of the country I will prefer staying back in Lucknow itself.”
