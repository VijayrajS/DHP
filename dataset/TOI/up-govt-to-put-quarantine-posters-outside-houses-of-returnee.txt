UP govt to put quarantine posters outside houses of returnees
2020-05-25
AGRA: The Uttar Pradesh government has reiterated its May 1 order directing all district administrative officials to ensure that quarantine posters are put outside the houses of all new entrants into the state, including the 23 lakh migrant workers who have returned in the past few weeks. 


Officials revealed that while many districts, including Kanpur (urban), Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar and Mainpuri had not even got the notices printed, some others, like Aligarh, Bareilly, Hapur, Chitrakoot, Ghazipur, Etah, Gonda, Mathura, Lalitpur, Varanasi and Pratapgarh, had not covered all the houses and merely completed the task for less than 40% of such households. 


An official said that special attention needs to be given to rural areas as the system in remote areas is not robust. Mainpuri DM Mahendra Bahadur Singh said that 1,500 posters have been pasted in a day and the process is on. “Around 5,000 migrant workers have returned to the district till now and all gram panchayats have been informed about it. Their homes, where they are quarantined, will
also be painted with a (+) mark for easy identification,” he said. 

“Gram Nigrani Samiti (village monitoring committee) has been given the responsibility to monitor the houses where migrant returnees have been quarantined,” said Aligarh DM CB Singh.
