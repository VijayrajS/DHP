Davanagere: The Chitradurga district administration has quarantined 36 people on Tuesday evening, including 15 Tablighis, after they were medically examined, and the public need not panic over this issue, said Chitradurga deputy commissioner Vinoth Priya R, at a press conference on Wednesday. On April 8, 15 Tablighis from Chitradurga had been to Ahmedabad in Gujarat, and attended a conference held at Chinathpur mosque, but they could not return to Chitradurga, after the event, due to the lockdown being clamped, said the DC. After the lockdown was relaxed, the 15 Tablighis came back to Chitradurga on Tuesday, after obtaining permission from the Ahmedabad district administration. While coming back from Ahmedabad, they passed through Surat, Nashik, Vijayapura and Hospet, and reached Chitradurga in a private bus. They were stopped at a checkpost near Chitradurga, the DC said. Their throat swab samples were collected, immediately after their arrival, for testing, and they were sent for a medical examination, the DC said. Interestingly, the DC said that four of the Tablighis got Covid-19 when they were in Gujarat, but they got cured, and posses certificates issued by the health authorities in Gujarat, stating the same. However, we still sent the throat swabs of all the 15 Tablighis for testing, as a safety measure, the DC said. 

In addition, 21 tourists from Rajasthan were also quarantined in Chitradurga on Wednesday, when a vehicle carrying them was stopped at a checkpost near Chitradurga town, as they did not have valid passes. Passes have however been arranged for them through the Seva Sindhu Portal, the DC said. “All shops and other commercial establishments will remain shut from 7 pm to 7 am, except for those dealing in essential goods, in Chitradurga district,” said superintendent of police G Radhika
