2020-03-18
New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi had a telephone conversation on Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and discussed the global situation regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders agreed that a Saarc-like video conference among G20 countries would be useful in the fight against coronavirus. 

According to MEA, Modi emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to adequately address this global challenge, which has impacted not only the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of people but also threatens to affect the economy in many parts of the world. 

The government said the PM mentioned India's recent initiative to organise a video conference among Saarc countries. The two leaders agreed that a similar exercise at the level of G20 leaders, under the aegis of Saudi Arabia as the chair of G20, would be useful, both for discussing specific measures to address the challenges posed by the outbreak of Covid-19 and also to instil confidence in people.
