PALAKKAD/THRISSUR: The health department, on Monday, issued an emergency health warning directing returnees from 12 Covid-19-affected countries to report to district medical officer of their respective districts since the World Health Organisation has declared a health emergency due to its spread in 63 countries with death toll on the rise across the globe.


Palakad DMO Dr K P Reetha has sought help from the public to inform the health department authorities on any information they get about people who had returned from these countries.

Palakad DMO Dr K P Reetha said those returning from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran and Italy should report to the hospitals immediately.

She has also sought help from public to inform the health department authorities on any information they receive about people who had returned from these countries. 

The information can be passed on the health department call centres.

Meanwhile, 52 people are still under surveillance for Covid-19 in Thrissur where the first positive case of coronavirus infection was reported. Thrissur district medical officer (DMO) Dr K J Reena said six of them are symptomatic and are in hospital surveillance. 

“We have stepped up surveillance measures. All the primary health centre staff and Asha workers have been asked to report if they find people who have returned from the virus-hit areas,” she said.
