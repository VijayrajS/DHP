Bhubaneswar: The state government has quarantined Centre’s intelligence bureau (IB) office in Bhubaneswar after one of the bureau employees came in contact with a Covid-19 patient in Suryanagar area here a few days ago. Apart from asking all the IB employees to stay in home quarantine for 14 days, the government has declared their residential colony on Bidyut Marg as a restricted zone. 

“We immediately quarantined the IB office and its residential colony on Bidyut Marg following our contact tracing exercise, involving Covid-19 positive persons. One of the positive persons in Surya Nagar came in contact with an IB employee recently,” Bhubaneswar municipal corporation (BMC) commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary said. 

Sources said at least 55 personnel work in the IB office, a premier internal intelligence agency in the country, in Bhubaneswar. The office had been running with less number of staff in the wake of corona outbreak. Not less than 150 people live in the IB residential colony located close to the bureau office. The state government has requested the IB employees to insist their family members to stay in home isolation for 14 days.

The government has also started collecting blood and swab samples of the IB personnel and their family members for Covid test. “We are on the job of sample collection and testing. We urged everyone to not panic and cooperate with the government in containing the spread of Covid-19,” Chaudhary said. Sources said the BMC in collaboration with the Odisha fire service will soon spray disinfectant on the IB office premises and the residential colony. 

The Surya Nagar locality was sealed by the state government on April 2, a day after a 60-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19. The Surya Nagar area subsequently turned out to be a corona hotspot following detection of seven more positive cases (the 60-year-old positive man’s wife, daughter and tenants) on April 3.
