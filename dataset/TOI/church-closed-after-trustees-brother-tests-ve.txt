THRISSUR: After the brother of a trustee of the Kacheri Madona Church in Thrissur tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday, the health department has directed the vicar and members of the laity that attended mass to go into quarantine.

The health department found that a trustee of the church had contacted the infected person, who works at a warehouse in Thrissur. On the direction of health officials, Fr Thomas Poopadi directed members of the laity that had attended mass at the church in the last seven days to quarantine themselves.

The church had resumed mass two days ago with only nominal participation. “The parish has 575 families but we allowed only 65 people to attend the holy mass,” said vicar Thomas Poopadi. “The trustee had attended the mass so as instructed we will follow quarantine.The church is closed,” he added. On Friday, Fr Poopadi circulated an audio clip in a WhatsApp group comprising members of the parish. In the clip, the priest conveyed the development and urged any member of the laity who had come in contact with the trustee to go into quarantine.

Meanwhile, the Archdiocesan Movement for Transparency has urged the Thrissur archdiocese to act accordingly. “In the wake of the Kacheri Madona Church incident, the Thrissur archdiocese authorities should close the churches under its jurisdiction immediately in the view of the danger posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Riju Kanjookkaran, general secretary of the movement.

“Thrissur district is already in an alarming situation and holy mass at churches will increase the threat. The Ernakulam-Angamali archdiocese has already followed the model and other dioceses must follow it,” he added.

However, Thrissur Archdiocese PRO, Fr Nyson Elanthanathu said they will not close all the churches. “The Madona Church were the case was reported is already closed and the churches under the containment zones will remain closed. But there is no need to close all churches under the archdiocese. However, we will follow all directions from the health department,” said Fr Elanthanathu.

Meanwhile, the health department has directed those who participated in the mass to go into PHC-level quarantine.
