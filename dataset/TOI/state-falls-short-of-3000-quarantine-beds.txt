JAIPUR: The state government is falling short of 3,000 more beds to meet the target of achieving 1 lakh beds for self-quarantine.


The state had earmarked a target of identifying one lakh beds with even distribution division wise for the said purpose.

The total figures were, however, achieved after 10 days of the announcement made by CM Ashok Gehlot, but several places initially identified were later dropped due to poor facilities, distance and location.

A chain of schools has offered two of their schools located in Transport Nagar. “I have offered my school buildings to Jaipur commissioner Anand Srivastave for using the manner they want. Later, I learnt that as both the buildings are located in the densely populated areas, government showed less interest,” said Jameel Khan, director of the chain of schools.

In Ajmer, they first identified Vishram Sthali in Kayad to be the Ajmer division’s biggest quarantine centre, but later it was dropped. “The place is on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway and located on the outskirts with meeting bare minimum facilities. The reason we pulled back is that it was used as a resting place for lakhs of devotees during the annual Urs. Also the place spread in acres of land was not cleaned after the conclusion of urs in early March,” said a government official.

The beds were identified by the state after exploring all possible places and zeroing in on those meeting the criteria. It has also acquired places offered by civil society members.
