2020-03-12
GANDHINAGAR: The state government on Wednesday rejected the suggestion of the opposition Congress to place malls, cinema halls, and other places of public gatherings on lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.


The government said no positive case has been reported in the state so far. During the discussion on the measures taken by the state government, Congress MLA Naushad Solanki suggested that the government shut down public places for 25 days. Deputy chief minister and health minister Nitin Patel, said: “Even in China, only five to six worst affected cities have been sealed while life is going on normally in other parts.” He went on to say: “Thus, we don’t have to create panic here at this stage. We are taking all necessary steps to contain the spread of coronavirus.”

Solanki also requested the government to start screening passengers at bus stations and railway stations. However, Patel said that at present screening of international passengers is being conducted at Ahmedabad and Surat airports in line with the Centre’s guidelines. “We are also screening foreigners staying at luxury hotels in the state,” he said.

Patel said that all 56 samples tested so far have turned out negative. He said that as a precautionary measure, 576 isolation beds and 204 ventilators have been made available at government hospitals in the state. He also said that even those coming by boats are being scanned at ports. The government has scanned 2,300 people, mostly crew members, onboard 55 ships.

Patel said that Gujaratis love to travel and are involved in businesses across the globe. “On any given day, if one travels to China one will find over 5,000 Gujarati travellers,” he said. The minister said that even if a person tests negative, his or her family is put under observation for 14 days.
