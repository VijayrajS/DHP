2020-05-02
Two Hyderabad-based sisters, Saniya and Taniya Begum have shown that age is no bar when it comes to being a Good Samaritan. Aged 9 and 7 respectively, the duo decided to break their piggy bank and use their savings of `31,000 to help feed those who are affected by the ongoing crisis. Shaik Salauddin, proud father of the two girls, tells us, “For the past four years, both my kids have been saving up pocket money given to them by me or other relatives. Recently, it was my younger daughter Taniya’s birthday, and when I asked her what she wanted, she asked me to help her and her sister to donate their savings to those suffering due to this pandemic. I was filled with pride.”

Salauddin, who is also the National General Secretary, Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers (IFAT), says they have used the money to help a few cab drivers and daily wage workers who have been affected by the ongoing lockdown. “There are so many cab drivers who lost employment because of this lockdown. I prepared a list of cab drivers, daily wage workers and senior citizens who are in dire need of help. We donated 75 grocery kits thanks to my little girls,” he says, beaming. 

Saniya Begum, the nine-year-old, who was the brains behind the initiative, adds, “It is so sad to see so many people going hungry because of this crisis. So my sister and I decided to break our piggy bank to help them. We feel happy to have helped others during such a difficult time.”
