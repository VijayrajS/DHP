Bareilly: A cop deployed at police response vehicle (PRV), along with his 15 colleagues, has been quarantined after it came to light that the person he had helped reach home by giving a lift in his four-wheeler later tested positive for Covid-19. 

The policeman is a driver of the PRV deployed in Bilari area of Moradabad. The emergency '112' vehicle has also been quarantined for the next five days and will be sanitised.

Additional superintendent of police (traffic) in Moradabad, Satish Chandra, said, "The cop is a native of Joya in neighbouring Amroha district. He is a PVR driver. On March 21, when he was on way to home in his private car, he found his neighbourâ€™s child heading towards home on foot."

Upon seeing the boy, he offered him a lift in his car. Later the boy went to Varanasi, where he was found infected with Covid-19 by the health department on April 8.

On Sunday, the policeman came to know about the development. The health department has been informing those who had come in contact with the corona positive boy. The news was enough to put the police department in shock as the driver has come in close contact at least with 15 other policemen over the past 22 days.

The health department in Moradabad carried out thermal screening of all 16 policemen and shifted them to a quarantine centre set up in Midtown Club. Besides, their samples have been sent to lab for testing.
