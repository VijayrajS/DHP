Covid-19 outbreak in West Bengal: Locals harass people with foreign travel history
2020-03-24
KOLKATA: A team of Howrah Muncipal Corporation’s health workers had to be shown a live video call to make them believe that the Shibpur resident Titas Chowdhury was still in Abu Dhabi and had not returned home. A police team had to visit the complex, Diamond City West, in Behala for the second time to convince people that one of its residents, who had returned from Europe on March 2, served out the quarantine period. Research scholar Prosenjit Majumdar, a Garia resident, took to the Kolkata Police’s Facebook page and complained that he was being hounded by local club members and neighbours, despite following all quarantine norms after returning from the UK. 


Some people, who had returned to the city from abroad much before the coronavirus outbreak, alleged harassment by locals. The residents demanded fitness certificates from ID Hospital at Beliaghata from these returnees. 

 
TimesViewThis is exactly what we need to guard against. Ill-advised vigilantism can end up causing as many problems as irresponsible behaviour by people who should be in quarantine or home isolation. 
“I am a research scholar at a UK university. I came back home four months ago — on November 25. On Sunday, I faced humiliation and life threat from one of the local club members who told me, ‘Tell us whether you had returned from London yesterday, otherwise we will pick you up from home and thrash you’. Although I repeatedly told him that I had come back long before the outbreak of coronavirus, he did not listen. Do I deserve this? Now, I and my family members are scared to step out of home. So, I request for urgent help,” he wrote on the Kolkata Police’s Facebook page.

 
Covid-19 scare in Kolkata: Techie faces locals’ wrath after return from FinlandA 30-year-old techie who had returned to Kolkata from Finland on Thursday and had kept herself in home isolation was allegedly ostracized and threatened by local residents and political leaders to leave the neighbourhood. On Friday, she inally approached the airport authorities and cops to take her to a quarantine facility in the city to get a certificate that stated her as “asymptomatic”. She then distributed a photocopy of the certificate to all her neighbours to get access to her home. 
Gautam Chowdhury, husband of Titas, said some neighbours had complained against them deliberately. “She had to make a video call to prove that she was in Abu Dhabi.” 

A resident of the Behala complex, who wished to withhold his name, had returned from Europe on March 2. “He had served his quarantine period. On Sunday, we visited the complex twice as neighbours claimed he was not following the protocol. Yet, he was still being hounded by locals after home-quarantine,” said an IPS officer from the Behala division. At Kankurgachi, MMiC (health) Atin Ghosh was shocked to find that the grudge of neighbours staying in that apartment was that an US returnee in quarantine “had dared to step on the balcony”. Ghosh had to explain that there are more than 20-metre distance between that person and his neighbours.
