BAREILLY: A 50-year-old man who was admitted at the Covid-19 isolation ward of the district hospital in Lakhimpur Kheri district died on Saturday evening. His family members, however, have refused to claim the body, forcing the district administration to take the responsibility of cremating the body.

The deceased, who was a farmer, belonged to Trikolia town in Sampoornanagar area. He was getting treatment for pneumonia at a private hospital in Bheera town and was referred to the district hospital on Friday.

“The man, along with his wife, was admitted on Friday and their swab sample was collected on Saturday morning and sent to Lucknow for Covid-19 tests. But the man’s condition deteriorated late in the afternoon and he died,” chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Manoj Agarwal said.

“He was symptomatic which is why was immediately kept in the isolation ward along with his wife,” the CMO added.

His death, however, has created panic amongst the staff and other people admitted at the isolation ward.

“There were four people at the isolation ward, including the deceased and his wife. Now, we have shifted all the three in separate wards and waiting for the test reports. Since the family has refused to accept the body, the district administration has taken the responsibility to cremate it. We are waiting for the test reports to come. We have kept the members of the family under home quarantine,” Agarwal said.

The CMO said the deceased didn’t have any travel history, but the district administration is probing whether he came in contact with any person who returned from abroad recently.
