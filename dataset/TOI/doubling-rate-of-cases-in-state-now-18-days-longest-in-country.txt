JAIPUR: The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan is now 18 days, the longest in the country. It was three to four days in the first week of April.


While the infection doubling rate in India is 12, it is 16 days in Uttar Pradesh, 12 days in Delhi and 11 days in Gujarat. “At 18 days, the doubling rate in Rajasthan is the longest. This also indicates that the curve is flattening. Hence, we will be able to manage the overall situation better by the optimal utilisation of resources,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health). Till April 23, the state had reported 1,964 cases and it doubled on May 11.




Number of discharged people surpasses active cases in Rajasthan
The effective containment of hotspots has brought fruitful results for health authorities. The areas which were reporting cases in clusters such as Ramganj and MD Road in Jaipur, Muslim Mocchi Mohalla in Ajmer, Kasai Pada in Bharatpur, Nagori Gate in Jodhpur, Chandra Ghata in Kota, Bambore Gate in Tonk and Nimbahera in Chittorgarh are now reporting only sporadic cases.

In Ramganj, the infection cases are doubling in 26 days in comparison to two-three days in the first week of April. With only 38 cases reported from May 1-10, the situation has significantly improved here. The first case was reported on March 26, when a 45-year-old person from Oman was found infected with the virus. Since then, 635 residents have tested positive.

The recovery rate in the state is also the highest in the country. “In Rajasthan, the recovery rate has increased to 58%, which means that 58 out of 100 persons have been cured of Covid-19. It is 49% in UP, 48% in MP, 33% in Gujarat, 32% in Delhi and 19% in Maharashtra,” said a health department official.

Health minister Raghu Sharma said the state’s mortality rate is just 2.83, which is even below the national mortality rate at 3.3%. He said the national recovery rate is 30%, but it is 58% in the state. The number of cured people discharged from the hospitals has surpassed the number of active Covid-19 cases in the state.
