HARIDWAR: Two members of the Tablighi Jamaat, both in their twenties, fled from an isolation ward of Gurukul Ayurvedic College in Haridwar on Monday. 

While one of them has been caught and put back in isolation, the other is still on the run. Their swab samples had been sent for testing, but the results are yet to come. So, it is not confirmed if the men are Covid-19 positive.

One of the men is a 25-year-old from Qassaban area under Jawalapur police station. He had run away once before, when police went to his home to shift him to a quarantine facility. A case had then been registered against him as well as his mother, who helped him escape, under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). After his arrest, he was shifted to the isolation ward in Haridwar, which he fled again on Monday.

This time, he was accompanied by a 20-year-old, another member of the Tablighi Jamaat quarantined at the same isolation centre as him. The latter, a resident of Gadowali village, is still absconding and couldn’t be found at his home.

Circle officer (CO) city Abhay Singh told TOI, “They (the accused) broke the lock of the back door of the isolation centre and escaped. Before escaping, one of them called up his mother and asked her to meet him at Shankar Ashram Chowk, where our team managed to reach first and shifted him back to the isolation ward. The men, however, were not present at the Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. A case is being registered against both the men under relevant sections of the IPC. We are verifying with the health department if their samples were found to be negative or not.”
