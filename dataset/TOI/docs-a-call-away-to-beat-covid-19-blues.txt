HYDERABAD: Undergoing a lot of stress or feeling depressed because of coronavirus scare? Psychiatrists are only a call away in Khammam with the district administration working out a telemedicine arrangement with them.


The district administration has also put out a list of names of psychiatrists whom the public can consult if they are feeling stressed out or depressed. ‘De-stress Corona’ provides telemedicine with help from doctors in Khammam, Palair, Wyra, Madhira and Sathupally being available on call. 

Doctors of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) have registered themselves to be part of the effort. Announcing the initiative on Friday, district collector RV Karnan urged people to make use of the hassle-free medical services while staying at home. Names, telephone numbers and timings during which the doctors will be available for consultation have been made public. 

Medical personnel with specialisation in general surgery, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, psychiatry, urology, diabetes and thyroid, dermatology, gastroenterology, pulmonology, paediatrics, obstetrician and gynaecologist, ophthalmologist, nephrology and ENT would be available. 

Two cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed so far in Khammam. 

At government hospital in Khammam, preventive and safety measures have been put in place for the staff. Collection cabins have been set up through which the personnel collect samples of suspected Covid patients from a safe distance. Such an arrangement is a first time in the state in any hospital, officials claimed.
