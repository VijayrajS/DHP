93% of coronavirus cases in past 10 days in Karnataka asymptomatic
2020-04-29
BENGALURU: Of the 205 Covid-19-positive cases added between April 17 and the morning of April 28 in Karnataka, 190 — or, 93% — have been asymptomatic and the rest showed symptoms of the infection. This puts the overall asymptomatic cases at 376 — or, 72% — of the total 520 cases so far.


In the said period, the asymptomatic cases have more than doubled from 186 to 376, while the symptomatic cases increased marginally from 129 to 144. In fact, the total number of cases jumped from 315 to 523 — a 66% increase. The assessment of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases has been conducted for 520 cases, though. Karnataka, which is projected to cross the 1,000-mark in a fortnight, wants to start random testing to track the pandemic since the spread of asymptomatic cases is widespread.

 

“While the testing capacity is expected to touch 5,000 tests a day by the first week of May, the decision to not use rapid kits may affect its ability in doing random sample tests. Since there are efficacy issues, it had to be scrapped,” one official said, referring to Karnataka scrapping its order for 2 lakh kits.


Asymptomatic cases remain a bottleneck

Experts told TOI the concern is valid. Karnataka has so far found asymptomatic cases only through tests conducted on primary and secondary contacts of positive people. There’s no accurate understanding how wide the virus spread has been.

Of the 20 districts with Covid-19 cases, six (30%) reported more than 85% asymptomatic cases, including two districts that had 94% and 95%, while only two districts reported between 25% and 35%. The rest were between 35% and 85% (see graphic).

 

Globally, too, multiple research papers have described screening of asymptomatic cases as a bottleneck while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Four days ago, researchers form University of California, in a paper they published in the New England Journal of Medicine, have said asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has made controlling the spread of the disease more difficult.

“The rapid spread of Covid-19, the clear evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic persons and the eventual need to relax current social-distancing practices argue for broadened SARS-CoV-2 testing to include asymptomatic persons in prioritised settings,” the paper accessed by TOI reads.
