New Delhi: World’s top venture capital investor Sequoia Capital has cautioned its founders across the globe that the outbreak of Covid-19 is a “black swan” event, which could lead to slowing down of internet businesses across the world and also lead to a more cautious fundraising environment. The note by Sequoia, which has some of the top startups across the world like messaging application WhatsApp and payments player Stripe, is reminiscent of its RIP Good Times note to entrepreneurs in 2008 after the financial crisis post-Lehman bankruptcy. “Some companies have seen their growth rates drop sharply between December and February. Several companies that were on track are now at risk of missing their Q1–2020 plans as the effects of the virus ripple wider……..In downturns, revenue and cash levels always fall faster than expenses,” said Sequoia in a Medium post on Thursday. Sequoia is also the top venture capital firm in India with assets under management of over $4 billion. The firm is also in the process of raising its new pool of capital for India and Southeast Asia of about $1.2-1.3 billion, as TOI reported on January 24. The firm has advised portfolio companies to extend their cash runways and to be prepared for a tougher fundraising cycle. “Private financings could soften significantly, as happened in 2001 and 2009,” said the firm. Sequoia has suggested to its portfolio companies that they start cutting down on marketing expenditure, hedge their sales forecasts as customers might being cautious and control headcount to see if they can “evaluate critically whether you can do more with less and raise productivity.”
