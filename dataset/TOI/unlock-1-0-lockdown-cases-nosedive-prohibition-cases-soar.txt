Unlock 1.0: Lockdown cases nosedive, prohibition cases soar
2020-06-06
Ahmedabad: With Unlock 1.0 cases related to lockdown have come down as expected, but the rising number of prohibition cases are more than making up for that lack. While cases of Section 188 IPC violation have come down from a daily average of 150 to around 6-7, just on Wednesday, 24 cases of prohibition were registered in 13 police stations of eastern Ahmedabad. Even in the western parts of the city, prohibition cases are growing, police said.

With home delivery the new norm, most cases of IMFL are of carriers booked while intent on doorstep delivery. Even most cases of country liquor involved small quantities. 

The highest number of prohibition cases were in Naroda police station, where five cases were registered against bootleggers. 

“Now, with lockdown lifted, bootleggers who were sitting idle for two months have suddenly become busy. Most are smuggling country liquor in small vehicles like scooters, autorickshaws and cars and some them are home delivery boys. Some manage to evade cops but most get caught and hence the figures are surging,” said special commissioner of police, crime branch, Ajay Tomar.

Tomar added that they had anticipated a surge in bootlegging with easing of lockdown and had posted extra cops to catch bootleggers.

“We have alerted our human intelligence network, kept extra staff to watch activities of listed bootleggers. We have also deployed some policemen to raid known liquor dens on a daily basis and that is the reason why more prohibition cases are being registered,” Tomar said.
