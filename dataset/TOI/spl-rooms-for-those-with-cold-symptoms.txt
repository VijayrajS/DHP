“Students can wear protective masks and even carry their water bottles into the examination hall. Further, to ensure that they keep their hands sanitized, liquid soap or hand sanitizer will be made available,” said Reddy, adding that a total of 5,34,903 students will be appearing for the SSC examinations that will be held between March 19 and April 6. She assured students that all necessary arrangements are in place for smooth conduct of examinations and they should not panic. 

 
 

The minister said that reserved invigilators will be kept at all 2,530 centers so that unwell invigilators can be relieved immediately. 

To make sure that students don’t gather in large numbers near the center, the education minister said that they will be allowed into the centre from 8.30 am to 9.30 am and added that they will be given grace time of 5 minutes. She said that students can download their hall tickets from the board’s website. 

“There is no need to take principal’s signature on the downloaded hall tickets. Students will be allowed to appear for the exam even without the signature,” said Reddy. 

Keeping the rising temperatures in mind, the education department has decided to have two medical professionals, stock basic medicines and ORS packets at each center. A special control room – 040 23230942, will be available for students and parents round the clock to resolve exam issues. The TSRTC will be plying special buses to make sure students reach the centres on time.
