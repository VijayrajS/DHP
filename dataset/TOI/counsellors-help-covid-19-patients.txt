AHMEDABAD: It’s not just the viral infection of Covid-19 itself that affects the patients. It can be anything ranging from the food to their environs in the hospital to even domestic issues on the back of their minds, said experts.

As an initiative to address these issues, a total of 18 students of social work with training in psychology have been assigned at GCRI, IKDRC and UN Mehta Heart Institute on the Civil Hospital campus by Government Hospital for Mental Health (HMH).

Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent of HMH, said that the students daily spoke to the patients, tried to understand their issues and also assess them for any signs of distress that could require medical intervention.

Arpan Nayak, coordinator for the initiative, said that social work in medical field was still a new concept and that the students were getting into the field at the most difficult times. “They wear PPEs, observe the entire hospital management and try to redress several issues that can lead to potential flare-ups,” he said.
