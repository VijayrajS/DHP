NOIDA: A two-member team from the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA) met Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh in Sector 108 on Tuesday to discuss about guesthouses and community centres in residential sectors being used as quarantine centres.


“The use of guesthouses as quarantine facilities can pose threat to the residents. The commissioner has assured that the matter will be looked into and that, for now, the quarantine tenure will be for seven days with remaining seven days of the quarantine period to be observed at home by people placed in these facilities,” said Yogendra Sharma, president, FONRWA.

On passes for movement between Delhi and Noida, the police commissioner assured that for those travelling from airports and railway stations, the tickets would act as passes.
