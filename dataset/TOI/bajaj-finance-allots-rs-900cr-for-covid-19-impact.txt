Pune: Bajaj Finance, Indiaâ€™s largest consumer durables financier, said it has set aside Rs900 crore to weather the impact of Covid-19.

After doing so, the company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs948 crore in the quarter ended March 2020 (down from Rs1,176 crore, a year ago).

The company said that it lost 10 days and about 1 million potential loans as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. The company, which typically adds about 20-25% new loans every quarter, could manage only a 3% increase in the January-March quarter. 

The quarter saw the company lose about 15 days business across the consumer durables segment, which it relies heavily on to push several products. The last few years has seen an exponential rise in debt-fuelled purchase of consumer durable products, from smart TVs to smartphones. 

For the full year, the company said that its net profit grew by 32% to Rs5,264 crore and the assets under management grew by 27% to Rs1,47,153 crore.

It said that it has a liquidity surplus of Rs15,275 crore at the end of March 2020, which it said grew to Rs20,900 crore by mid-May and that it continues to remain well capitalized among non-bank financial companies. 

It also said that in all it has set aside Rs1,954 crore in the quarter against Rs409 crore a year ago.
