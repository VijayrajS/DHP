Lack of workers to ferry essential goods a hurdle amid lockdown in Pune
2020-03-28
PUNE: The state government and district administration are working around the clock to ensure uninterrupted supply of vegetables, fruits, oils, pulses, foodgrains, but their efforts are being stymied by an unavailability of workers.


With many workers having returned to their villages, the administration is trying to reach out to them and get them to come back to work so that the essential goods are supplied on time. 

Nitin Pawar, state convener of Hamal Panchayat, said over 50,000 workers are employed in various sectors. “When the state went into lockdown, most of them returned to their villages. Now it is difficult them to return, but those who are available locally are now being pressed into service,” Pawar said.

Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram said they were working towards addressing this issue. 

Pawar further said the government too needs to consider providing insurance cover for these workers.

 “While the health workers are being covered, why not extend it to those delivering the essential services?” Pawar said, adding they have sent this demand to the government. 

“Wages too should be given properly as there are many workers who have no food or shelter. There should be a health check-up of workers ferrying essential goods,” Subhash Lomte, general secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Hamal Mapadi Mahamandal, said. 

A grocery shop in the city said it was looking to provide its own manpower to ensure loading and unloading goods at Gultekdi market.
