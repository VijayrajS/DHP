“We have two tickets to New Delhi next week, but I am not sure about travelling in the present condition. The tickets cost us over Rs 4,000 and the Railways should provide full refunds similar to airlines,” S Vishwanath, a city-based architect, told STOI. However, sources said that there are no directions issued to revoke charges on tickets that are voluntarily cancelled.

Passengers have also urged the railway authorities to install thermal screening machines and focus on cleaning the trains and stations thoroughly as there is proper machinery in place to monitor thousands of commuters travelling daily. “The government has introduced caller tunes on Covid-19 awareness and the same is being announced in all stations. But, there are no soaps in the bathrooms to wash hands,” tweeted a passenger travelling to Bengaluru.

Meanwhile, officials said that the South Central Railway (SCR) is taking adequate precautionary measures. “All railway stations and trains are being sanitised. Platforms, seats, grab rails, door rails, and windows are regularly cleaned with disinfectants,” said Ch Rakesh, senior public relations officer, SCR. “As a preventive measure, supply of woollen blankets in air-conditioned coaches has been stopped till April 15 and will only be provided based on demand by passengers,” he added.
