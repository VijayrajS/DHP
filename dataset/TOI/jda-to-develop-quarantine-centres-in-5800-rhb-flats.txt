JDA to develop quarantine centres in 5,800 RHB flats
2020-04-16
JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has started an exercise to develop quarantine centres in the district on a massive scale. Nearly 5,800 flats of Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) have been identified for the purpose on Wednesday.

RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, “The board will develop 5,800-room capacity quarantine centres to shelter the suspects. These quarantine centres will be developed in Dastakar Yojana at Naila, Agra Road and the multi-storied flats built in the village Mahala on Ajmer Road,” he said.

The civic body will develop 1,400 rooms in Dastakar Yojana in 700 houses. Similarly, 4,400 rooms in 1,500 flats will be developed in Mahala on Ajmer Road. Unlike the district administration, the JDA has adopted a different strategy to zero in on quarantine centres for the residents. The JDA is looking for buildings that have rooms to accommodate more than 300 people. The civic body is ensuring that these buildings are 20-25 km away from the city. Also, people who are sent to quarantine do not stay in one big hall.

Sources said the buildings identified by the district administration were inside the city in densely populated areas. Locals objected to these quarantine centres in the middle of dense populations. Also, no building had the facility to accommodate more than 50 people. “First priority is that building should be away from the densely populated areas,” said a source. With the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is expected to increase, the JDA identified also 20 more private buildings in Jaipur. However, officials, refrained themselves from disclosing the locations and names as owners approach government not to acquire their building for centres.

“Out of identified buildings, most are schools and colleges. After JDA identify the buildings, the acquisition letter is issued by district collector. Many apply push and pull to escape from acquisition,” said a source.
