Pregnant woman moved out of Covid ward, kin thank GMCH

Nagpur: The 30-year-old woman with ‘precious’ pregnancy was moved out of the Covid ward on Thursday morning while report of her fresh sample, taken a day before, is yet to come.

Her relatives thanked Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) doctors for honouring their request, though they have doubts about the results of the fresh test too.

NMC officials had shifted her to the Covid ward based on an assumption, though the records had wrong entries about patient details. She was assumed to be the same woman whose sample tested positive though the record showed the report belonged to a 36-year-old pregnant woman from the same area.

On May 14, TOI had reported about the woman’s plight and allegations made by her family members. The NMC health team officials had admitted that the recorded entries had mistakes not just for this woman but also in case of a couple of other pregnant women. 

The 30-year-old was taken to GMCH Covid ward after five samples taken during a special ante-natal check-up (ANC) camp at Mominpura tested positive.

Her relatives said she had gone for the ANC as a precautionary measure despite she had been left out in the drive in which her husband and her mother-in-law were quarantined. The mother-son duo were picked up following the death of the city’s second Covid casualty at IGGMCH. 

“We are praying that her latest report come negative, but it is unlikely as she was forced to spend the entire day with around 25 positive patients in the ward. We are thankful to GMCH doctors for having shifted her to another ward,” the relatives said.

NMC officials refused to admit that the woman was a case of mistaken identity despite the mistakes in entries. “Those entries were made by ayurveda doctors, for whom the process is new,” they said.
