2020-04-09
GAYA: At a time when the state government has suffered huge revenue loss on account of suspension of all economic activity, lockdown violators coughed up Rs 60 lakh in Gaya district to the dwindling public expenditure. Violators have been penalised under the amended Motor Vehicles Act.

On day one of the three weeks lockdown, no less than Rs 7.3 lakh was realised as penalty. As per official information, about Rs 2.5lakh was realised on Tuesday. Besides the gain to the exchequer, police action against the violators has also invoked the fear of law as 96 offenders have been arrested including the 10 arrests made on Tuesday. About 163 vehicles including bikes and autos have also been seized. 

From day one, Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra had ordered the SHOs and the traffic police officials to go tough with the violators. According to the SSP, besides the arrests, no less than 74 criminal cases have been instituted against the lockdown violators in the district. The SSP said that but for initial hiccups, the compliance level had been satisfactory. He has also directed the field officers to remain ever vigilant and bring the violators to book. 

Reports of misuse of exemptions have also been received. The SSP warned persons who try to take advantage of the relaxations in respect of buying of edible items and medicine. Referring to complaints that some people come out in the morning on the alibi of regular walk, the SSP made it clear that routine morning walk does not come under the relaxation purview and such violators would sternly be dealt with. “People must realise that keeping in doors was in their own interest,” said the SSP.

Asked about the pattern of general crime like burglary and murder etc, the SSP said that a sizeable decline in crime was apparent but no statistical study has been made.
