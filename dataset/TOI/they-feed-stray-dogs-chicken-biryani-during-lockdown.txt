MANGALURU: Every morning and for almost three weeks, four youngsters from Sankolige near Talapady have been preparing over 100 plates of chicken biryani. No, they are not meant for celebrations, but to feed stray dogs who have been left without adequate food due to the Covid-19 lockdown.

Professional fitness trainer S Vinyas Kumar Shetty and his friends serve chicken biryani to stray dogs, covering the roads from Talapady in the state border to Nethravati bridge near Mangaluru in the afternoon.

Shetty said stray dogs scarcely get food since all the restaurants and food joints are shut due to the lockdown. “We are at least able to share our difficulties with the authorities concerned or friends. Those dogs on the street have no option, but to live in hunger. Hence, we decided to feed them,” he said.

His friends Nishal Poojary, Pavan Ganiga and Gagan Ganiga are also actively involved in cooking and serving the food. The cooking is done at Vinyas’ house in Sankolige and 25kg of rice is used for preparing chicken biryani.

Their initiative was self-financed initially, but now have the support of donors. Many of his friends and well-wishers are extending support by offering rice and other items. The owner of SK Caterers in Thokkottu has provided delivery van and vessels to supply food. The chicken stall of U P Aliyabba and Canara Chicken – also in Thokkottu -- provide chicken.

“Initially, I shared the idea of feeding street dogs with our friends through social media. Many of my friends and well-wishers started supporting the cause. We start the distribution from Talapady and cover Someshwara, Uchila, Ullal, Deralakatte, Pilar, Madoor and Beeri. We feel happy seeing dogs wait for our vehicle and eat thankfully every day,” he said.
