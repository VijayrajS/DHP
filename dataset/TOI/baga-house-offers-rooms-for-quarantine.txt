SALIGAO: The Goa Province of the Society of Jesus has decided to provide their rooms free as quarantine centres for seafarers returning to Goa. 

In this regard, the provincial of Jesuits Goa Province, Fr Roland Coelho, SJ, has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant over the availability of the Xavier Retreat House at Baga and the Pedro Arrupe Institute at Raia to quarantine seafarers.

Fr Jovito D’Souza from the Xavier Retreat House at Baga said they have also handed over a letter to ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo regarding the availability of the retreat house, which is on the hillock at Baga.

“We have a 30-room facility which is not self-contained, but the Pedro Arrupe Institute at Raia has 35 self-contained rooms. The government has informed us that they will be coming to check the site,” said D’Souza told TOI.
