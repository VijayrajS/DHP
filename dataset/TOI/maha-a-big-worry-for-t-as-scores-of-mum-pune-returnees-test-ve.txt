HYDERABAD: Telangana has witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases as several migrant workers who have returned to their native places in Telangana from Maharashtra, especially from Mumbai and Pune, were found to have been infected with coronavirus. With more than a 100 migrant workers who returned home from Maharashtra testing positive for the coronavirus, officials are a worried lot.





Besides Maharashtra, several other migrant workers who were working in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, have also returned to the state, however, mostly workers coming from Mumbai and Pune have been found to be infected.

Official sources told TOI that though the issuance of e-pass to those coming from states like Maharashtra has been restricted and even cancelled in some cases, authorities are under pressure from local politicians to allow migrant labourers from their districts to return to the state. “Many migrant workers have returned to Telangana in trains or on foot,” said a source.

Among the migrants who returned home and have tested positive for Covid-19, many of them entered the state on foot or by private transport, said officials. 

With the people in rural areas well aware of the spread of Covid-19, authorities are being promptly informed about migrant workers returning home from other states and positive cases, if any. However, in some villages, these returnees are facing discrimination and are being told to leave by the villagers. In Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district, authorities had recently convened a meeting with the district sarpanches and urged them to ensure that the workers are not harassed. Though Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district was Covid-19-free until recently, it now has the highest number of returnees who have tested positive, as many from the district work in Mumbai as daily-wage workers.
