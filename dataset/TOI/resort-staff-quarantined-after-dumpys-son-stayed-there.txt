Nainital: The Nainital district administration on Sunday quarantined the staff members of a resort owned by politician Amar Akbar Dumpy in Ramnagar area of Nainital district after his son stayed at the resort following his return from singer Kanika Kapoor’s party in Lucknow.

A team of police, district administration and health department officials visited the resort on Saturday evening and asked the staff not to leave the resort until they have tested negative for novel coronavirus.

Speaking with TOI, Ramnagar SHO Ravi Saini said that police have also informed their Delhi counterpart that Dumpy’s son, Azaan, has left Uttarakhand and is now in Delhi. “We along with officials from the administration and medical professionals had visited the resort on Saturday. The staff at the resort has been asked not to leave the premise nor is anyone from outside allowed to enter the resort till we are certain that no one is infected there,” Saini said.

Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor had arrived in Lucknow on March 11. Even though she had returned from London a few days back, she did not quarantine herself and went on with her social engagements. She was also present at a party that was attended by many, including former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Azaan had also attended this party and then came back to Ramnagar.

Saini, meanwhile, added that the health department is yet to come up with the report of the staff. However, in the meantime, if Azaan tests negative, the staff will be allowed to leave the quarantine. “We have been informed that Azaan came from Lucknow and stayed in the resort for a night. He is suspected to have interacted others. Therefore, it was necessary that the entire staff should be screened,” Saini said.
