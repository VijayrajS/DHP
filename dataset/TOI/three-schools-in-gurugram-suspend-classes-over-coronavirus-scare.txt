2020-03-09
GURUGRAM: At least three schools in the city sent out advisories to parents in the past 24 hours, announcing suspension of classes as a precautionary measure in the wake of the coronavirus scare.


Heritage Xperiential Learning School (HXLS) said in its circular that the management had held multiple rounds of discussions with teachers and the safety committee, and decided to suspend classes from March 9 to 29 as attendance had dropped substantially. “On Sunday evening, we received a circular announcing the closure of school. However, Shiv Nadar School, where my daughter studies, hasn't announced anything like this,” said Tripti Singh, whose son studies in Heritage.

 Neena Kaul, the principal of HXLS, said, “The well-being of our community is essential to us. In the past few weeks, we have been closely assessing the situation. With the increasing number of suspected cases in Gurugram, we have decided to advance our session break and close the school from March 9 to 29. We will use this time to prepare ourselves better for providing virtual lessons to ensure a seamless a learning experience for our children.” 

Manav Rachna International School in Sector 46 sent out a notification to parents on Saturday, informing them that classes would be closed for toddlers to Class IV. 

“Keeping in mind the safety and security of our students in light of the COVID-19 scares, MIRS-46 has decided to close the session early for the toddlers to Grade IV with effect from March 9,” the circular sent out by the school read. 

“However, the examination for classes V to VIII will be conducted as scheduled and Grade X and XII will have their regular classes,” it added. 

The third school that announced closure of classes was Blue Bells, said sources in the know of things. 

There are more than 500 private schools in the city.
