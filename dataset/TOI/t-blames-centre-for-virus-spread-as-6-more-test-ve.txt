Telangana blames Centre for coronavirus spread as six more test positive
2020-05-02
HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Friday lashed out at the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party for the Covid-19 outbreak in the country as the state reported six more positive cases.


State health minister Eatala Rajender said BJP politicians were making baseless allegations against the government on fewer Covid-19 tests and hiding death toll, when they should actually take the blame for the crisis faced by the country.

“It was the Centre that had permitted Tablighi Jamaat meet at Nizamuddin. Ninety percent of the cases in Telangana are related to the event or their contacts,” Rajender told reporters.

Rajender said that the government is ready to provide treatment for one lakh people, adding that the TRS government had conducted tests on all the attendees of the mid-March Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi.

The health minister went on to explain that the BJP leaders should realize that the inter-ministerial teams sent by the central government had visited various hospitals, red zones and other places, before expressing their satisfaction on the measures taken by the government.

“But the BJP local leaders are trying to politicise the issue and defame the government,” he added. 

So far, 464 persons have been discharged and 552 others (active cases) are being treated in various government hospitals.

“If a person tests positive, his family is being tested for novel coronavirus. The state government is only against indiscriminate testing for Covid-19,” the minister said, adding that ICMR has clearly said only positive cases should be treated in hospitals.
