‘Extend lockdown but open industry’
2020-05-13
Lucknow: “Extend lockdown till May 31 but allow industry and retail” is what UP cabinet ministers have recommended. In a meeting with CM Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday, the ministers said that while precautions are required, especially in light of the returning migrant workers, it was crucial to open up industry and retail to set the economy rolling. 

Sources said the CM took suggestions and feedback from all ministers and the proposal to extend the lockdown till May 31 was almost unanimous.

“Finally, we will do what the Centre and health ministry recommend. However, from the point of view of industry, I recommended that, if possible, we should reduce the containment zones. In Noida, for instance, if we shut down everything in a 1km radius around a confirmed case, then it affects a lot of industries,” said industries minister Satish Mahana.

Another minister said that to create demand and thereby provide a push to the economy, it was equally important to restart retail businesses. He said that while keeping schools, cinema houses and restaurants closed, shops could be allowed to open. A minister also proposed that to ensure distancing and prevent crowds, shops could be opened in a staggered manner or allotted numbers corresponding with the day of the week and allowed to open then. Ministers also discussed the arrival of migrant workers from other states, accepting that while everyone was welcome and efforts would be made to find them employment, the number of Covid-19 cases would also probably see a rise over the next few days.

“The coming 10-15 days will be crucial as cases will probably go up. Already we are seeing the infection prevalent in those coming from outside. However, the state is prepared and after the first two weeks, the situation should settle down,” said one minister.
