Ludhiana: The officials are confused over the standard protocol for coronavirus suspects as after the Ludhiana administration sent three gunmen of the Covid-19-positive ACP to their home districts, the Ferozepur and the Sangrur deputy commissioners have accused the former of not keeping them in the loop.Sangrur DC Ghanshyam Thori said, “The Ludhiana administration had sent the constable deputed with the ACP to his village in Sangrur. We learned about it through a news report when the village panchayat members protested against it. Thereafter, the matter was taken up with the Ludhiana chief medical officer, Rajesh Bagga.”“In Sangrur, if a positive case has a travel history of other districts, we immediately write to them. The Ludhiana CMO should have informed the Sangrur administration before sending the suspect here,” Thori added. Ferozepur DC Kulwant Singh said, “This is a violation of the protocol. The constable should have been kept in a quarantine centre in Ludhiana and not sent here.” However, Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “We followed the standard protocol. If a person is a suspect, he has to be home quarantined after taking his samples for test. The other staff attached with the ACP is from Ludhiana and they too were home quarantined. Two of his gunmen and a driver were from other districts and they were sent for home quarantine. Here, these gunmen were living in one-room accommodation, so sending them home was a safer option.” “These cops were instructed not to step out of their rooms. Their families too were told not to go out. The home quarantine sticker was also pasted outside their houses. The standard protocol was followed,” Agarwal addedManvesh Singh, secretary, Punjab health system corporation, said, “The standard protocol for Covid-19 suspects is to home quarantine them after taking their samples. If they test positive, then they are kept in isolation centers.”
