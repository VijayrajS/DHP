NAWADA/ MOTIHARI: Adhering to the recent directives of the Patna high court to prevent spread of Covid-19 virus, several civil courts across the state, including those in Nawada and East Champaran districts have decided to hear only urgent matters and restrict entry of non-essential people on their premises. 


Nawada civil court judges and judicial magistrates went around the court premises on Wednesday morning and interacted with the advocates on precautionary measures to be adopted for containment of the deadly virus.

The district judge, chief judicial magistrate, accompanied by a number of judicial magistrates as well as the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) secretary-cum-ACJM, toured the court premises to take stock of the situation with the viewpoint of hygiene and social distancing.

Sources said it has been decided that only matters related to emergency cases, bail hearing, injunctions and HC bail orders would be taken up in the truncated court hours (7 to 11am). Common people, other than those involved in urgent cases, would be barred from entering the court premises. The advocates welcomed the move and lauded the preventive steps.

Similarly, East Champaran civil court has also changed its office hour from 6 am to 10 am from Wednesday and all shops on its premises have been closed.

District and sessions judge Krishna Shankar Singh Sengar called a meeting of lawyers and all judicial officers to discuss measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus. Henceforth only urgent matters would be put up in the court for hearing.
