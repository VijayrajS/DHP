Coronavirus in Mumbai: Five caught, sent to forced quarantine after neighbours complain to BMC, cops
2020-03-22
MUMBAI: The municipal corporation and police were inundated with calls about people who have returned from foreign countries and marked with the ‘home quarantine’ stamp moving around in public, instead of staying at home.


While the police control room received more than two dozen calls on Saturday, the BMC’s twitter handle got two complaints from anxious neighbours. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi immediately got his men to get the errant residents to SevenHills Hospital. Pardeshi said the BMC will also register FIRs against the duo under IPC Section 188 for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant. “Despite being given the advantage of home quarantine they choose to disobey. There may be others doing the same. We want to make an example of them so others do not move out when under quarantine,” Pardeshi said.

In another incident, a few residents of BDD chawl in Worli complained to the police that three Dubai-returned people were roaming in the neighbourhood. The police sent the trio to forced quarantine at Kasturba Hospital. “Our teams have caught a few of the violators and put them under forced quarantine...we will now start taking stern action in such cases,” said Vinoy Choubey, joint commissioner of police (law and order).

Meanwhile, Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha intervened in a case wherein a few students were found roaming outside Mulund home after returning from a foreign trip. The students are now staying isolated at their homes. The Kharghar police, accompanied by a doctor and Panvel civic officials, visited a residential tower to check on 37-year-old man, who had returned from the US and was home quarantined. The resident was found to be asymptomatic after a check, but he was advised not to step out till 14 days.
