Coronavirus outbreak: Umrah plans of 40 people hit by flight ban
2020-02-29
VADODARA: A group of 40 devotees from Mahisagar district who wanted to go on Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina had to drop plans after Saudi Arabia halted entry of pilgrims to the country temporarily in wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak – COVID-19. 

The group had also made bookings in the last couple of months for the pilgrimage that was schedule to take off on Thursday.

When a group had come to Ahmedabad to board a flight to Jeddah late on Thursday evening, they were told that the flight was cancelled in wake of the decision by the Saudi government. By that time, many others were either on their way to Ahmedabad or had already reached there.

Iqbal Godhrawala, a resident of Lunawada, who was to go to Ahmedabad was informed about the cancellation when he was about to leave home. “There were 16 of us from Lunawada and all have had to stay back. We are keen to go again and will do so on the next possible date,” said Godhrawala. He added that there were some persons who had already reached Ahmedabad and had to return to Mahisagar district.

The agents are hopeful that the flight tickets will be refunded as the airline had to cancel the flight and not the pilgrims. “We are hopeful of a refund. So far, there is no update as to when travel will resume. We have learnt that the Saudi authorities are working hard to ensure that the virus does not spread there,” said Mohammed Chanda, agent with whom the bookings had been done.

Chanda added that another block booking of tickets for Umrah had been done for March 28. He added that 38 persons had already made bookings for this date too. He added that the visas of the pilgrims were valid for one month.
