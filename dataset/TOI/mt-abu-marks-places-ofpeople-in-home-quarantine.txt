2020-03-23
JAIPUR: People returning from abroad to Mt Abu will now be marked on the back of their palm and will have a sticker stuck on their house for identification.


Authorities in Mt Abu, the only hill station in Rajasthan, have started putting stickers in front of the houses of people in home quarantine. A stamp on the back of their palm have also been put for identification.

Currently, 35 such houses have been identified in the town whose members have returned from different parts of the country and even abroad.

There are people who have come to Mt Abu from New Delhi, Mumbai, Australia and South Africa. Since their arrival, all of them and their families have been put in quarantine for 14 days.

Mt Abu SDM Ravindra Goswami said, “The stickers and seals will be useful in keeping people away from the people who have been quarantined. It doesn’t mean that residents have tested positive for coronavirus. It is just a precautionary measure. Residents of Mt Abu come from all across the country and these steps are necessary. The Apidemic Act gives the administration powers to take such preventive measure,” said Goswami.

The seal reads, ‘Proud to Protect Rajasthan–Home Quarantine’, followed by the date. According to authorities, the people were cooperative.
