2020-02-03
PANAJI: A local man who is suspected to have contracted coronavirus, was placed in the isolation ward of the GMC, Bambolim, on Sunday, taking the total number of people quarantined to two. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI the man was admitted after he was found to be symptomatic. 


On Saturday, a foreign woman was quarantined in the state-run hospital. Her blood sample and nasal swab were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, along with those of a friend who had accompanied her to Goa. 

"Both patients (foreign woman and local man) are fine," Betodkar said. 

Laboratory reports are expected in the next two days, following which the two may either be discharged or made to stay in the hospital. 

Last week, a domestic tourist was quarantined in GMC, but was discharged after he tested negative. He worked in the Chinese city of Kunshan, 750km from Wuhan. In all, 14 people with travel history have been placed under observation so far. 

Any person who has travelled to China since the coronavirus outbreak, or has come in contact with someone who has the disease, is regarded to be a suspect.
