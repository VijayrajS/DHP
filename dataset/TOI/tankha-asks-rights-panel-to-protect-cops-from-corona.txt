BHOPAL: Congress MP Vivek Tankha on Wednesday appealed to the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission to give directions to the chief secretary and DGP so that human rights of police officers and personnel can be protected across the state. 


After the death of two police inspectors due to coronavirus infection, Rajya Sabha MP and lawyer Tankha asked for the protection of the police force with PPE kits and other equipment on Twitter. 

Tankha appealed to the state HRC chairman Justice N K Jain and said, “Satwinder Singh Lally, a retired additional SP has approached the HRC seeking the protection of human right among policemen pressed into Covid duty”. 

“Police personnel on duty has to be properly equipped with PPE kits and other protective gear. The state is mandatorily required by law to protect police personnel from getting infected with coronavirus as they stand exposed in public while performing their duty. Two police officials posted in Indore and Ujjain have succumbed to the deadly virus at Indore’s Aurobindo Hospital,” Tankha added. 

Tankha wrote that many police personnel and their families are in hospital or in quarantine due to coronavirus. “It doesn’t augur well for any government or administration. Who will protect the police?”, he asked. 

“Thousands of policemen on duty and their families are feeling unprotected as police personnel being members of a disciplined force are reluctant and/or feel diffident to articulate their concerns to their superiors,” Tankha added. 

Tankha further said, “The superiors in their overzealous efforts to please the state bosses forget that the force also needs protection from the virus. An earnest request to the HRC to use its legitimate power and authority over the state to ensure the protection of the police .”
