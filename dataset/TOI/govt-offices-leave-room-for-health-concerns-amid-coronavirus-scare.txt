Government offices leave room for health concerns amid coronavirus scare
2020-02-08
MADURAI: Though there has so far been no official instruction to introduce measures in government offices with regard to the spread of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the collector office and corporation office in particular in the city are lacking in cleanliness and hygiene. These offices are highly vulnerable for the spread of the virus.


“The first thing to remember is personal hygiene. We have asked everyone, from students to public, to practice hand washing regularly to prevent spread of any infection, including nCoV. However, there has so far been no instruction in particular to step up cleanliness measures because there is hardly any risk here in Madurai,” said a senior corporation health official. However, both the corporation office and collector office was devoid of provision for soaps and hand wash solutions for washing hands in the toilets.

The open grounds in the campus of both offices have litter strewn in many spots despite the presence of sanitary workers. Since the collector office sees hundreds gather to submit grievances every week, which makes the offices vulnerable to easy spread of infections. At the corporation office, there is water stagnating in the defunct fountain. Many students, who come to the corporation office campus grounds, to prepare for union public service commission (UPSC) exams are also facing health concerns.

“We usually just sit on the grounds with bed sheets spread out. We also eat our lunch out in the open. We got used to it but we see litter strewn around that is not cleaned,” said one of the aspirants. After lunch, often many wash their hands in the open using cups of water from the tank or from their personal water bottles. The open grounds are also invaded by stray dogs in the area.
