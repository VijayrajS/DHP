SURAT: City police received a setback on Sunday when a 52-year-old assistant sub inspector of Mahidharpura police station succumbed to the virus which had relapsed five days after he was discharged from the hospital. 

Magan Bariya, who was put in isolation at New Civil Hospital (NCH) since May 30, suffered other co-morbidities including from diabetes and high blood pressure. 

Colleagues mourn the death of Bariya, a soft spoken and straight forward man, who started having complications after he was released from the hospital on June 9. “After he again started feeling unwell on June 11, his kin brought him to NCH for test on June 13 and by the time his results of testing positive arrived, Bariya had already passed away,” a colleague in Mahidharpura police station said.

Bariya was posted on various bandobust duties at important spots on road in limits of the police station. A homeguard jawan posted with Bariya in Bhagal was found positive in last week of May. Having few symptoms Bariya got self tested and he too was found positive. 

Bariya was native of Panchmahal district. His family lives in Lalita Park of Katargam.

"This is the first case for us as well where a patient was discharged recovery and again developed Covid-19 symptoms. It may be a case of late representation of Covid-19 symptoms. He was suffering from diabetes and hypertension as well,'' Dr. Ashish Naik, Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Health), SMC, told TOI. 

At least three policeman in Ahmedabad have succumbed to Covid-19 infection while 35 have tested positive.
