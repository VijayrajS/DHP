WII launches ‘Lockdown wildlife tracker’ app
2020-04-22
Nagpur: To record wildlife during the lockdown period, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, has launched an app ‘Lockdown Wildlife Tracker’.

“We were thinking about it for quite some time and our scientist, Bilal Habib, has finally developed it. At a time when people are locked in their homes due to Covid-19, there are more and more reports of wildlife exploring human-dominated areas,” said WII director Dhananjai Mohan.

“We’ve written to the chief wildlife wardens of all states to ask their field staff to download the app and record animals while they are patrolling or when they are on any other field duty. This will enable us to know the closest forest and study reasons for such movement and prepare a report for management inputs,” added Mohan. 

The director said that after the lockdown period, WII will share the data with the respective states and shall also come up with detailed state specific reports as well as the national report. 

“As of now, these records on stray animals are being circulated on WhatsApp. However, this information is very critical in understanding human-wildlife interface in the country. The information shall help in wildlife conservation and management in the long run,” said Mohan.

“The Lockdown Wildlife Tracker will make data collection easier and wide spread. The app makes it easy to record wildlife from the comfort of your home or while in the field. These sightings can be reported in real time as well as at any later period, but only till the quarantine lasts,” said Mohan.

One can even upload photos of sightings on the app. This free app makes it convenient to keep track of what you see, while making your data available for further analysis and interpretation. The app can be downloaded from the WII website (wii.gov.in). The app will be available for download from Google store in a couple of days with more options, especially the bilingual version.
