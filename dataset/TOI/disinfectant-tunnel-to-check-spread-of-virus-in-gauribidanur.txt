2020-04-06
GAURIBIDANUR (CHIKKABALLAPUR): A locally built ‘disinfectant tunnel’ is coming in handy for the administration in Gauribidanur town of Chikkaballapur district to ward off the Covid-19 infection threat even as the townsfolk go about their daily purchase of essentials.


The tunnel, measuring 8 feet tall, 6 feet wide and 20 feet long and prepared in two days at a cost of Rs 20,000, was launched on Sunday for public use in Gauribidanur’s Main Bazaar Road leading to the town’s wholesale market. 

About 500 residents heading to the market walked through the tunnel where a bio-organic disinfectant was sprayed on them using locally available sprayers. 

The tunnel is the result of an initiative taken up by KAS officer Varaprasad Reddy, who was appointed as the nodal officer for preventing the spread of Covid-19 after Gauribidanur reported three positive cases in the last few days. 

Reddy said the disinfectant is totally organic and is made of citric derivatives such as lemon, orange and other fruits and vegetables. The disinfectant is eco-friendly and people friendly and will not cause any side effects, he said. 

The officer said the tunnel was built using locally available material including polythene sheets. The technical knowhow and organic disinfectants were provided by a Bengaluru NGO. 

Reddy said depending on the response from people, similar tunnels would be built elsewhere in the district. 

Chikkaballapur deputy commissioner R Latha told TOI that preliminary tests had proved that the of tunnel was totally safe and would be effective in preventing the spread of the virus. She said the district administration has been successful in preventing the spread of the disease beyond Gauribidanur taluk.
