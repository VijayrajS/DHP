SERAMPORE: Trinamool MP from Arambagh Aparupa Poddar gave birth to a baby girl at a nursing home in Hooghly’s Serampore early on Thursday. The MP and her husband, Md Shakir Ali, have named their newborn, Corona. The couple has another daughter, aged six.

“The chaos over the virus will get over with time, but history will remember the word, ‘Corona’. The CM has asked after my wife’s health. She will also give our daughter her official name. Corona will be her nickname. I did not admit my wife to a Kolkata facility as hospitals there are under pressure. I am happy that our second child was born in this Serampore nursing home,” said Ali, a Trinamool councillor of Rishra Municipality.
