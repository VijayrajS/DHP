MUZAFFARNAGAR: Police in UP’s Muzaffarnagar on Sunday “home-delivered” copies of 63 FIRs at the door steps of 275 people booked for violating lockdown on the first day of its novel initiative to keep people indoors.


Upping the ante against the lockdown violators, local police has now decided to not only register but also home-deliver FIRs to offenders based on video footage and CCTV surveillance. On Sunday, CCTV grabs of policemen baton-charging people coming out of their houses also surfaced on social media.

Notably, as many as 1,300 people who were caught breaking lockdown here in Muzaffarnagar have been booked under section 188 of IPC so far.

Several people, including 12 Jamaatis from Nepal, were slapped with sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code.

Senior superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav had ordered to track the lockdown violators by using CCTV cameras, mobile phone footages and deliver FIR copies at their doorsteps. “We will continue to register cases against them. If someone is found violating the lockdown twice, we will send him to jail,” the SSP said.
