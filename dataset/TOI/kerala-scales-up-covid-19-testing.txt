Kerala scales up Covid-19 testing
2020-03-27
Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala, which has recorded 138 Covid cases so far, is going by the words of World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as it has accelerated testing process considerably, especially in the past two weeks. At NIV Alappuzha, the number of samples being handled a day has increased by four times in the past one week. Along with three other states, Kerala has the highest number of government approved laboratories — eight.

In the first 10 days of March, the state tested 691 samples and in the next 14 days, the testing spiked to 3,723 samples. As cases began to turn positive, the number of people who were brought under surveillance rose from 3,313 to 1.02 lakh in just two weeks, preventing exposure of a large section of society to symptomatic persons as well as those under observation. 

Speedy results from multiple facilities have so far enabled three crucial steps in containment; identifying primary contacts, tracking possibilities of infection followed by isolation and monitoring.

“Only if we do tests, we would know the sources of infection which could enable us to initiate steps for containment. The faster you do it, the better, especially considering that exposure of immuno-suppressed persons to infected persons could lead to an uncontrollable spread. Early testing helps us in quicker isolation steps,” a health official said

Equipped with eight testing facilities across the state, and awaiting one more, and having to deal with samples from 13 Covid-affected districts, the health department has prepared a sample distribution channel (SDC) to facilitate sample collection and arrival at testing facilities in minimum time across a larger network. When Covid cases were confirmed in Pathanamthitta after a brief silent period of the first series of outbreak, health authorities realized that speed in detecting positive cases mattered in containing the spread.

Earlier, samples from all districts were pooled in at Ernakulam and then transported to Kalamassery Medical college from where it airlifted to Pune. On February 2, the testing began at NIV, Alappuzha. As case load surged, testing was initiated at Medical colleges in Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur. In the meantime, the authorities pushed proposals for Covid testing facilities at Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology, Thiruvanathapuram, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences, Thiruvanathapuram, State Public Health Laboratory, Thiruvanathapuram and Interuniversity, Kottayam.

The health department has also put in place a system for self-manufacture of viral transport medium (VTM) which is crucial in the process of transportation of samples. In addition, the government is set to procure PCR machines for medical colleges in Ernakulam, Kottayam, Pariyaram, and Parippally and once the machines are installed, proposal would be sent to ICMR for starting Covid testing facility in these places as well. 

NIV Alappuzha has consistently handled around 150 samples a day for the past one week. The machine can load 96 samples at a time and the initial RNA isolation process takes 1.5 hours for around 24 samples.
