Aurangabad: The city police have warned to take strict action against those who are found playing a prank or cracking jokes related to coronavirus on April 1 on social media or even otherwise on account of April Fool’s Day. 

Commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said, “We want citizens to abstain from playing any kind of prank related to Covid-19. Those who do so will face legal consequences.”

Deputy commissioner of police (headquarter) Meena Makwana issued a public notice under section 68 of Maharashtra Police Act on Monday citing that she was convinced that people may crack jokes related to Covid-19,which may snowball into a law and order situation. 

She even warned that if any person was found playing a prank, an offence would be registered against him under section 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by authorities) of the IPC. 

Police authorities have even asked administrators of Whatsapp groups to change the settings and restrict posting of any messages related to Covid-19 on April 1. “If need be, police will not hesitate to slap sections of the Information Technology Act, making the offence cognizable and non-bailable,” said a senior police officer.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh too has released a video appealing to people to abstain from cracking jokes or playing a prank on friends, acquaintances or relatives.
