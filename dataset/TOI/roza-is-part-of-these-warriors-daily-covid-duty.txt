2020-05-23
Rajkot: Duty during the month of Ramzan is no different for these 22 devouts from Amreli than in normal times. They have been working as frontline warriors in the battle against the virus ever since the outbreak happened. Under religious strictures, these parched men continue to perform their duties round-the-clock even if the unrelenting sun scorches at 43°Celsius. “While observing ‘roza’ forget food, we are not even allowed to swallow our saliva! So, we have no option to wait till the evening to break our fasts after duty at Iftaar,” says Amanat Ali Naqwi, an official with 108 emergency services at Amreli. “Apart from Naqwi, Zakir Jakhara, Altaf Dal, Arif Sheikh and Akbar Parmar have been performing their duty while observing the holy fasts,” said a programme officer of 108 emergency services. “To observe roza during the holy month of Ramzan is our duty, while responding to the call of emergencies during the Covid-19 crisis is our supreme duty. Hence, we perform both our duties religiously, not sacrificing one for the other,” said Zakir Jakhara. HINDUS PREPARE IFTAAR FOR MUSLIMS Rajkot: Hindus of Ambaradi village in Savarkundala taluka in Amreli district have displayed great communal amity during lockdown.
