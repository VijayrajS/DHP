HOOGHLY: The state government is planning to shift 48 patients, who tested positive for Covid-19, from Singur quarantine centre to a Covid hospital. The positive patients, all residents of Wards 11 and 12 in Urdibazar under Chandannagar Municipal Corporation, are likely to be shifted by Monday, said an official. They were among 62 people undergoing treatment at the centre.

Trouble broke out in the quarantine centre on Saturday when some officials from health department and district administration had gone there to shift the positive patients. They had refused to get admitted to a Covid hospital and allegedly gone on a rampage, assaulting cops. Two cops, touched by some patients were quarantined.
