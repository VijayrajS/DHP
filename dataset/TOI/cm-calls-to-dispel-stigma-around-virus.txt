AMARAVATI: Elimination of social stigma surrounding Covid-19 is key to defeat the virus, said chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Tuesday, directing officials to take up an aggressive campaign to create awareness among the public. He said that discrimination against Covid-19 positive patients and their family members is preventing many others from voluntarily coming forward to undergo screening. 


Jaganmohan Reddy reviewed Covid-19 containment measures with officials at the camp office on Tuesday. He directed them to not compromise on screening of Covid-19 patients in all four districts, which have been reporting fresh cases due to Koyambedu (Tamil Nadu) market links. 

Special chief secretary (health) KS Jawahar Reddy said 20 of the 33 positive cases reported in Chittoor, Nellore and East Godavari districts in the last 24 hours have Koyambedu links and 13 positive cases reported in Ananthapuram and Kurnool districts have links with Kalyan in Mumbai. 

Citing an example, officials informed the chief minister that the family of a government employee did not allow him to come back home even after recovering. The chief minister asked officials to focus on launching awareness programmes on a large scale to lower fears surrounding the disease.

The chief minister asked officials to concentrate on non-Covid-19 patients and the availability of treatment facilities for them. He asked them to ensure that normalcy returns to hospitals in the state. 

During the meeting, Jaganmohan Reddy also asked officials of the agriculture, marketing and civil supplies departments to step up paddy procurement. He asked officials to keep in mind untimely rains and cyclones while planning procurement operations and clear payments to farmers after completion of the procurement process.
