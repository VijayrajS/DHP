2020-03-28
KOLKATA: The city police has started looking for a youth who had returned from the US but broken his quarantine period after reaching Gurugram. The young man, instead, travelled to Kolkata in a flight after serving merely five days in quarantine instead of the minimum of two weeks. The cops went on an overdrive after a Gurugram resident brought the matter to the notice of Kolkata Police through her tweet.


She also tweeted a photograph of the Gurugram Muninicipal Corporation notice put up outside the man’s residence warning others not to visit his residence. 

According to the post by Gurugram-based Anjali Sharma, a resident of the same tower and the same condo at Sector 56, where the youth had put up, the man had been put on quarantine by Gurugram Corporation between March 16 and April 1. But he reportedly boarded a Kolkata-bound flight on March 21. “His house in our society was marked quarantine on March 23 (ex post facto date March 16). But, the family had already flown to Kolkata on March 21. This is for the necessary information of authorities,” she wrote in her tweet. “We are in touch with relevant authorities in this regard,” said a senior officer of the social media cell of Kolkata Police.
