2020-03-18
TRICHY: An woman passenger who returned from one of the countries most affected by Covid-19 was made to stay at one of the shops-turned-hospital wards at the central market for vegetables, fruits and flowers at Kallikudi late on Monday. 


It was the usual screening and verification process that revealed that she had returned from one of these countries. An employee of a private company, she had no symptoms, but public health department and airport health officials advised her to be quarantined at the makeshift ward at the central market at Kallikudi on the Trichy- Madurai national highway. 

As the passenger agreed to be quarantined, she was provided accommodation at the market. “Though the passenger has no symptom, the quarantine has to be done for a day to check for any symptom because of the passenger’s visit to the affected countries,” deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr A Subramani told TOI. Such passengers have to be quarantined for 14 days but if the passenger seems healthy, the doctors will decide on discharge in a few days. 

A team of doctors has already been posted here to check the passenger for any symptom such as temperature, cough, sneezing and difficulty in breathing. A couple of policemen have also been posted for security. Besides providing food for the passengers staying here, the public health department has planned to set up Wi-Fi television in the rooms. Currently, the facility can accommodate 75 passengers. The department said protocols are being followed in keeping the information of the passengers confidential as it would cause stigma and also discourage people from taking treatment.
