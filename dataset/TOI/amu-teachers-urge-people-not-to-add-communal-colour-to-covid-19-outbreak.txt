AMU teachers urge people not to add communal colour to Covid-19 outbreak
2020-04-06
AGRA: Worried over the rise in the number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases due to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz, senior faculty members of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), on Sunday, said that the event was an aberration and warned people against communalising the Covid-19 outbreak. They also urged the Union government to bring the guilty to book.

Taking strong exception to attempts being made by certain people to hold all Muslims responsible and to be squarely blamed for accentuating the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, faculty members expressed their deep concern. They were particularly concerned over the campaign launched by such people to add a communal colour to this monumental human tragedy.

In an appeal signed by several professors, it was stated that there had been negligence in allowing such a large gathering, knowing well that the deadly Covid-19 has already spread its tentacles far and wide. The professors were of the opinion that the Nizamuddin Markaz episode is only an aberration as the Muslim community is religiously following all the instructions and directives of the Union government, including social distancing, complete lockdown and maintaining personal hygiene, and is cooperating fully with the local authorities.

AMU faculty members called upon the Centre to institute a high-level inquiry on the lapses. The AMU faculty also appealed to all sections of society, including the Muslim community, that at a time when the entire human race is passing through a huge crisis, “we should join hands and face the menace of Covid-19 together, with full determination and should follow all the directives of the government and advice of the doctors so as to win this battle against the deadly virus”.
