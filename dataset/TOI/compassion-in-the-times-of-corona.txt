Ludhiana: Compassion in the times of coronavirus
2020-03-24
LUDHIANA: Even as the world bolted itself inside houses mostly for fear of catching the coronavirus, a group of Muslims in Malerkotla went all the way to Domniwal village in Tan Taran district to help a poor Sikh girl get married. The men belong to an NGO, Sikh Muslim Sanjhan (SMS).


“We had seen a video on the social media through which we came to know that the girl, Mandeep Kaur of the Domniwal village, was to get married. We came to know that she doesn’t have parents. So we decided to help her and located her family comprising brother and four sisters.

 “After that we collected money and went to her village after we came to know that her marriage, which was slated for Sunday, was advanced by a day due to corona lockdown. We handed her a ‘shagun’ comprising Rs 17,000 and a wedding dress,” said Dr Naseer Akhter, founder chairman of SMS, who had also attended the wedding.

According to sources, bride’s father Kashmir Singh had died about 21 years ago and her mother Sawinder Kaur died two years ago. Their grandfather’s brother did help them to some extent but Mandeep, her brother and sisters had to manage on their own to a large extent. 

Harmandeep Singh, Mandeep’s brother, said they are thankful to Muslim brothers for their wonderful gesture and help.
