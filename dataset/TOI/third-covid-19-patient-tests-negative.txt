2020-04-22
Kolhapur: City’s third Covid-19 patient has tested negative for the first time after she was admitted to the isolation ward of the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital around 14 days ago.

The 63-year-old woman, a resident of Kasba Bawda, will be tested again in the next couple of days. If the result comes out as negative, the woman will be discharged from the hospital on Saturday and will have to remain home quarantined for another 2 weeks.

The woman has been suffering from tuberculosis owing to which the medical staff at the civil hospital took extra care of her. Now, the health of the close contacts of the first three Covid-19 patients is being monitored closely. 

Till now, none of the 21 people in institutional quarantine and 99 in home quarantine have shown any symptoms of coronavirus.

“We are going to test the contacts of the first two positive cases and discharge them if they test negative. Same process will be followed for the contacts of the third positive patient. After being discharged, the high risk contacts will be advised to remain under home quarantine for 2 weeks. The close contacts are mostly related to each other. Hence, we cannot take any chance of discharging them unless they test negative,” a senior health official said

Most of the close contacts of the Covid-positive patients have been admitted to the isolation wards of the civil hospital. The administration claims that discharging them will help reduce the stress on the inadequate staff.

“Many cases are asymptomatic and the person does not feel ill or show any signs. Due to such strange nature of the disease we have to ensure that no person is discharged without being tested at least twice. The incubation period of coronavirus varies from person to person depending on other factors such as age, morbidity and immunity,” the official added.
