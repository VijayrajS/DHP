LUCKNOW: A 34-year-old HIV positive man who successfully defeated Covid-19 was discharged from KGMU on Monday after his two consecutive tests for novel coronavirus came negative.

The patient was brought to the trauma centre on May 16 after sustaining head injuries in a road accident while he was going to Delhi from Gonda. During treatment, he told doctors that he was HIV positive. 

As per the protocol, he was tested for Covid-19 and found positive for it as well and shifted to isolation ward and recovered in nine days. 

KGMU vice-chancellor Prof MLB Bhatt said: “It was our first case wherein patient carried both HIV and novel Coronavirus infections. Since HIV positive people have low immunity, his recovery had come as a moral-booster for doctors.”

“The patient had concussion caused by a blow to the head. He was examined by the neurosurgery team regularly and given medicines to reduce pressure on the brain due to accumulation of fluids,” said in charge of infectious disease unit at KGMU, Dr D Himanshu.

“There was no need to take extra precautions for HIV because all the steps taken for novel coronavirus were enough. We continued his antiretroviral therapy to keep viral load of HIV virus low and keep up the T cell count that are responsible for better functioning of immune system. Simultaneously, we gave symptomatic treatment for Covid-19,” he added.

“It is too early to draw any conclusions that because of antiretroviral treatment recovery of the patient from Covid-19 was quick because both are different in nature,” he said.

The patient has been advised 14-day home quarantine and then visit for follow-up when he would tested again.
