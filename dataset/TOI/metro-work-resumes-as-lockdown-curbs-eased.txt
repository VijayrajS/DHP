2020-05-05
Kanpur: After relaxation in lockdown by Central government for starting work, and getting district administration’s nod, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) has resumed civil construction work of Kanpur Metro project while abiding by the regulations issued by Union home ministry and following standard operating procedures (SOP) approved by ministry of housing and urban affairs. The work has started at Metro casting yard and Metro depot site.

On Sunday, UPMRC said construction work started on April 30 and is now going on at Metro casting yard and Metro depot site at government polytechnic. The work at both the sites is being carried out in only one shift — from 9am to 6pm.

All workers, supervisors, engineers and officers are being subjected to thermal screening for entry to construction sites, UPMRC said.

Metro officers are also ensuring that social distancing is duly maintained during work.

All precautions are being taken against spread of Covid-19 infection including disinfecting constructions sites, vehicles and other material in use.

Before the announcement of lockdown, civil construction work of Kanpur Metro project was proceeding at an extraordinary pace, but had to be halted in unavoidable conditions due to the global pandemic. Following instructions of UPMRC, contractors have made arrangements of food and shelter for workers so that project work resumes as soon as government issues instructions.
