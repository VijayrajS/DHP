2020-05-03
VIJAYAWADA: The government has decided to open quarantine facilities in all village secretariats in the state to check the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas as people stranded in other states are likely to return home in the next few days due to the relaxation in lockdown norms. 


Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, during his review meeting on Saturday, told officials to make the required arrangements for the same. As of now, most village secretariats are functioning from government buildings. 

In some places, buildings have been taken on rent to house the secretariats. All of them would now be turned into quarantine facilities with a minimum bed strength of 15.

The chief minister also asked all government departments to coordinate pandemic mitigation in the state and ensure the virus is controlled at the primary contact level. 

He directed officials to press into service at least 500 RTC buses to supply essentials to people in the lockdown areas. 

The buses would be remodelled to carry perishables like milk, eggs, vegetables and fruits. Some of these buses could also be used for health workers with basic medical facilities for both corona and general diseases, he told officials.
