2020-04-07
Hyderabad: The CPM has demanded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should conduct an all-party teleconference on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s teleconference with all-party leaders on April 8.

“The need of the hour in this time of crisis is to fight unitedly against coronavirus. CM KCR should take suggestions of all the political parties whose cadre are giving feedback from the field about the gaps and requirements to effectively prevent the spread of coronavirus,” CPM state secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram said in a letter addressed to the CM. He said the state government has taken up several measures to effectively fight against the spread of coronavirus. However, some sections are trying to give a communal colour to the spread of coronavirus. TNN
