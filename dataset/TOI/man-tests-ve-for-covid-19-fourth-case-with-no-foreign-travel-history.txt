PUNE: A 40-year-old critically-ill man from Sahakarnagar, a known patient of chronic liver disease, tested positive for the Covid-19 infection on Thursday.


With this, four cases have been found in the city within a week where the source of infection is not linked to international travel or a traceable contact to infected person.

The man was admitted to a private hospital after he complained of breathlessness. His throat swab sample when sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) was found positive for Covid19, pushing Pune’s positive case tally to 32 so far.

Of the total Pune cases, the health condition of 20 is being monitored by Pune Municipal Corporation health officials. Fifteen of them are currently undergoing treatment at designated government and private isolation hospitals and five of them have been discharged after successful recovery. Another 12 infected persons are undergoing treatment at identified facilities in Pimpri Chinchwad.

“As per preliminary reports, the man has not travelled abroad recently nor has he come in close contact with infected persons or their known close contacts. We are investigating the case. The man’s close contacts are being traced,” a civic health official said.

An official from the private hospital where the man is undergoing treatment said, “His condition is critical. He is put on ventilator support in the hospital’s isolation ICU.” 

A state health official said, “Of the four Covid-19 patients with no apparent history of foreign travel, condition of three is critical and they are on the ventilator support.”

In Mumbai, a 53-year-old physician and two of his family members have tested positive for Covid-19. The trio are undergoing treatment at a private hospital and are said to be stable.

Mumbai civic body officials didn’t officially confirm the case, but told TOI that apart from practising in his own clinic, he also consulted in two hospitals nearby. The civic body has started an elaborate contact tracing exercise.

His 43-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter also tested positive. His son’s report was negative.
