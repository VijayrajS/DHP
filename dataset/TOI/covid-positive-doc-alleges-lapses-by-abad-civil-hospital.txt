Vadodara: The resident doctor of state-run SSG Hospitalm who tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, has alleged that Ahmedabad Civil Hospital is simply not following protocol and guidelines related to Covid.Sharing his experience at the civil hospital, where he was on deputation, Dr Suketu Dave claimed that even the donning and doffing areas are not proper putting the frontline warriors at risk.“The guidelines are very clear. There should be a separate donning area where doctor put on the personal protection equipment (PPE). Similarly, there should be doffing area to remove and set away the PPE for safe disposal once the duty hours are over. This is not being taken care of at the civil hospital, risking health of everyone involved in treatment of patients,” alleged Dave.Dave was also involved in treatment of patients both at SSG Hospital and GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri in Vadodara.“Similarly, there should be enough sterillium (ready-to-use alcohol-based rub-in), soaps and things like washbasins should be in proper condition. But this is not the case at civil hospital,” said Dave, who served at the isolation ward there between May 6 and May 12.Many patients have complained about the quality of food served to them, but the condition of doctors is no different.“The food served to the patients as well as doctors should be protein-rich to boost their immunity. The quality there is so pathetic that nobody can complete a meal. Residents like me complained about this several times but all in vain,” said Dave, who was part of the first batch of 19 resident doctors from medicine, pulmonology and anesthesia who were on deputation at Ahmedabad.Resident doctors are demanding that the state government should bear the expense of treatment of health workers who get admitted at private hospitals.
