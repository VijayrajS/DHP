Visakhapatnam: The Covid-19 pandemic has mango farmers in Visakhapatnam district worried. Lockdowns in a bid to control the spread of infection has brought all farm work to a standstill, besides affecting the fruit’s procurement and export chain.

G Latcha Reddy, of Tuni wholesale market, the largest in the four districts of north-coastal AP, said for mango crop to be sold, it first has to reach the markets. “We fear that the clampdown could seriously affect mobility of agricultural labour, drastically affecting procurement capacity,” he said.

The procurement process usually begins after Ugadi and continues till May. “This is when a large team of people are employed in orchards to pluck fruits. They usually live on the farms till the end of the season. With such restrictions in place, we will not find labour and transport,” he added. M Ayyappa, a wholesaler from Narsipatnam, said lakhs of daily wage workers find employment during the procurement process. “Losses for the rural economy will be monumental if the lockdown continues,” he said.
