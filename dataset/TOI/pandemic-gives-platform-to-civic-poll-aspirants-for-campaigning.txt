Pandemic gives platform to civic poll aspirants for campaigning
2020-06-08
AURANGABAD: Several candidates aspiring to be corporators in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation are trying to use the lockdown period for image building as well as poll campaigning. The civic body elections are scheduled soon after the Covid-19 contagion is contained.

Right from providing ration kits, conducting the thermal screening, supplying Arsenic 30 tablets, distributing hand sanitisers and face-masks, all aspiring candidates are reaching out to people to provide relief measures ahead of the civic polls.

Abhishek Beedkar, a resident of HUDCO, said he witnessed a competition among poll aspirants in offering aid and relief measures with a definite motive. “First an aspirant from BJP camp offered face-masks in our area, prompting sitting corporator and independent to supply Arsenic 30 album tablets. The Shiv Sena aspirant jumped into the fray by carrying out fumigation and thermal screening. Needless to say, pamphlets were distributed by each of these aspirants while reaching out in our areas,” he said.

Shiv Sena leader and sitting corporator Raju Vaidya said every help does not necessarily have selfish motives. “It is wrong to have any prejudices against the help offered by poll aspirants. Many people rely on such help, especially when it comes to seeking benefits of government welfare programmes and initiatives,” he said.

The five-year term for 115-member Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) ended on April 28, following which civic body chief Astik Kumar Pandey has been appointed as an administrator. The state government on March 16 approached the Election Commission with a plea for deferring AMC and other polls for three months in the wake of the outbreak of Covid 19, to which poll panel agreed.
