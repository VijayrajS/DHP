Sindri: The Dhanbad district administration on Friday imposed a curfew within a 3-km radius around Baghakudi Basti in Kumardhubi under Egyarkund block of the district from Thursday midnight. The move comes after a 23-year-old resident of the locality tested positive for Covid-19, making it the first case in the district.

With the curfew in place, all entry and exit points of the village have been sealed. The administration has circulated a phone number through which residents of the containment zone can seek help to get essential items, including foodgrains, milk and water. 

Besides, a 7-km radius from the house of the affected person has been declared as buffer zone in which restricted entry and exit are allowed to people with valid reasons. The administration has also created 21 check posts at strategic places of the district to stop people from coming out of their houses without any valid reason. Magistrates have been deployed at all the posts and SP (city) R Ramkumar himself was seen checking vehicles in Dhanbad. 

The district administration heaved a sigh of relief when test reports of all the five family members of the Covid-19 patient turned out to be negative. Dhanbad DC Amit Kumar, SSP Kishore Kaushal and SDO Raj Maheshwaram visited Baghakudi Basti on Friday and spoke to neighbours of the patient. Maheshwaram said, “The neighbours told us that after returning from Jamuria in Asansol on April 5 with coronavirus-like symptoms, the patient had fully quarantined himself and did not meet anybody from the village.”

When asked how the positive youth returned to his Baghakudi home from Jamuria in Asansol on a motorcycle despite complete lockdown, the SDO said that the administration is looking into the incident.
