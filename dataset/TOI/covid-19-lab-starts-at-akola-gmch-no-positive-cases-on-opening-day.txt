Nagpur: The much awaited Covid-19 sample testing facility began at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Akola on Sunday. Total 25 samples were tested on the first day and all of them were negative.

“This lab will now test all samples coming from Akola, Washim and Buldhana districts. We are working round the clock and conduct tests in three batches a day. We can test 42 samples per batch,” said Dr Apurva Pavde, dean of GMCH Akola. The new lab facility will reduce load on AIIMS lab at Nagpur. Now, AIIMS will deal with samples coming from Amravati and Yavatmal only.

On Sunday, Nagpur recorded 17 confirmed positive cases of Covid-19, which is a record for any city in Vidarbha. The region had recorded 22 new cases on March 9, which is still a record. Total Covid-19 cases in Vidarbha are now 92, including three deaths. Total 11 patients out of these 92 have recovered and discharged. Four others will be discharged over the next week. 

An 80-year-old man, a patient of cough and breathing trouble from Yavatmal, died in the ICU of local GMCH on Sunday. Even if he was not a suspect of Covid-19, district administration decided to test his swab for tests. The samples will be tested in Nagpur on Monday. 

As Yavatmal is under the grip of Covid-19 with eight confirmed positive cases, the containment drive is under way in full swing here. Isolation wards in Yavatmal GMCH have 182 cases as on Sunday. Forty of them have tested negative.

There are 91 persons in home quarantine and 93 in institutional quarantine at Yavatmal. Some 33,000 residents in sealed areas of Jafar Nagar, Memon Society and Indira Nagar are also restricted in their home quarantine. 

On Monday, 45 samples from Amravati, seven from Chandrapur, and more than 80 samples from Yavatmal will be tested at Nagpur.
