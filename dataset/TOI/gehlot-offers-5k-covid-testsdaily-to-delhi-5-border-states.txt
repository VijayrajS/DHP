2020-06-15
JAIPUR: Considering the Covid-19 emergencies in neighbouring states, chief minister Ashok Gehlot offered to provide 5,000 Covid tests daily to Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat on Sunday. “Rajasthan is committed to providing all possible help to its neighbouring states in times of need. The state which started with zero testing capacity has now reached a total capacity of 15,000 per day,” said Gehlot in an official press statement.

The state is likely to raise its daily testing capacity to 25,000 after the arrival of two machines from the US. Delhi and Gujarat have been reporting delays in providing test results due to the shortage of machines. The offer could come as a major relief to these governments. The decision came during a review meeting held at the CM’s residence on Sunday evening. Gehlot expressed concern over the reports of how people were not following the unlock rules properly. 

“People have to follow all health protocols at any cost. The lockdown has been relaxed to provide a window for economic activities. The health of our citizens is high on our priority,” said Gehlot.

He also directed officials to continue to enforce health protocols by regular testing and monitoring of those who are vulnerable. Meanwhile, Gehlot has also relaxed the rules for MGNREGA workers, keeping in view the harsh weather conditions. “The MGNREGA workers are allowed to return home at 11am or even before that, provided they have completed their given task. It is done to provide ease to these workers as the temperature is very high these days,” he said.
