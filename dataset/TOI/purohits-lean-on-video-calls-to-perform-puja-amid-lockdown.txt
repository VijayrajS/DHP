Hyderabad: Purohits lean on video calls to perform puja amid lockdown
2020-04-04
HYDERABAD: Several Purohits have taken to internet to perform their religious duties with several of them making use of video calls to perform pujas amid the 21-day lockdown. The purohits are accepting accepting online requests for ‘seemantham’ (baby shower), ‘gruhapravesam’ (housewarming), ‘masikam’ (a ritual performed after death) or ‘shraddha karmas’.
 

“There are few rituals or ceremonies which cannot be postponed. So online services come handy,” said MV Rangarajan, a priest at Chilkur Balaji Temple. He said most purohits are adapting to the change. He said his family hired veda pandits from Tamil Nadu for his niece’s seemantham, online. 

Sukanya V, who had to hire a purohit for masikam, said that she was forced to use the online option. “We could not find anyone who would come to our house. So, we requested our purohit to perform the rituals virtually,” said Sukanya, adding this is the first time they used video calls for such rites. She said that they also transferred the ‘dakshina’ online. 

P Ramana Murthy, whose gruhapravesam is scheduled on April 8 said a purohit will be guiding them via video calls. “ As no purohit is ready to travel, we will go ahead with the rites via video calls,” he said. 

Purohits said that they accept online requests only if they know that the person has a basic knowledge about the rituals. “It’s hard to explain everything virtually.” said Ananda Sharma, a purohit. They also said ‘dakshina’ will be a little less for online pujas as they need not travel to clients’ homes.
