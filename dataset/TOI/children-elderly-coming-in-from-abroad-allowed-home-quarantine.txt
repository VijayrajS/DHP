2020-05-23
VIJAYAWADA: The state health department has decided to exempt pregnant women, children below the age of 10 and people above the age of 65 arriving from abroad on Vande Bharat mission flights from institutional quarantine. Such people will be able to avail home quarantine after swabs are collected from them for testing.


Others exempted from institutional quarantine are people coming to India for a health emergency, for a death in the family and those returning to the country after receiving treatment at health facilities abroad. 

However, if the swab test comes out positive, those people will be hospitalised and their contacts will be put in quarantine. Generally, people arriving from abroad are sent to a quarantine centre, either paid or a government-run centre. 

These exemptions will be applicable only to people coming in on special Vande Bharat mission flights.

For inter-state movement, all those coming by buses with proper permission from the Andhra Pradesh government will be allowed to go to the district reception centre (DRC) with police assistance.

For those with permission only from the location of origin, their details will be first uploaded on the Spandana mobile application upon arrival, after which they will be allowed to go to the DRC.

All of these people will be tested for Covid-19 as per existing protocols. Similarly, people arriving on special trains and Shramik special trains will also be sent to the district reception centre.
