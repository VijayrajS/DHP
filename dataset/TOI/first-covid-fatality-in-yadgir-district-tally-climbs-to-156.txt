YADGIR: Against a backdrop of rising Covid-19 cases in Yadgir, where 16 more individuals were confirmed infected on Wednesday, the district reported the first casualty to the pandemic. A 69-year-old woman who had collapsed during the screening process while entering the state from neighbouring Maharashtra, and had been declared ‘dead on arrival’ when taken to the hospital, was later confirmed to have had Covid-19 infection. 

The officials decided to have her throat swabs tested since she had come to Karnataka from Maharashtra.

In the past week, with nearly 15,000 people returning to Yadgir from neighbouring states, the district has seen a spurt in the tally. In Bidar and Raichur, two other districts in North Karnataka that have registered a huge influx of returning residents, 13 and five cases were reported on Wednesday.
