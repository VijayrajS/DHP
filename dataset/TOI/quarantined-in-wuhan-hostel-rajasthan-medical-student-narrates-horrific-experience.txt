JAIPUR: One of the seven students from Rajasthan, studying in China narrated the horror of being confined in their hostel rooms for the past 10 days due to lock down in Wuhan of China amid novel coronavirus (nCoV) scare before being taken to Manesar, where he is quarantined along with others airlifted from China in the past two days. 

 They reached Delhi on Saturday after the Centre extended help and airlifted the students. "Wuhan is the city which I liked a lot. Even in winter vacations, which started from January 10, I preferred to stay back. But I never thought that I will have to remain confined to my hostel room wearing a mask all the time. Situation changed entirely in 10 days as Wuhan was under a health emergency and was completely locked down," said a medical student, who went to China in December 2018 for studying MBBS course He said that all the shops and hotels were closed. "The university in which I studied, helped us a lot. As we were confined within a room, we were facing difficulty in getting food. However, the university took the initiative and provided us food in our rooms," he said. 

 "The internet was functioning properly, and we were continuously getting news updates of deaths of people due to nCoV in Wuhan. It was quite scary. It was even more worrisome for my parents," he added. "It came as a major relief for us when we got a call from the university that we are going back to India. We reached Delhi around 7.30am on Saturday," he said. 

 His 18 colleagues from the same medical university had already arrived before the lock down in Wuhan. Including the medical students, there are 38 persons in the state who have come from China and are under the watch of the health authorities. 

A health department official said eight more have been added to the list of people coming from China to the state till Sunday night, who are kept under watch.
