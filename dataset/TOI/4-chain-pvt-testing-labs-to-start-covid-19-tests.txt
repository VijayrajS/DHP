2020-05-03
Ranchi: The state health department on Saturday said four private pathological laboratories have been authorised by ICMR to start Covid-19 tests and are expected to start operations in a couple of days. The department also said the laboratories cannot charge more than Rs 4,500 per test.

Talking to TOI, Jharkhand mission director of National Health Mission, Shailesh Chourasia, said, “We have not received the guidelines to be followed by the laboratories on collection and testing of samples from ICMR. Once we receive them, the service will be available to anyone who wants to get himself tested for Covid-19 and hopefully the guidelines will be published within a couple of days.”

He said, “To boost the state’s testing capacity, we had invited proposals for collection and testing of samples from private entities operating in Jharkhand, based on the guidelines issued by the Union health ministry and ICMR’s letter on the protocols to be followed for sample collection and testing. The four laboratories, which have chain branches across the state, expressed their interest, following which the state health department allowed them to prepare for the operations.”

Chourasia further said the authorised private laboratories are Dr Lal Path Labs, SRL limited, Core Diagnostics and Path Kind Diagnostics Limited. They will start operations in the state by implementing all safety protocols issued by ICMR and in co-ordination with state and district Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) cells, he said.

The mission director said, “The private entities have been asked to follow all safety protocols during collection and testing of samples as per the guidelines issued by ICMR. Moreover, they have to share details of sample collection and test results on a daily basis to IDSP authorities without fail and they have been allowed to charge a maximum of Rs 4,500 per test.”

Chourasia added that all four agencies have fixed the price per test at the maximum price set, citing operational costs.

He said, “The four labs said they have to collect the samples and send them to Gurugram and Kolkata for testing, thus increasing their operational costs. Moreover, they said their costs are high as their staff will use a fresh set of protective gear for every customer, apart from incurring costs for viral transport media (VTM) and sample testing kits. Hence, the government has allowed them to fixed the price at Rs 4,500 per test.”

Chourasia added that no more private labs in the state are likely to get authorisation for testing as ICMR will not be able to inspect further laboratories and provide accreditation.
