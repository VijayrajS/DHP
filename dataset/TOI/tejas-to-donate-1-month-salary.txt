He also offered his 1, Polo Road bungalow to be used as a quarantine centre or for treating patients.


“It is sad that a person in Bihar died due to coronavirus. Now is the time to come together and fight against it. The government should do away with negligence and take immediate action. In this battle, we are ready to provide all necessary support to the government,” wrote Tejashwi on his Facebook post on Monday.
