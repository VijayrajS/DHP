VIJAYAWADA: With the government set to begin lockdown 4.0 in a few days, the chief minister has asked officials to draw up standard operation procedures (SOP) to deal with the fourth phase of the lockdown.


Jaganmohan Reddy, at a review meeting on the coronavirus situation in the state on Saturday at his camp office, directed the officials take up campaign to dispel the social stigma surrounding the disease. “There is no reason to ostracise the corona positive people and this message must be driven home,” the chief minister said. Only this will encourage suspected cases to voluntarily visit hospitals and get themselves tested. This will also help the state contain the virus, he said. 



The chief minister wanted the officials, particularly the health department, to come up with pamphlets with safety tips and symptoms of coronavirus that should be distributed across the state. The pamphlet should also carry the toll-free number to which a Covid-19 positive patient and others can call for assistance. 

Referring to the proposed village clinics to be opened in the state, the chief minister wanted the officials to make corona testing equipment available in all the clinics. “The clinics in the containment zones should be equipped on a priority basis after the lockdown is lifted,” he said. 

He also directed the officials to implement the SOP in public transport, theatres, restaurants and malls once the lockdown is lifted and the markets are opened. He wanted the officials to ensure that physical distancing is strictly followed in all the public places, safety measures like wearing of mask and carrying of sanitizers are followed.

Deputy chief minister Alla Kalikrishna Srinivas, minister Kurasala Kanna Babu, chief secretary Nilam Sawhney, health principal secretary, Jawahar Reddy and others were present at the review meeting.
