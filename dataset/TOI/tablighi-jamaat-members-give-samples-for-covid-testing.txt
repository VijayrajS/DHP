Gumla: Around 60 Tablighi Jamaat members, who attended the Biharsharif Markaz in Nalanda last month, gave their blood and swab samples for Covid-19 test on Wednesday. 

Earlier, Gumla deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan had made a public appeal to Biharsharif Markaz participants to opt for voluntary testing. Mohammad Minajuddin, a member of Anjuman Islamia and a functionary of Gumla Jama Masjid, furnished the contact details of Markaz’s participants to the district administration.

Minajuddin said, “About five dozen people from Gumla had gone to Biharsharif on March 14 to participate in a Tablighi Jamaat Markaz the next day. They returned on March 16.”

The samples were collected at Anjuman Islamia hospital in Islampur. Gumla civil surgeon Dr Vijaya Vengra said, “Samples of 59 people were collected and are being sent for test to Rims in Ranchi.”
