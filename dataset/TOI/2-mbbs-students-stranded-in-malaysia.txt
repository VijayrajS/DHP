They landed in Malaysia on March 12 and were scheduled to return on April 9. Mahima said the flight booked by her to India was cancelled, after the Indian government imposed a travel ban on those coming in from Malaysia. “I wish to return home as soon as possible. There is a possibility that Malaysia likely to go under lockdown to contain Covid-19, and we will be left in the lurch,” she said. She added that the ministry of external affairs and Manipal Academy of Higher Education is trying to help them.


 KMC Mangaluru dean M Venkatraya Prabhu said that MAHE has made arrangements for students to be put up at Manipal International University, Malaysia.
