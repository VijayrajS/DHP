2020-04-06
Malda/Suri: A private hospital in Malda’s Chanchal that has been designated as a quarantine centre for Covid-19 suspects was ransacked on Sunday. 

This incident comes a day after Birbhum witnessed violence over the same issue, resulting in a death.

Dr S N Sharma, owner of Chanchal Dishari Nursing Home, said: “When the administration decided on our 30-bed hospital as the quarantine centre, we had no objections. But a few locals misunderstood the government action and unleashed their fury on us.”

Trouble began in the morning, when residents of neighbouring Raipara gathered before the nursing home and raised slogans against the quarantine centre. They alleged that residents of the area, lying 40 metres from the hospital, might get infected. While staff locked themselves in, the mob attacked the gate, dumped the furniture on the road and set fire to it, bringing police to the spot.

SDPO Sajal Biswas said: “We are trying to control the mob.” District health officials called the incident “most unfortunate”. Police patrolling is still on.

Meanwhile, seven persons have been detained over Saturday’s incident at Birbhum’s Talibpur, where one Sk Saifuddin died of bomb injuries. It is learnt that a minority girls’ hostel at Talibpur was identified as a quarantine centre, which angered locals.
