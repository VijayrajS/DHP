2020-04-21
HYDERABAD: Two persons died and 14 others tested positive for coronavirus on Monday in Telangana, the first such low numbers of Covid-19 cases in more than two weeks.


On April 1, the state reported 12 cases and since then continued to report more than 25 cases on most days.

A 72-year-old man from Adilabad died six hours after he was admitted to a hospital with comorbid conditions. Another 35-year-old woman from Rangareddy district, who had tested positive just three days ago, also died.

She was a cancer patient undergoing treatment at a corporate hospital. 

The 72-year-old is a resident of Nirmal and was admitted to a government hospital in Nizamabad before she was shifted to Gandhi Hospital.

The total number of positive cases have reached 872 and 23 people have died, while the number of those recovered remains at 186.

The government on Monday also made a crucial change in the administration. Gandhi Hospital superintendent Dr Sravan Kumar was appointed Telangana coordination officer for coronavirus. In his place, Dr Raja Rao from the same hospital was appointed superintendent of Gandhi Hospital. 

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) continues to report a high number of cases with 12 of 14 cases on Monday. Medchal and Nizamabad districts reported one case each.

Meanwhile, state health minister Eatala Rajender spoke to Union MoS for health Aswini Kumar Choubey, seeking immediate supply of 1,000 ventilators to the state as promised.

Local authorities said that since the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) will begin operations in Gachibowli, these ventilators are required there. 

Eatala said that despite the Centre promising N95 masks and PPEs, they have not reached the state. 

“If the state buys them it will cost us more, if the Centre supplies, the burden will be eased” he told the Union MoS.
