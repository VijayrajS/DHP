DEHRADUN: The total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Uttarakhand shot up to 46 on Monday after two new cases were reported in Dehradun. Additional secretary (health) Yugal Kishore Pant said that both the cases had come in contact with Tablighi Jamaat members who were tested positive earlier this month.

“Among the new cases, one is a 66-year-old man while the other patient is 29-year-old. Both had come in contact with Covid-19- positive Tablighi Jamaat members in the past,” added Pant.

Meanwhile, seven Covid-19 patients have fully recovered and were discharged from various hospitals across the state on Monday. Now, a total of 18 cases have recovered in the Himalayan state.

“Those who recovered on April 20 include two Jamaat members who were undergoing treatment at Government Doon Medical College and Hospital, three people who were admitted to an Udham Singh Nagar facility, and two others who were admitted to Susheela Tiwari Medical College in Haldwani,” added Pant.

 Uttarakhand has conducted 3,677 tests so far and over 66,000 people have been kept in quarantine at their homes or other facilities. 

Meanwhile, reacting to the rising number cases of abuse and violence against doctors and medical professionals in India, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Uttarakhand announced to observe a “Black Day” on April 23. “Additionally, the doctors will work with black badges on hands on April 23 if the government fails to enact a central law on violence against doctors,” said Dr DD Choudhary, state secretary of IMA.
