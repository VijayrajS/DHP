Harvest disruption amid lockdown in Andhra Pradesh
2020-03-30
VIJAYWADA: A farmer from Chandrayunipalli village in Andhra Pradesh has complained to the AP Lokayukta, Justice Lakshman Reddy, conveying the plight of farmers in the area, where beetroot and carrot crops are not being harvested due to a lack of skilled labourers. 


The issue has risen due to the movement restriction in light of a 21-day nationwide lockdown. A shortage of vegetables is, hence, being seen in the markets. 


 
Further, a lack of coordination between revenue, police and other government wings is resulting in scarcity of vegetables and fruits in Chintamani whole sale market that is near Chittoor but geographically falls in Karnataka. 

Scores of lorries carrying vegetables to the market are being blocked at a nearby check posts despite assurances from authorities that there is no bar on the movement of essential commodities.

Wholesale traders from several states arrive at Chintamani market to buy vegetables and fruits, that are later transported to Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai etc. With the supply chain being interrupted, wholesale fruit markets like LB Nagar in Hyderabad are also getting affected.

An artificial scarcity of supplies may result in the prices sky-rocketing.

Upon receiving the farmer’s complaint, the Andhra Pradesh Lokayukta directed Chittoor district collector to ensure ease of movement of essentials. Adequate measures to maintain social distances in the wholesale market should be taken, he said, without its complete closure.

“Officials should ensure that bottlenecks at the ground level are removed. Talk to your counter parts across the border to mitigate the difficulties of the farmers at one end and consumers on the other,” Justice Lakshman Reddy said.
