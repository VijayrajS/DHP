AGRA: More than 200 workers from various parts of Bihar were found working in Hathras’s brick kilns during lockdown on Wednesday amid coronavirus outbreak. The workers claimed that their owners had refused to pay unless they continue to work at the unit.


Talking to media, one of the workers said that they are stuck in Hathras due to the nationwide lockdown and the kiln owner has refused to pay them without work. “We have to feed our family, so we need to work,” said the workers. On being asked if they had been provided masks or sanitiser, one of the workers said that “nothing had been given by the owner”.

Another worker said that almost 200 families are working in the units in the area. “We don’t have a choice but to work as we are daily wagers and have no other place to go. We feed our families what we earn every day. If we don’t work, how can we survive,” he said, adding that he belongs to Bihar and cannot even go back to his village now.

“Sarkar ko humare bare me kuch to sochna chahiye. Kaise jiyenge? Bacche kaise palenge? [How will we feed our children? How are we going to survive? The government must think about us too],” they said.

When contacted, one of the brick kiln owners Rajesh Chaudhary claimed that workers were only picking up bricks from there but no new production work was being carried out. “We will not allow anyone to work there,” he said, adding that these people can’t go anywhere and so staying there.

District magistrate Hathras, Praveen Lakshkar, said that they have received information and are looking into the matter and assured that strict action will be taken against the kiln owner for violating the lockdown.

Around 30 brick manufacturing factories exist in Hathras and almost six were operational in Tehsil Sadar on Wednesday.
