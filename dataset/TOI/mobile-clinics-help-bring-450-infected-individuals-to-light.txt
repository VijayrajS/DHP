Pune: Mobile clinics help bring 450 coronavirus infected individuals to light
2020-06-11
PUNE: Every day around 10am when Prachi Deshpande, a doctor associated with a mobile clinic for screening suspected Covid-19 patients, slips into her personal protection gear she knows that she has to keep it on for the next 6-8 hours or even beyond.

As long as she is on the road screening suspected positive patients, she cannot use the washroom. So, she avoids having even a sip of water till she calls it a day. This has been a daily routine for her as well as for around 100 people attached with the mobile clinics of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the last two months. 

The untiring work of these medical staffers has helped in detection of over 450 positive cases, said civic officials. 

 On an average, the mobile clinics screen around 8,000 people daily. "These clinics have been operating in containment as well as in non-containment zones since April," said Vaishali Jadhav, a senior health official of PMC.
