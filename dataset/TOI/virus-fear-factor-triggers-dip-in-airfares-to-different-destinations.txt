Coronavirus fear factor triggers dip in airfares to different destinations
2020-03-14
PUNE: Businessman Rajeev Sontake was surprised while booking a flight ticket to Bengaluru.


“A one-way ticket for Bengaluru for the weekend was priced between Rs1,500 and Rs1,700 for most airlines. It is good news, but my family is against my trip. I am thinking about all aspects,” Sontake told TOI.

With Covid-19 spreading in many parts of the country, including Pune, airfares from the city to many destinations have dropped drastically. A glance at airfares revealed that a one-way ticket from Pune to Chennai was priced between Rs2,300 and Rs2,500. A ticket to Hyderabad would cost about Rs2,900-3,000 (one-way). Even a one-way flight to Goa, a popular tourist destination with heavy passenger traffic, was between Rs3,500 and Rs4,000.

A Pune-Jaipur ticket was available within Rs4,000. A one-way ticket to Delhi would be Rs3,000. The one-way Dubai “deal” is simply alluring: Rs6,800.

Aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar said, “Many people have put travel plans — vacations or business — on hold because of the fear factor. They want things to settle down before travelling. The virus has spread through air travellers in maximum cases and so, the airlines are feeling the impact.”

Nilesh Bhansali, the director of Travel Agents’ Association of Pune, said, “Things are not good at present. It is our request to customers and passengers not to panic and not to believe in rumours. They should wait and watch.” 

Different airlines have announced sops for flyers in the wake of Covid-19 spread. SpiceJet has posted on its Twitter handle that it would not charge any fees for existing bookings for travel between March 12 and 31 as well as on new bookings during the same time.

GoAir said it would not charge any fee on cancellation and rescheduling of tickets booked till April 30. This applies to bookings made between March 8 and April 30 for the travel period from March 8 to September 30.

IndiGo, too, has said it would not charge any fee for rescheduling of flights booked between March 12 to March 31. The airline in a statement said it had seen a decline of 15-20% in daily bookings over the past few days.
