Kerala: Covid-19 boosted her confidence in life
2020-05-09
THRISSUR: It has been 100 days since India’s first Covid-19 patient was hospitalised here in the district.


Even since her discharge from hospital on February 20, the third-year MBBS student had undergone multiple tests for coronavirus. All tests returned negative results.

Testing negative repeatedly has boosted her confidence, especially since there has been reports of some patients in China testing positive again for the virus, even three months after their recovery.

The Keralite, apparently, contracted the virus from Wuhan, China, where she has been pursuing an MBBS degree. Wuhan was initially the epicentre of Covid-19.

“We are testing her occasionally, and the last test was conducted about a month ago. But she has not tested positive even once,” district medical officer Dr K J Reena said. 

The student had returned from Wuhan along with her 20 Indian collegemates on January 24. She tested positive on January 30.

The young woman said her experience as a Covid-19 patient—the isolation and treatment—has made her more confident to take on challenges life may pose.

“I’m happy that no one, including my parents and other family members, got infected from me. I’m thankful to God, doctors, nurses, paramedics and authorities for the excellent care that was given to me,” she said over the phone from her residence at Mathilakam. 

She is now attending online classes being offered by her institute at Wuhan. “It is not sure when I can return,’’ she said.#
