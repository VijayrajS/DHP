HYDERABAD: Religious leaders from various Muslim organisations have announced that they would cooperate with the state government in their attempts to check the spread of coronavirus in the state. They said that they would be restricting religious gatherings at mosques and other places.


Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, along with representatives of various Mulsim organisations, met chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao at Pragati Bhavan on Thursday evening and also thanked him for passing a resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC in the state Assembly few days ago.

Later addressing the media, Asaduddin Owaisi said combating the virus was a challenge and several measures were taken. “Whatever measures state government initiates, we will cooperate. We have cancelled all public meetings and urge Muslims to do their Friday prayers at home except some mandatory prayers,” he said.
