2020-03-19
AHMEDABAD: A day after trustees and managements of schools proposed cancellation of exams amid growing concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic, parents on Wednesday demanded the government promote all students to the next class.


All Gujarat Vali Mandal, an association of parents has written to chief minister Vijay Rupani for mass promotion of students from Class I to Class IX. The state government has ordered all schools closed from March 16 to March 29 to reduce risks of Covid-19 infections. 

The academic session is to begin by April 20 according to the state government’s directive. 

“This means that schools have only 10 days from April 1 to April 10 to conduct annual exams, following which results are to be announced.. Students can’t go to class, and there’s lot of confusion about exams. So we have requested the CM for mass promotion of students this year,” said Naresh Shah, president of All Gujarat Vali Mandal. 

The schools can re-open on April 20 for the new academic year where students would be promoted to an upper class, he added. Another association, Vidyarthi Vidya Suraksha Samiti has written to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, with similar demands. The Gujarat Rajya Shala Sanchalak Mahamandal (GRSSM) on Tuesday suggested that all students from Class 1 to Class IX be promoted to a higher classes based on their performance in half-yearly and internal exams. 

The association, which has management and trustees of schools as its members, also proposed that the new academic year, which was to begin from April 20, should be postponed to July.
