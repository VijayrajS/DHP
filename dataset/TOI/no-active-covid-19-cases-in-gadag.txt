No active Covid-19 cases in Gadag
2020-05-11
Hubballi: Close on the heels of Mysuru turning into Covid-19-free district, with all patients being discharged, Gadag has now secured a place on the list of districts with zero active cases. 

On Saturday evening, the three Covid-19 patients who were undergoing treatment at the Gadag Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) were discharged.

Gadag deputy commissioner MG Hiremath was understandably proud of the district’s handling of the pandemic. “We have been successful in preventing the spread of the pandemic in Gadag. All the 19 primary contacts and most of the secondary contacts have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. We are waiting for the results of few others,” Hiremath told TOI. 

 “The challenge confronting the district administration is to prevent fresh cases being reported in Gadag. Doctors are testing more people now, and residents displaying symptoms are being tested, and asked to isolate themselves,” Hiremath added.
