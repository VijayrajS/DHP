PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday asked all the district magistrates (DMs) and superintendents of police (SPs) to do regular monitoring of quarantine centres under their respective jurisdictions.

They have also been asked to ensure that no antisocial element try to create nuisance at the quarantine centres where returnee migrant workers have been kept for 14 days to avoid the spread of Covid-19 in the villages.

Holding a high-level review meeting with chief secretary Deepak Kumar and other senior officials here, the CM further asked the officials to strengthen all necessary arrangements at the block and panchayat-level quarantine centres in the wake of migrant workers returning in large numbers and more to come back in the coming days.

“The employees deployed at the quarantine centres should be regularly briefed by their senior officers so that there should be proper arrangements for the migrants kept in quarantine,” the CM said.

Nitish also said the state government would have to increase the number of testing facilities for Covid-19 in the wake of large number of migrant workers returning home. “We would also have to increase the number of testings per day,” he said and asked the chief secretary to take necessary action as per the Covid protocol.

The CM further directed the officials to expedite the process of issuing new ration cards to all the poor families deprived of this facility so far. He said an amount of Rs1,000 must be transferred in the bank accounts of all those families identified by the members of Jeevika self-help groups as ‘eligible to get ration card’.

Nitish asked the officials to take action against the guilty persons in case of any irregularities in distribution of foodgrains among the poor families. “Irregularities in the public distribution system (PDS) will not be tolerated,” he said.
