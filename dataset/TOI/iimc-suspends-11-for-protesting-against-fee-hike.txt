IIMC suspends 11 for protesting against fee hike
2020-02-11
NEW DELHI: Eleven students of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication on Monday were served a show-cause notice and placed under suspension for five days for “concerted acts of indiscipline” within the IIMC campus.

The protests, a public talk on affordable education, were held on IIMC campus despite repeated counselling by the administration and faculty members. The February 10 order gave time to the 11 students until 5pm on Tuesday to explain why “further disciplinary action” should not be taken against them for violating the code of conduct for students. On humanitarian grounds, however, the order said suspended students would not be asked to vacate their hostel rooms. 

Protest against hostel fee hike on the neighbouring JNU campus spread to IIMC in December last year, when students protested against the “unaffordable fee structure”. Some IIMC students also staged a strike on campus against the high tuition fee and hostel and mess charges.
