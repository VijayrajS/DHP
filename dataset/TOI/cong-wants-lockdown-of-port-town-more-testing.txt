Cong wants lockdown of port town, more testing
2020-06-08
Panaji: The state government needs to test every person in Vasco, especially Mangor Hill, and conduct random tests for Covid-19 across the state, the Congress said on Sunday. The party also called for a complete lockdown in Vasco till cases subside.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters, the party’s two district presidents also called on the state government to implement the Rs 100 crore economic stimulus package outlined by opposition leader Digambar Kamat.

“The first request of ours is that Vasco should be locked down because cases are increasing everyday at Mangor Hill,” said South Goa Congress president Joe Dias. “The government has stopped testing at Vasco, I request the government to ensure complete community testing in Vasco and Mangor Hill. At the same time, in Goa, random testing has to be done.”

Reacting to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s statement that 80% of the state’s revenue has been lost, the Congress also demanded that the government reduce the size of the cabinet to five ministers to cut down on expenses. “There are many corporations that are not doing much and these should be suspended or temporarily closed. There are consultants and advisors for every department who charge lakhs, they should be removed or suspended till the economy improves,” said North Goa district president for the Congress, Vijay Bhike. 

Pointing out that panic is setting in across the state due to the rising cases, the Congress questioned the state’s haste in allowing restaurants, religious places and malls to open up. It has also decided to provide essential food items to Mangor locals if the state does not meet its promise.
