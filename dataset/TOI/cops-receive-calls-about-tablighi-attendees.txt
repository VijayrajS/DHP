GREATER NOIDA: While the contact chain of the Tablighi Jamaat attendee in Dadri who tested positive is being traced — 12 people have been quarantined so far — cops are receiving calls about people thought to have returned from a jamaat.

On Sunday, labourers spotted a group of six moving towards Loni. They returned from Hyderabad and locals thought they were from a jamaat. “But they were labourers from Loni who worked in Hyderabad,” the SHO of Dadri said.TNN
