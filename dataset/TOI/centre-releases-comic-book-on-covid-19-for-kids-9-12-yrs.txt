Kochi: The central government has released a comic series for Covid-19 awareness ‘Kids, Vaayu & Corona: Who wins the fights?’ to spread awareness among children in the age group of 9-12 years.

The book is by the faculty of PGIMER-Chandigarh and Panjab university-Chandigarh to help children get answers to their queries on coronavirus. The book is authored by Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor, environment of health, PGIMER, and Dr Suman Mor, chairperson, department of environment studies, Panjab university, and with technical support from National Centre For Disease Control (NCDC).

Vaayu is a global citizen who lives at the foothills of Himalayas and a superhero who works for better health and environment. He has been called to fight the global threat of coronavirus and to protect children from sudden panic and fear. The comic aims to reach out to children in age group of 9-12 years. Coronavirus has become cause for concern and parents should talk to the children and resolve their queries so that they do not panic.

It starts off with kids watching TV about coronavirus. The father promises to explain it in the evening but the kids are curious and they call Vaayu for help.

Vaayu, who appears as a superhero, explains about what viruses are, and that it could spread through touch, float and move through air. “That is why doctors and teachers always advise to cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough,” Vaayu says.

Of course, one wonders if kids in that age group understand words like mortality. Then Vaayu goes on to explain hand-wash techniques to the children. It advices kids to greet people with a handshake and instead with As-salaam-alaikum, namastey, hello, or sat sri akal ji. One does not need to wear mask if they don’t have cold or respiratory symptoms. There are pictorial representations of 1m distance while sneezing or coughing and other instructions.
