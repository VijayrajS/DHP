2020-06-01
CHANDIGARH: While Haryana and Himachal Pradesh reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases during Lockdown 4.0, as a large number of relaxations were extended across the country, the number of new cases in neighbouring Punjab slowed down.

 


The number of Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh was also not very high between May 18 and May 30.

An analysis of data from the three states and UT revealed that Haryana received 1,01 cases, the highest number during this period. During Lockdown 3.0, which was from May 4 to 17, the state reported only 393 cases. 

There were eight deaths in the third phase of lockdown in the state, which is two more than the six deaths in Lockdown 4.0. During this period, 409 in Haryana recovered from the infection.

Lockdown 4.0 brought good news for Punjab as the number of Covid-19 cases was one-third less than in Lockdown 3.0. The numbers of deaths was also lower. It was 12 in Lockdown 3.0 and nine in the fourth phase. Around 600 people recovered in Punjab during the fourth lockdown, while the figure was 1,200 for Lockdown 3.0.

For Himachal Pradesh, the fourth lockdown only brought bad news. While the state got only 39 fresh cases during the third lockdown, the figure was 233 during Lockdown 4.0 in the hill state. There was only one death in the state in Lockdown 3.0, but there were three fatalities in the last two weeks.

The situation in Chandigarh remained constant. While there were 89 fresh cases in Lockdown 3.0, the figure was 97 for Lockdown 4.0. One death was also reported during this time. 


Combined analysis 

The three states and the UT got 1,253 cases during Lockdown 3.0 and this figure rose to 1,613 in Lockdown 4.0 â€” primarily because of a hike in cases in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. When it came to daily growth of infection, the figure was 9% for Haryana, 8% for Himachal Pradesh, and around 1% for Punjab and Chandigarh.

While 23 deaths took place during Lockdown 3.0 in the three states and UT, the number was 19 in fourth phase. Also, 1,582 persons recovered during Lockdown 3.0 in the region and the figure was 1,225 during Lockdown 4.0.
