2020-04-28
HYDERABAD: Congress MLA T Jagga Reddy on Monday suggested that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao extend the lockdown till December but after taking all measures to ensure that the poor and the other sections of society are taken care of. 


Jagga Reddy said that any decision to end lockdown may water down the efforts made by the state government against spread of novel coronavirus as mass gathering festivals are lined up. Starting with the fasting month of Ramzan followed by Eid-ul-Fitr, other festivals to follow are Bakrid, Moharram, Bonalu, Bathukamma, Dasara, to name a few. tnn
