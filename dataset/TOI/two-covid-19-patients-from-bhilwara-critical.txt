JAIPUR: A doctor and a nursing staff, who were rushed from Bhilwara two days ago to Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital in Jaipur, are on ventilator support. They were first brought to a private hospital, but later they were shifted to SMS Hospital.

They belonged to the same private hospital which has reported 11 Covid-19 cases so far in the past two days. According to SMS Hospital doctors, they have been provided with the same combination of medicines which they had provided to the Italian couple, who were cured of Covid-19. “We are giving them the same combination drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir, which are useful in HIV treatment, oseltamivir, which is useful in swine flu treatment and chloroquine useful in malaria,” said a doctor of SMS Hospital.

SMS Hospital is burdened with Covid-19 patients as it is not only taking care of patients tested positive for the disease in Jaipur but also of other parts of the state such as Jhunjhunu and Bhilwara. Currently, there are 12 patients of Covid-19, in the isolation hospital of Sawai Man Singh medical college.

The jhunjhunu couple and their daughter, who were tested positive for the disease on March 18, are also undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in the same Isolation hospital. However, the doctors claimed that their condition is stable. “We are not giving them the combination antiretroviral drugs, which is also useful in HIV treatment. These drugs are given when the patient complaint of pneumonia and when he is critical. In case of Jhunjhunu couple, we have not given them these drugs as they are stable. They are provided with oseltamivir and chloroquine,” said an SMS hospital doctor.

A board of doctors has also been constituted at SMS Hospital level which reviews the condition of the patients on daily basis.
