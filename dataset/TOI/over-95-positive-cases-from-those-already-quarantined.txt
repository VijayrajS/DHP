Aurangabad: Cell tower tracing clubbed with large-scale contact tracing and testing has ensured that over 95% of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 10 days were quarantined by Aurangabad authorities much before their reports were generated.Starting from April 27, Aurangabad has started witnessing registration of Covid-19 positive cases in two digit numbers each day. Almost all of them are from those who are already put under institutional quarantine. Aurangabad’s success rate of quarantining possible suspects before they test positive has been good. The authorities concluded that the successful contact tracing and large scale testing of primary as well as secondary contacts has not only prevented further spread of the infection to a considerable extent, but also identified a large number of silent careers. The state has already taken cognizance of the ‘Aurangabad pattern’ which is likely to be considered for implementation in the red as well as orange zones across Maharashtra.Till Saturday evening, the total number of Covid-19 positive patients in Aurangabad reached 244.It all started with the revenue divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar ordering large scale testing of all possible apartments and houses in a given locality of a containment zone in addition to primary and secondary contact tracing of every person testing positive for Covid-19.Working on the lines, Aurangabad municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey hand-picked 12 members, including two cyber crime experts provided by the city police. Thereafter, a special task force (STF) was formed on April 22.When contacted, Pandey said, “In the past 10 days, our STF has managed to contact trace almost every person that might have come directly or indirectly in contact with a Covid-19 positive patient. As a result, over 90% who ended up getting tested positive for the infection were already quarantined.” Following the standard operating procedure, the STF is amongst the first to receive Covid-19 test reports of all the patients from the Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad-based Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL). The information also reflects on a dashboard provided to the STF.
