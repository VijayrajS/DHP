MEERUT: A woman took to Twitter to narrate “pathetic” condition of a quarantine facility in UP’s Khurja town where she claimed that 20 Covid-19 suspects were crammed into a room along with her husband and two minor daughters. The woman, who is now at her parents’ home in Greater Noida, claimed in a series of tweets that her husband and two children were also not getting proper food at the shelter home in Bulandshahr’s Khurja town.


“The condition of this quarantine centre is very pathetic. It has 20 suspects crammed in a single small room, and chances are very high that the disease will spread among them if anyone is infected. Garbage is also strewn all over,” she said while tagging the PMO and the UP chief minister.

Her husband was put under quarantine after he drove a doctor from Shikarpur to Bulandshahr. The doctor died at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on Friday due to novel coronavirus infection.

“The doctor was the friend of my neighbour. He had fainted and required immediate medical attention. That is why I drove him in my car to Bulandshahr. After that we were brought to this Khurja shelter home,” the husband told TOI over phone.

A day after the tweets, which were later deleted, the administration swung into action.

“Help has come to us. Health department has sent people to clean and sanitise the room. This is all we wanted and there is no other complaint that we have to make,” he said, adding, “As of now, there are 13 people in the hall.”

When contacted, Dr KN Tiwari, Bulandshahr’s chief medical officer (CMO), said, “We saw the complaint and a team for sanitisation of the shelter home was sent. All the beds inside the shelter home, which is a huge hall, are kept at a distance of two metre. So there is no risk of spreading of infection among the suspects.”
