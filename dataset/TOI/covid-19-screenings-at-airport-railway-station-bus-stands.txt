2020-03-08
AURANGABAD: Local health authorities, in a response to reports of positive coronavirus cases from various parts of the country, have now installed a screening centre at the Aurangabad airport. 


Screening measures at the Aurangabad railway station too are set to start over the next three to four days, officials said.

On Friday, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) started a coronavirus screening centre at the airport, with help from United Ciigma Hospital. All flyers are now required to undergo screening. According to airport director D G Salve, passengers coming in from abroad are already being screened at the international airports. “But as a preventive measure, we have started a secondary screening process at the Aurangabad airport. Passengers have been cooperating with the screening,” he said. 

The AMC is expected to initiate the screening for the coronavirus for railway passengers from Sunday. However, according to mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, the railway authorities have not been cooperating with the AMC. When asked about the arrival of the Deccan Odyssey train at the Aurangabad railway station on March 13 — the train is expected to have around 50 to 60 foreign nationals — Ghodele said the screening centre at the station is expected to start before the arrival date. 

Officials said the AMC is also keeping an eye on people coming into the city by road from Shirdi, Nashik, Pune and Mumbai.
