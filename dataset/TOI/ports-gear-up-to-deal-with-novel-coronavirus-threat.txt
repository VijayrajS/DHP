Ahmedabad: Gujarat, which handles about a third of the country’s sea cargo, has begun taking precautions to combat the deadly novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreak in China that has spread to a few other countries.The Gujarat Maritime Board, the state’s maritime regulator, has put in placing screening, detection and quarantine systems at all minor ports for disembarking seafarers or passengers and regular reporting using thermal scanner screening, said sources. “As Kandla and the state’s minor ports receive many ships, crews and passengers from China, Hong Kong and Singapore, the health ministry has asked that all points of entry, including ports and airports, be on alert to prevent the virus contagion in India,” sources added. The secretary of the shipping ministry met senior officers of all state governments and state maritime boards on Thursday, to review measures taken by ports. GMB chief nautical officer Capt A B Solanki told TOI over the phone that the Kandla Port Health Organization (PHO) has issued an advisory to all stakeholders, including pilots, customs and immigration officials and ship masters, demanding strict compliance. No vessel will be allowed without clearance from the PHO, he added.The advisory deals with pre-arrival screening, grant of ‘pratique’, and suspected crew management, among others. “All GMB port offices have been instructed to procure 200 N-95 masks and thermal portable scanners for screening of coronavirus,” Solanki said.
