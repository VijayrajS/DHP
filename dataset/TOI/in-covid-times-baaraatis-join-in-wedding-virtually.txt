2020-06-18
Nagpur: In what may be the new normal, a ‘baaraat’ or marriage party of around 10 persons physically attended a marriage travelling from Nagpur to Bharuch in Gujarat recently while remaining were ‘present’ at the ceremony virtually as the wedding was live streamed across various social media platforms.

The groom’s family members and many from bride’s side showered their blessing and congratulations on the newly wed on the live platforms. Pleasantries too were exchanged among each other through messages and emojis as Covid outbreak seem to be changing the big fat Indian wedding into a more cost-effective and moderate affair. 

Pankaj Amesar tied knot with Ankita on Sunday after going from Chhapru Nagar in city to Bharuch in a bus with a handful of close family members to maintain Covid distancing. The family did not wanted to postpone the marriage date for various reasons including their belief in ‘auspicious’ time. 

Pankaj’s elder sister Jyoti, who is settled in Nashik, said she too wanted to attend her only brother’s wedding but felt it was moral responsibility to ensure safety. “We could have got emotional and attended the marriage with family and children but that would mean exposing ourselves to the Covid threat and hence watched it live. Feelings were as warm as if we were there but more concerned about the society,” she said. 

Jethanand Khandwani, who also watched his nephew’s marriage online, said it was time to restrict our emotions and feelings and think about the society more. “Pankaj wanted a grand ceremony. We may hold it later after the pandemic subsides but this is the time to be more restrained. We wanted the marriage to be held as an example to all with minimum guests and formalities but no dearth of feeling good,” he said.

“We also managed to save cost involved in the marriage that we can now use in a more productive way and wait for a better time to party,” said Khandwani.
