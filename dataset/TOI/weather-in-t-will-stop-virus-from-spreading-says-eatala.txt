HYDERABAD: Health authorities are confident that the high atmospheric temperature in the state will halt the virus from spreading. “Since we have high temperatures in Telangana, it will not be possible for the virus to spread easily. The virus is currently not endemic to our country and state. Only professionals and students travelling to affected countries have a chance of contracting the virus,” said health minister Eatala Rajender.


Urging people not to panic, the health minister said: “The state government has been on high alert for Coronavirus and surveillance measures are in place to contain the spread locally. There is no need to panic.” He added that those patients who had tested positive for the virus in the country so far have made a recovery. “We are positive that the patient in Hyderabad will also recover. His condition is currently stable,” Eatala said.

 
 
The novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) is a highly contagious virus and has no known cure as of now. Only symptomatic treatment is given to patients and prevention is the only way to contain the spread of the virus. “We are in touch with the Kerala government and other states wherever positive cases have been detected previously. We are actively exchanging notes on the control and treatment measures,” the health minister said.

Meanwhile, the state health department has advised people to adhere to health advisories issued by the government. “Public should follow the cough etiquette by covering the face using handkerchief / towel while sneezing / coughing. Do frequent handwashing with soap and water. Those who have arrived from Coronavirus affected countries should remain under strict home isolation for 28 days from the date of arrival in India irrespective of whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic,” the health department said in a statement on Monday.
