2020-05-09
HYDERABAD: Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay on Friday termed K Chandrasekhar Rao a “quarantine chief minister”. He said KCR appears before the public once in a blue moon. Addressing the media, Sanjay said KCR is under the illusion that he is the only CM who can get things done despite Centre’s support to each state in all possible means.


“He thinks he is not responsible to the public. He does not have any respect for opposition parties. He appears once in a while to please public like a quarantine CM,” Sanjay said.
