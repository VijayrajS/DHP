MANGALURU: Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh said there is no need for people to panic about coronavirus. 

Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat CEO R Selvamani said IEC programmes will be held to create awareness on possibilities of spread of diseases. 

 He also advised people not to follow blindly the advisories being shared on social media without proper verification. 

“Posts on cures for coronavirus which are not scientifically proven are being shared on social media. Do not follow such advisories without verifying facts,” he said. 

DHO Dr Ramakrishna Rao said there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for coronavirus infection. Supportive care for infected people can be highly effective, he said, adding that there is no vaccine available for coronavirus. 

He also advised people to take precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. 

“Wash your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitiser. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick, and cover your mouth when you cough or use a tissue while sneezing. Throw the used tissue in the dustbin. Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently,” Dr Rao said.
