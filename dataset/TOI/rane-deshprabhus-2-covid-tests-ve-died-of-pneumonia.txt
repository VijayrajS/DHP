PANAJI: Putting to rest rumours over the death of Congress leader Jitendra Deshprabhu, health minister Vishwajit Rane on Wednesday morning said that Deshprabhu, who passed away on Tuesday, died of pneumonia and that two Covid-19 tests carried out on him had given negative results.


“As health minister I take full authority of my statement that Deshprabhu died from pneumonia. I would like to reiterate that his (first) Covid-19 test was done through the virology laboratory at GMC, rapid testing was not used in his case,” Rane said.

The second test was done through SRL Diagnostics, which is a government of India-recognised laboratory. Both tests were negative for Covid-19, Rane said. 

Deshprabhu, who was rushed to GMC in a breathless state on Tuesday from a private hospital, died around 4.30pm the same day. The doctors gave his cause of death as pneumonia. Nonetheless, doubts were raised.

“The tests are still in the possession of GMC. I request people to refrain from spreading false news and indulging in rumour mongering through social media,” Rane said.

The health minister said it was unfortunate that “we lost him due to pneumonia. May his soul rest in eternal peace. Let’s all pray in such a time to give his family (strength) to overcome the loss”.

The last rites of the two-time MLA were performed in his hometown Pernem, on Wednesday morning.
