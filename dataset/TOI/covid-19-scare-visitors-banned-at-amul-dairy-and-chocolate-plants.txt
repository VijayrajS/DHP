Anand/Vadodara: Amul, nation’s largest food brand, will not allow visitors at its dairy and chocolate plant in Anand till further notice. The decision was taken on Wednesday in wake of COVID-19 cases being reported in the country.

The dairy giant encourages people to visit its dairy and chocolate plants to bring awareness about the processing of milk and milk products. On an average 3,000 visitors come to the Amul Dairy and Amul Chocolate plant in Anand daily.

A communique stated that the temporary closure is being taken as a preventive measure in accordance to an advisory released by the Government of India against public gatherings to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus infection. 

Amul also assured that the outbreak will not affect quality and supply of milk and milk products which are prepared at Amul’s 80 state-of-the-art dairy plants located across India. The release added that all products undergo stringent quality checks at each stage — from procurement of raw milk to processing into various milk and milk products and distribution to the customer.
