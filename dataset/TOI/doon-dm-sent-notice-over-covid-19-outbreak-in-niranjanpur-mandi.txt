2020-06-09
DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava seeking a report on the alleged negligence in the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak at the Niranjanpur Sabzi Mandi. The move comes after the body received a complaint in this regard by a social activist on June 2. DM Srivastava has been asked to submit his response on the issue before September 14.

Bhupinder Kumar, the activist who filed the complaint, has alleged that the mandi chairperson didn’t make any effort to get the sellers tested for Covid-19 after the first positive case surfaced in the market on May 21. “Even after the mandi secretary's direction on May 26 asking officials to get every trader tested, no action was taken. As a consequence, we are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases across Dehradun. Additionally, vegetables have been sold to city residents by these infected vegetable sellers putting the entire population at risk,” added Kumar. 

The mandi, which has reported 32 Covid-19 cases so far, has been sealed till June 11. 

Meanwhile, Vijay Thapliyal, secretary of mandi council, told TOI that there is a very high probability that sellers got infected from truck drivers coming from states like Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Hyderabad.
