2020-04-09
HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is partnering with Micron India to fight the coronavirus pandemic in the state. The company on Wednesday announced that it is donating Rs 7.5 crore towards fighting Covid-19 in India, most of which will be spent in Telangana since a majority of the company’s workforce is located in Hyderabad.


Speaking to TOI, Anand Ramamoorthy, MD of Micron India, said, “Given the scale and enormity of the task, we are immediately accelerating our efforts to provide funding, resources and support to those most affected by this crisis.” Ramamoorthy said they have also placed an order for 100 high-end ventilators for Telangana.

He said they have been in touch with CMO and IT minister’s office on how to help battle the virus through a multi-pronged approach. Micron had formed a task force last week comprising members from finance, engineering, sales and other wings to work with partner agencies on a daily basis.
