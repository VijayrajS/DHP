KOLKATA: The National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) at Beliaghata will start testing patients suspected to be infected by the novel coronavirus. The first samples to be tested are likely to be that of a 31-year-old man from Asansol who had returned from Wuhan on January 15. 

The health department has kept Somnath Kar under home quarantine. Though he is asy-mptomatic, he has been asked to be confined at home for now as a precautionary measure. “The health department is in touch with him. He is absolutely asymptomatic, but we will be sending his samples to NICED in a day of two,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director, health services.

The central health ministry has asked NICED to [prepare its laboratory to test swabs and blood samples of suspected patients in the state, as well as from places in the eastern region. “Since NICED has been given this responsibility, we are in the process of preliminary validation. Once we get the green signal from NIV, Pune, we should be in a position to start testing samples,” said NICED director Shanta Dutta.

So far, NIV, Pune, has been the only centre in India that was testing samples of suspected coronavirus patients.
