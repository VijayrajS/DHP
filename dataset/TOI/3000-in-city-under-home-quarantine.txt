All the reports of Rajkot sent for tests have turned out to be negative, while one more report sent on Sunday is pending, he said. 

Total 476 people have successfully completed their quarantine period and 668 are still under home quarantine with their families. According to the civic body, there are 3,000 people under home quarantine in Rajkot city. 

“They are not infected but are potential carriers. Hence, they are under observation. If we will find any symptoms in these people they will be shifted in the isolation wards,” Agrawal said. 

RMC formed 21 teams to keep watch on the home quarantine people and police too have joined forces with the civic body teams. Agrawal also said that if anybody is found violating the home quarantine rules, FIR will be registered against them under IPC section 188. Such flouters will be forcibly shifted in government quarantine facility or isolation ward in the civil hospital, he added.
