The testing is set to be done on priority covering all contacts of Covid-19 positive patients, health workers and police personnel in containment areas. On Saturday and Sunday, 61 tests were done in Madurai district alone using these kits and all returned negative.

Rapid testing kicked off in Dindigul at Poochinayakanpatti urban primary health centre. A total of 20 health care workers were screened using the kits and all tested negative.
