BJP MLAs show ‘Covid free’ certificates
2020-03-17
Bhopal: Some of the BJP MLAs who returned for the assembly session on Monday carried health certificates that stated they were coronavirus-free.

The MP assembly has been adjourned till March 26 over Covid-19 scare — which gave a breather for the Kamal Nath led Congress government. 

Not taking any chances and apprehending that they might be quarantined, some BJP MLAs carried health certificates to the Vidhan Sabha. 

MP health minister Tarun Bhanot has stated that all people who have visited cities where Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, would undergo a health screening. 

A certification from health department of BJP-ruled Karnataka was to provide a shield from screening and possible mandatory quarantine under Congress led-MP government. On Sunday, all Congress MLAs were screened for Covid-19 at a Bhopal after they returned from Jaipur. 

Most of BJP MLAs have been staying in Gurugram for almost a week. Around 22-rebel Congress MLAs are in Bengaluru. On their return, it is expected they too would be screened for Covid-19. 

State BJP vice president and MLA Arvind Singh Bhadoria who had recently visited Bengaluru, had one such certificate. The four-line letter was issued by the BJP-ruled Karnataka government’s directorate of health and family welfare services on March 13. His name handwritten on dotted line, stated ‘This is to certify……. has NO history of contact with suspected/confirmed case of Covid-19 patient. At present he/she is asymptomatic and free from Covid-19’. It was signed by joint director communicable diseases, Bengaluru.

Health is a state subject and MP government has already given magistrate like powers to its chief medical and health officers or CMHOs. Public gathering of more than 50 people requires permission from the CMHO. Also failure to self-declare visit to Covid-19 affected cities or locations or possible infection, is now a punishable offence as per health department notification.
