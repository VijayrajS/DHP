Facilities catering to disabled concerned as donations stop due to lockdown
2020-04-20
Dehradun: Officials of several charitable facilities in the city which house disabled and mentally-ill people fear running out of funds as their institutes are largely dependent on voluntary donations which have become negligible since the lockdown began.

Most of these facilities provide services for free or for a very nominal charge and are almost entirely dependent on donations.

Cheshire Home, a facility which caters to people with special needs, situated in the Dalanwala area, is one such institution that is encountering issues due to finances since the imposition of lockdown. “At present, we have more than 60 people living full-time in our campus. As we were largely dependent on voluntary donations from outsiders, we are now facing issues. Earlier, good samaritans used to come and distribute clothes among inmates or organise meals. Many people used to come and donate some money as well. However, much of it has stopped because of the lockdown,” said Brigadier KG Behl (retired), vice-chairman of the Dehradun unit of Cheshire Home.

Officials of another similar facility, Raphael Centre, which caters to children with disabilities as well as TB patients, are facing similar issues. “Currently, we have many people with special needs and leprosy patients in our campus. We have so far not encountered any major problem as our staff is residing in the campus and has been very active. However, voluntary donations have stopped since the lockdown started. If the lockdown period continues for a long time, it will have an adverse impact on our budget,” said Priyo Lall, CEO of Raphael Centre.
