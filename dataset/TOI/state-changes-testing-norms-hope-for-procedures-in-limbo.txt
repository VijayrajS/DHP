Gujarat changes testing norms, hope for procedures in limbo
2020-05-16
AHMEDABAD: A day after TOI published a report on how hundreds of medical procedures in Gujarat are in limbo due to the lack of timely Covid-19 testing, the state government on Friday issued a notification, identifying 10 major categories for testing. 

The government however remained adamant on the clause that there would be no testing in private labs without the permission of CDHO.

The notification issued by Dr Dinkar Raval, additional director of Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Ltd (GMSCL), on Friday says that about 1 lakh procedures taking place every month in Gujarat require testing. So far, 12 private labs in Gujarat have been given permission by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

“To ensure that there is no lacunae in treatment of patients at government, private and corporate hospitals, samples of those for operation, child delivery, dialysis, invasive procedure, etc. would be able to be tested keeping in mind current scenario and ICMR guidelines,’ mentioned the notification.

The notification added that for test in private labs, the patients would have to seek permission of CDHO in respective districts. For Ahmedabad district, the deciding authority is the superintendent of GMERS Medical College at Sola.

“We welcome the move by the state government. But we hope that the permissions will be timely,” said a city-based surgeon.
