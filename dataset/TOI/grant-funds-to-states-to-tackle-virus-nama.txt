2020-03-06
Hyderabad: TRS floor leader in Lok Sabha Nama Nageswara Rao on Thursday demanded that the Centre release funds for states where Covid-19 positive cases have been reported to tackle the disease and also to take preventive measures.

Raising the issue during the question hour, the Khammam MP said the Centre should supply equipment apart from required material to the states to take on the coronavirus. “The World Bank has announced financial support to the countries to cope with the global outbreak. Similarly, the Centre should also come to the rescue of the states,” he said.

Nageswara Rao said following one positive case in Telangana, the state government had taken measures on a war-footing. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had earmarked Rs 100 crore towards coronavirus relief measures. “Apart from setting up a control room, all the district collectors have been alerted and isolation wards with 3,000 beds readied to face any eventuality,” the MP said.
