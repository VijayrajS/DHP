‘Mining transport flouts lockdown norms, will affect respiratory health’
2020-04-19
Panaji: Goa Foundation on Saturday said that the movement of mining trucks carrying ore is a misuse of the Covid-19 lockdown guidelines issued by the central government.

Reacting to media reports on the resumption of movement of trucks carrying iron ore within the state, Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares said, “This is a misuse of the Covid19 lockdown guidelines issued by the Central government ”.

 Alvares said that the lockdown guidelines allow mineral production and transportation, but only those essential to production of iron and steel within the country. Highlighting the health hazard posed by the truck movement, Alvares said, “Covid-19, the Goa government should be reminded, is a respiratory illness. By what yardstick is an activity that is closely associated with respiratory illness being allowed on Goa’s roads”?
