Aurangabad: As many as 20 policemen, including an entire detection branch of the City Chowk police station, have been quarantined after an accused they had arrested and dealt with for three days tested positive for Covid-19.

According to a police officer, the suspect was caught for illegal sale and supply of pharmaceutical drugs and he remained in the custody of the detection branch team for three days.

"Not taking any chance, all 120 policemen from the said police station have been asked to get themselves tested for Covid-19. Of these 40 policemen, including the 20 quarantined, will have to undergo special screening," the officer said.

A team — led by police sub-inspector Pravin Patharkar who heads City Chowk police station’s detection branch — in the wee hours of April 23 had nabbed a 42-year-old accused with scheduled drugs (benzodiazepines and sleeping medications).

After being arrested he was produced before the court that remanded him in three-day police custody during which he revealed the pharmacy store from where he obtained the drugs. The police team travelled all the way to Kannad with the accused and raided the pharmacy store.

After completion of the police custody, the court remanded the accused in judicial custody on Monday. As the prison administration has made it mandatory to carry out COVID-19 test of every new prisoner, a test was carried on him on Monday and the report concluded him to be positive for coronavirus on Tuesday night.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone-I) told TOI, "We have quarantined all the policemen, who interrogated the accused, carried out search at his place, travelled with him to raid the medical store and so on."

The officer informed that during the course of interrogation, social distancing was followed and use of masks and sanitizers were ensured by the policemen.

City Chowk police station inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, "20 policemen including a PSI have been quarantined, while the others are being screened as well. Another 20 policemen, including me, would undergo two consecutive tests, before a call to quarantine us is taken."

On Wednesday, police inspector DS Shingare was given additional charge of City Chowk police station.
