‘Christ’s mandate will help get rid of coronavirus scare’
2020-04-10
KOLKATA: In this existential crisis, the biggest challenge is service to humanity, following the mandate that Christ gave at the Passover Festival before the Last Supper: this was the refrain on both the online services conducted by Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of the Diocese of Kolkata (Church of North India) and Archbishop Thomas DSouza, head of the archdiocese of Kolkata (Roman Catholic Church). 


The day got its name, Maundy Thursday, for Jesus’s mandate of service, humility and love for others, explained the two church heads. Before the celebratory supper, Jesus washed and towelled his disciples’ feet in an act of servitude. “If we can follow the Christ’s mandate, we will be able to rid humanity of all sufferings, even the novel coronavirus scare,” Canning said.

With churches being shut, all important services in this Holy Week are being held online. This helped over 1 lakh parishioners of the two churches connect and pray. “We can’t go to churches like other years and so, we are giving spiritual communion from a distance. This is bound to give you freedom from the virus, too,” Bishop Canning said.

Archbishop DSouza compared the service that Jesus mandated for yeoman’s service to that given by doctors and nurses now. 

Vicar-general Dominic Gomes said he received congratulatory messages for the online masses. Bishop Canning’s Good Friday service will start at noon and Archbishop DSouza’s at 3pm.
