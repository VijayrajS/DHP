Goa Inc braces for impact of coronavirus
2020-03-21
PANAJI: Goa-Inc has been left rattled by the global spurt in Covid-19 cases. Private firms are reporting project delays and even cancellations. 


The pharmaceutical sector, which has about three month’s worth of stock of the important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is worried about the API supply chain getting affected if the spread of Covid-19 is not curtailed.

Information technology firms and manufacturing units, meanwhile, have asked employees to cancel all travel plans. Workers who have a cold and fever have been asked to stay home.

“Contracts are getting cancelled and some manufacturers are not going for full production as they depend on imports and there could be short supply of raw material,” Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar said.

While cancellation of orders has left the IT sector and pharma sector untouched, manufacturing units depending on foreign clients, or requiring components from China, remain in a precarious situation.

Chief executive officer of Umang and president of Goa Technology Association (GTA) Manguirish Salelkar said that Goa’s IT startups and IT companies have cancelled all travel plans. “The sector which will get affected is the gig economy and companies in the delivery business. Companies are giving hygiene training to staff that meet people. Hand sanitizers are being kept at different locations and all are following NASSCOM advisories,” Salelkar said.

The American College of Culinary & Language Arts (ACCLA) has prohibited students and officials from travelling to China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Spain and Germany. A Verna-based manufacturing unit which was in the midst of upgrading its machinery has had to temporarily shelve the plans as the overseas technicians can no longer travel to Goa.
