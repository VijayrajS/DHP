Thiruvananthapuram: With the Centre expecting a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country post-lockdown, the Union government is planning to increase the number of testing centres in the country to 1,500 by next month. To achieve the target, Union health ministry has authorised premier institutes to mentor testing facilities in their respective regions.

The Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology has been asked to mentor 30 testing centres in Kerala and one in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Dr Asha Kishore, director of the institute, said there is a format for applying, which includes a check list of facility, equipment, expertise, etc. “The institute can assess the facilities online and get a few trials done and the nodal officer will then certify the centre as a testing lab if satisfied,” said

All copies will have to be sent to Indian Council of Medical Research for double checking and the sites will be linked to ICMR and state networks. The state will provide personal protective equipment and reagents, among other things. The private medical colleges which are certified by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories can get approval if all requirements are met, Kishore added.

The Union health ministry has decided to increase the capacity for Covid-19 testing in all government and private medical colleges of the country on an urgent basis for ramping up testing facilities across the country by mid-May.

The state health secretaries and principals of medical colleges in all states have been informed of their mentor institutes, mostly AIIMS and medical centres of excellence. For Kerala and Andaman Nicobar, ICMR has designated SCTIMST.
