TRICHY: All the 45 residents of Karur district who have returned from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh after a pilgrimage on Wednesday underwent medical examination.


As they didnâ€™t show any symptoms of Covid-19, doctors have instructed them to be in home quarantine for 28 days and approach doctors in case of any symptoms such as fever, sore throat and breathing difficulties.

The pilgrims from Vedichipalayam village started their journey from Karur on March 6 on a hired bus to the neighbouring states. As soon as they returned on Wednesday morning, they were taken to a government primary health centre at Vangal where a medical team examined them. The bus they had travelled was sanitised with disinfectants and the pilgrims were offered hand sanitisers and mask.

They have been advised to take food that boosts immunity and maintain social distance with family members at home. Officials from the revenue department said that the 45 people would be monitored for the next one month. They are the second batch of pilgrims who have returned from pilgrimage to other states.
