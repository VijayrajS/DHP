Covid-19  scare in West Bengal: State employees’ office time cut short by an hour
2020-03-19
KOLKATA: The Bengal government has shortened the duty period of state employees by an hour, allowing people other than the emergency staff to leave office by 4pm. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee floated the proposal in order to minimize congestion at bus and train terminals as a precautionary measure when Covid-19 has entered its most crucial phase.


“We have to be cautious for the coming two weeks. We have therefore decided to allow government employees to leave office an hour ahead, at 4pm, in a bid to bring down the evening rush,” the CM said at a government programme on Wednesday while launching 173 ambulances and 20 mechanical road sweepers for handling the outbreak of the virus. 

Additional chief secretary H K Dwivedi has issued a circular announcing the rescheduled work hours till March 31. The new norm has been extended to employees in state undertakings, urban and local bodies, and is likely to take away a major portion of human traffic during the peak evening hours.

The government is also examining the rotational duty hours introduced in Calcutta HC from this week. “We are examining the system and work flow. One of our seniors has got in touch with the Chief Justice over the system’s feasibility,” a Nabanna official said.
