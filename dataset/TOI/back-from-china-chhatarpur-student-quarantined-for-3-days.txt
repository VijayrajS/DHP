A medical student in China, the boy is suffering from cold and other related symptoms. He was kept in the special ward for swine flu patients at the civil hospital of Chattarpur which was later converted isolation ward for suspected cases of coronavirus. 


A resident of Naugaon, Abhishek Rajput had returned from China on January 14. “After I returned on January 14, I caught cold. As I had returned from China, I thought it better to get myself medically examined in Naugaon. The doctors in my city sent me to the Chattarpur civil hospital,” he told the local press. 

Almost after 24 hours of isolation, Rajput went missing from the ward on Sunday triggering panic in the hospital. However, few hours later he returned to the isolation ward.

A student of final year MBBS in China, Rajput said ,”First of all, this is not an isolation ward, but swine flue ward and is so dirty that humans can’t stay here. I am absolutely normal but I have been forced to live here because of the government norms.” 

The civil surgeon of Chattarpur Dr RK Tripthi said, “He seems to be fully fit, but as precautionary measure he was kept in the isolation ward. Nasal and throat swabs and blood samples were sent to a the medical college in Sagar, which would send the samples to NIV, Pune. We kept him in isolation because we have to follow the protocol”. However, he denied that the ward is dirty. Since it is located in the old building, the whitewash on the wall may look bad but the room is clean.” 

On Monday evening, Rajput was allowed to leave the hospital with an advise to remain in isolation at his home.
