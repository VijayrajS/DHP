West Bengal: Testing spike reduces Covid rate from 6.7% to 4.8% in three weeks
2020-05-07
KOLKATA: The total number of Covid-19 cases in Bengal rose to 1,456 on Wednesday, but the percentage of people who have tested positive dipped. Even as the state ramped up testing, the current percentage of positive cases, calculated against the total number of samples tested, comes to 4.8. Though the figure is still higher than the current national average of 3.8%, as reported by ICMR, the positive percentage in Bengal stood at 6.7 till mid-April. 


“We started conducting more tests about two weeks ag. For the past few days, we have been testing anything between 2,000 and 2,500 samples daily. As a result, the number of positive cases has been on the rise. But at the same time, the rate of people testing positive is going down,” said an official at Swasthya Bhawan. Health experts pointed out that the percentage of positive cases would keep declining as more samples were tested a day.

Also known as test positivity rate, this parameter is an indicator of the spread of an infectious disease. Even till the end of March, the number of samples the state was testing was in double digits. It was only in the beginning of April that the daily testing number started touching triple digits, about 200 on an average. The past two weeks have witnessed a major rise. “We did not start with massive testing in the initial phase. The government must have waited for a clear map of containment zones before ramping up examinations. Now with the number of tests going up, we might witness a spurt in cases in the next weeks. At the same time, it will push down the rate of positive cases being detected,” said surgical oncologist Diptendra Sarkar of IPGMER.

On April 16, when the number of samples tested in Bengal stood at 3,811 and positive cases 255, the positivity rate was 6.7%. With daily tests being scaled up to an average of 700 a day, the positivity rate gradually started to drop below 6%. “Till mid-April we had just about nine labs for Covid tests. Now we have about 16 labs and we are expecting a few more to get ICMR approval,” said a Swasthya Bhawan official.

“We keep hearing about people trying to hide symptoms instead of approaching doctors or hospitals. This is not done,” said Sarkar. “Also, a clarity on where people should go if they have symptoms or doubts will be of immense help.”
