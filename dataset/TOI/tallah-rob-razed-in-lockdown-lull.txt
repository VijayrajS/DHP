Tallah ROB razed in lockdown lull
2020-04-30
KOLKATA: Eastern Railway (ER) utilized the lull in train movement during the lockdown to dismantle the Road Overbridge (ROB) across the railway tracks at Tallah. While freight trains are plying, passenger services have been suspended. 


With fewer trains using the tracks under the ROB, it was easier to raze the whole structure by Monday, an official said. Plying of vehicles across the Tallah Bridge had been suspended months before the lockdown was enforced. “The ROB was located between the Tallah and Bagbazar stations of circular railway. It had eight spans over the railway land, which had 38 shallow Pre-Stressed Concrete (PSC) girders interlaced together, save for Span 7. This span was a reinforced cement concrete (RCC)/masonry structure. It took considerable effort on the part of ER engineers and construction workers to dismantle the structure. Though passenger services are suspended, goods and parcel express trains are running 24x7 to maintain the supply chain of essential commodities all across the country,” said the official.

Before dismantling of the bridge started, a taskforce comprising engineers of the state government and ER was formed. Railway engineers of this team maintained close co-ordination with state authorities to facilitate the work. ER also constructed a level crossing gate in record time to facilitate the movement of heavy road vehicles after traffic on the bridge was stopped.

“Despite restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, officials of different departments from the ER headquarters and Sealdah Division supervised the dismantling work. The railways provided all traffic and power blocks demanded by the state government. Overhead equipment was shifted or lowered to facilitate the working of cranes ,” the official added.
