2020-04-20
VISAKHAPATNAM: Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts will receive around 15,000 rapid testing kits from South Korea in the next couple of days, said minister of roads and buildings Dharmana Krishna Das.

The minister said he would hold talks with concerned departments about the allocation of rapid testing kits to north-coastal AP. The state government recently received one out of 10 lakh rapid testing kits ordered from South Korea.

“The government has so far decided to send around 5,000 rapid testing kits each to Srikakulam and neighbouring districts in the first stage. Later, the government would send more rapid testing kits depending on the demand,” Krishna Das said.

Though Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts have not registered any Covid-19 cases so far, the government intends to cover all suspected areas and persons using rapid testing kits that give results within 10 minutes, the minister added. 

The minister further said Andhra Pradesh stands second in the country in successfully conducting tests. 

“Earlier, Andhra Pradesh was in fourth place in screening the suspected cases, now it is in second place. We will make the state top in the country in successfully screening cases and covering all areas across the 13 districts,” Krishna Das said.
