2020-04-30
MARGAO: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has objected to forcing Goans entering the state to compulsorily go for paid quarantine in a hotel in Panaji and demanded that it be made optional for those who wish to pay for some better facilities.

Calling such forcible action as “nothing but loot of the common man,” said AAP convener Elvis Gomes. 

Stating that AAP would write to the ministry of home affairs, Gomes said, “The government is ordering quarantine and on the top of it, forcing people to pay. I don’t think it is fair especially for the poor” said Gomes. 

He said that for those who test negative, home quarantine should be allowed.
