2020-05-17
PANAJI: Goa governor Satya Pal Malik on Saturday extended his full-fledged support to the Pramod Sawant-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in handling of the Covid-19 crisis and urged the opposition and other stakeholders to come together in battling the pandemic.


Malik was reacting to the demand of opposition asking him to take over the reins of the state even as its alleged the failure of chief minister Sawant in handling the Corona pandemic.

“Only by coming together, the crisis situation can be tackled,” Malik said.

Governor took strong exception to media reports wherein the opposition sought his intervention terming Sawant-led government “defective in handling Corona pandemic.”

Malik said that the reports in various newspapers were bad in taste as it portrayed differences between him and the chief minister over handling Covid-19 crises.

Governor stated that the entire administration is under the able and efficient leadership of the chief minister, who is handling the unprecedented crisis effectively with great degree of professionalism, sensitivity and empathy.

“The stringent lockdown measures and the protocols that have been adopted by the state government are among the best in the country. It is because of these measures, there is neither any local nor community transmission of Covid-19,” he said.

A day after Goa reported eight novel coronavirus cases, Congress had said that Sawant’s handling of the pandemic was “defective” and required governor’s intervention.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar had said that everything ranging from thermal guns to rapid testing kits and the pandemic management process turned out to be defective, which is why Goa once again had active Covid-19 cases.

“The responsibility of this new development is completely on Sawant,” Chodankar had said.
