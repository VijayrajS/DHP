Home quarantine for Maharashtra returnees reduced to seven days
2020-06-09
BENGALURU: People returning from Maharashtra will be sent to seven days of institutional quarantine followed by seven days of home quarantine, according to a revised SOP issued by the Karnataka government on Monday.

Earlier, Maharashtra returnees had to go for 14 days of home quarantine after their institutional quarantine.

Also, the government has empowered the deputy commissioners of the districts to assess the effective quarantine of interstate travellers and switch between home to institution as they deem fit. They need to keep the state surveillance unit in the loop. 

Business travellers coming from other states to Karnataka are required to produce a negative Covid-19 report if they are staying for 2-7 days in the state. Till the test result comes, they will be in institutional quarantine. “If the visitor is coming for a short duration of 48 hours (counted from the arrival time) then s/he is exempted from Covid-test and quarantine,” it reads.

There will be no hand stamping for business travellers.

Business travellers going from Karnataka to other states and returning within four days need not undergo testing or quarantine on return.

The person has to report to Apthamitra helpline (14410) for 14 days and update health status for 14 days. For those returning after four days, quarantine norms will be applicable.
