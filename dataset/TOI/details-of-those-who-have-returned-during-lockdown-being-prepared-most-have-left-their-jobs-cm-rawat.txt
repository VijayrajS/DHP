DEHRADUN: The state government is preparing a detailed report of the locals who returned to Uttarakhand from various states during the ongoing lockdown, CM Trivendra Rawat said during a digital press conference on Wednesday. 

He added that te returnees would be offered loans and grants under the Chief Minister Swarozgar Yojana. As many as 125 different sectors have already been identified under the scheme which is meant to boost reverse migration, he added.

The CM said that till date, around 2 lakh people have returned to Uttarakhand. “Majority of the returnees had gone out of work in other states.

A detailed compilation of their educational qualification, skills, training sessions attended, address, and PAN number is being done,” CM Rawat said adding that self-employment schemes prepared for the returnees will encourage youths, especially in the hills, to start work in the sectors of their choice. 

“In addition to this, we are soon going to announce a major tourism project soon. We have developed growth centres to train youths in different sectors and are encouraging them to opt for the agriculture and horticulture sector. We are confident of a positive response,” said the CM. As for the Char Dham Yatra, the CM said that it would start for the pilgrims on June 8. “However, the number of tourists would be restricted to ensure that social distancing, sanitisation, and other precautionary norms are maintained. It is too early to take a call on tourists from other states. We will take decisions after considering the developments in the future,” said the CM. 

He did not fail to mention that in the first year of PM Narendra Modi-led government’s second tenure at the Centre, many key decisions have been taken. “Most of them have directly or indirectly benefited the people of Uttarakhand,” he added.
