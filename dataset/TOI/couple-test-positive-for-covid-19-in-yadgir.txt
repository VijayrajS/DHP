Yadgir: A couple tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the district, which until now was in the green zone, with no cases.

The 33-year-old woman and 38-year-old man, from Sohrapur taluk, had arrived in the district after visiting their relatives in Ahmedabad in Gujarat, on May 9. The couple, along with a family member, had travelled to Ahmedabad in March, and were stuck there, due to the lockdown. 

Deputy commissioner Kurma Rao said that they travelled in a truck from Ahmedabad, and alighted at Hunagund in Bagalkot district, on the national highway. From there they came directly to a fever clinic at Sohrapur, in a private car. Four of them, including a car driver, were under institutional quarantine since their arrival, and their throat swabs were collected for testing. The couple tested positive, and have been quarantined in a hospital. 

The district administration clamped section 144 of the CrPC in the district on May 9, following a large influx of migrant workers from other states. As many as 1,900 people have arrived from Maharashtra, Telangana and other states. They have all been quarantined in government facilities. The police were seen closing shops and business establishments on Tuesday, and forcing people to stay at home. 

From Wednesday, except for containment zones, the lockdown will be relaxed as per the directions of the state government. However, shopowners will be asked to give an undertaking stating that they will wear masks and maintain social distancing.
