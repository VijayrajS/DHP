Gandhinagar: The Gujarat government, in a detailed note sent to the government of India, has suggested resumption of almost all economic activities in the fourth phase of the lockdown that will come into force from May 18. In its representation, the state government has also recommended resumption of some activities in areas marked as red zones as well.

Providing its input for guidelines during lockdown 4.0, the state government has suggested several relaxations in the cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot.

A key source in the government said that keeping in mind the looming economic crisis in the state because of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, the Gujarat government has requested the Centre to allow normal economic activities with stringent safety guidelines. “The state government has opined that even in cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot, only some wards should be notified as red zones, while regular economic activity can commence in orange and green zones of these cities,” the source said.

Top officials said that according to the proposals sent to GOI, all religious social and political gatherings will not be permitted during lockdown 4.0. “While multiplexes will remain shut, shops located within malls will be allowed to resume with reduced staff and stringent safety guidelines,” said officials.

The state government has proposed that small shops and establishments be allowed to remain open even in red zones for a limited time.
