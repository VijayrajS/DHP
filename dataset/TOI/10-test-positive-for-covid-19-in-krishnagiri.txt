COIMBATORE: Ten people tested positive for Covid-19 in Krishnagiri on Sunday, taking the total count in that district to 20. All the 10 are close contacts of the two women, who tested positive for the virus in Shoolagiri panchayat a few days ago. 


The new patients comprise a family of four – a 37-year-old man, his 33-year-old wife, 14-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son – and six of their neighbours – a man and five women. 

In six days, 20 people have tested positive for the infection in Krishnagiri, which was in the green zone until last week. Health officials have sealed the localities, from where the new cases have surfaced, to contain local transmission of the virus. 

Meanwhile, 52 people reached Coimbatore from Maldives on Sunday. They were put in a quarantine facility in the district. They were brought by sea route to Kochi from where they were taken to Coimbatore in a special bus that was arranged by the state government. 

While three of them are from Coimbatore, the remaining are from Trichy, Erode, Dindugal, Ranipet and Karaikal. tnn
