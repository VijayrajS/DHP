PATNA: City hotels, including the luxurious ones, can be used as quarantine centres, Patna DM Kumar Ravi said after a meeting with representatives of hotels on Tuesday. “They are ready to help,” he said. “We have instructed them to clean their premises and be ready,” he said and added that around 70 such hotels have been listed for the purpose.


Ravi said the administration will bear the cost incurred during the quarantine period. “We will also give some amount to these hotels to provide three-time basic food. As of now, all the hotels are shut. If we use their premises, they will also get certain amount,” he added.

However, he said presently it is not needed as there are sufficient beds for Covid-19 suspects. “Around 40 people are already quarantined in Hotel Patliputra Ashok. Even Youth Hostel and Patliputra Sports Complex have been made ready as quarantine centres,” he said.

On March 28, the district administration had a similar meeting with representatives of private schools and many had given permission to use their premises.

Talking about migrant workers coming back to their native places, Ravi said local police stations have been instructed to support them with food and basic needs. “We are already running a community kitchen for this purpose and some 3800 packets were distributed among the migrants as well as local daily wagers and those staying in the slums,” he added.
