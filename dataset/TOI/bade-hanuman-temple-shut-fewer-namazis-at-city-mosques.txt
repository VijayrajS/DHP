Coronavirus outbreak: Bade Hanuman temple shut, fewer namazis at mosques in Allahabad
2020-03-21
PRAYAGRAJ: The management of the Bade Hanuman Mandir in Sangam has decided to keep the temple out of bounds for devotees for the next three days, beginning Friday, following a report published in TOI highlighting crowding on the premises amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. 

“Keeping the interest of the nation and the devotees first, we have decided to keep the temple gates closed till March 22. If the situation doesn’t get better, we may extend the duration of closure,” said mahant Narendra Giri, president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, adding that the temple might be shut for Navratri as well. 

Two prominent city mosques — the Shia Jama Masjid at Chak (Zero Road) and Masjid Khadija in Kareli — suspended Jumma namaz this week and for next Friday too. However, the faithful thronged several other mosques for prayers. For instance, Jama Masjid at Chowk saw over 500 people offer namaz.

Acting on the virus threat, the district administration has shut down prominent green lungs in the city, including Company Garden (Chandrashekhar Garden), Sumitra Nandan Park (Hathi Park) and Bharadwaj Park, in the past 48 hours.
