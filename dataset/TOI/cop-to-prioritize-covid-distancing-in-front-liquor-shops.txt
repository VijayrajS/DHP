2020-05-11
Nagpur: Police have prepared their blueprint to maintain discipline outside the liquor shops once they are opened in the city prioritizing ‘Covid distancing’.Maharashtra government on May 4 decided to allow liquor shops to open in some zones. The state government also had asked the police to ensure there was no ruckus outside the shops once they open.Last week, collector Ravindra Thakare and NMC chief Tukaram Mundhe decided against opening of the liquor shops in entire district citing its status as ‘red zone’ using their discretionary powers under the Epidemic Act. After Mundhe’s order, there were much deliberations over the revenue loss, possible threat over aggravating of corona spread along with questions over law and order following which Thakare too had decided against the opening of the liquor shops. The liquor merchants approached the high court against the orders to keep their outlets, including ones outside the containment zones, shut. Following the direction from the state government, the state director general of police (DGP) had issued a circular for the unit commanders to ensure there was no law and order situation outside liquor shops and also that customers followed the norms of Covid distancing.There have been several videos of chaos and long queues outside liquor shops doing rounds in social media after the outlets were allowed to function. CP BK Upadhyay said police station in-charges have been told to deploy security arrangements at liquor shops whenever they are permitted. “We will have to ensure there is discipline and Covid distancing after the liquor shops receive permissions,” he said.
