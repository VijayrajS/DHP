Chidambaram’s heroic act, Shivraj Chauhan’s bowling & Fawad Hussain’s `humen’
New Delhi: A mask drama in Parliament, social-distancing tutorials and how to be sporty during a public health crisis — Twitter continues to be a  gift that keeps on giving during this pandemic.
As the nation gears up in anticipation of Prime Minister Modi’s address tonight, Congress leader  P. Chidambaram puts forth his wish list on what it ought to contain.
What will the PM announce at 8 pm today? 
I will be disappointed if the PM did not announce a total lockdown, at least of all towns and cities, for a period of 2-4 weeks. 
Anything less will be letting down this country.
