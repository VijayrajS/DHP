Doctors in Kashmir protest over alleged harassment of healthcare professionals by police
Srinagar: Doctors at a super-speciality hospital in Shireenbagh here on Tuesday held a token protest against the alleged harassment of healthcare professionals by police in Kashmir.
The doctors were holding posters that read “they may stop us, beat us, strip us, arrest us but we will always be there for you”.
A video of Chief Medical Officer, Bandipora, Dr Tajamul Hussain being stopped by police has gone viral on social media.
The medical officer was on way to inspect a quarantine centre and sample collection centre in the north Kashmir district.
Last week, a senior doctor was allegedly humiliated and detained for a day by policemen in Srinagar while he was on way to the hospital.
Dr Syed Maqbool, a senior cardiologist, had alleged that he was beaten up and abused by the policemen.
The incident has sparked outrage in the medical fraternity with Principal, Government Medical College Srinagar, Dr Samia Rashid calling for a swift action.
