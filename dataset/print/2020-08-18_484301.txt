Bihar improves testing but still among the lowest 5, Maharashtra’s positivity rate rises
New Delhi: India crossed the 27-lakh mark in coronavirus cases Tuesday with 55,079 new cases. The last time daily cases dropped below 60,000 was on 11 August. With Tuesday’s cases, India’s Covid tally has now reached 27,02,742 cases, 51,797 deaths and 19,77,779 recoveries, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
