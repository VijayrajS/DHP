Two ThePrint journalists and driver test positive for Covid-19 in Vadodara
New Delhi: Two journalists of ThePrint, Reporter Simrin Sirur and National Photo Editor Praveen Jain, and their driver Anil Kumar, have tested positive for Covid-19 while on a reporting assignment in Vadodara, Gujarat.
They have been quarantined at a railway facility in the city and are being taken care of by authorities there. All three are asymptomatic and are doing well.
Simrin, Praveen and Anil had set out from Delhi on 11 April to cover the pandemic and travelled through Jaipur, Ajmer, Kota, Udaipur and Ahmedabad before reaching Vadodara.
ThePrint thanks the government of Gujarat and medical and district officials in Vadodara for helping Simrin, Praveen and Anil during this emergency.
We look forward to their return to the newsroom after they are cleared by medical authorities.
More than a dozen brilliant reporters and camerapersons of ThePrint have been travelling across the country for several weeks to report the coronavirus crisis from the ground like no other news organisation. We are proud of them all. You can find a selection of their work here.
