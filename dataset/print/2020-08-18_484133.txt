At 6.1%, positivity rate lowest in 2.5 months, recoveries also hit new record at 57,584
New Delhi: With almost 9 lakh tests in the last 24 hours, India’s daily positivity rate was down to a healthy 6.1% Tuesday while the number of daily positive cases showed a slight downward trend.
The case fatality rate is on its way down too, though the number of daily deaths continue to look daunting. There are wide variations both in the testing numbers of states and the case fatality rate.
With 55,079 cases reported in the last 24 hours, the total active cases in the country currently stand at 6,73,166. This is six-and-half months after the first case was reported in the country on 30 January.
In the last 24 hours, 876 people have died of Covid-19. The total death toll in the country is currently 51,797, with the case fatality rate standing at 1.92 per cent.
Between 0.8 in Sikkim and 3.51 in Gujarat, there are wide variations in the case fatality rates across the country. The target, as set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, is to bring the rate down to 1. Seventeen states have already achieved it.
India has set another record in Covid-19 tests conducted per day. Nearly 9 lakh (8,99,864) tests have been conducted in a single day, the highest tests/day so far. With this, the cumulative tests have reached 3,09,41,264. There are 755 RT-PCR-based testing labs, 604 Truenat-based labs and 117 CBNAAT-based labs.
Over the last two days, daily new cases have shown a small downward trend. Coupled with increased testing, this has brought the daily positivity rate down to 6.1 per cent. The target of 5 per cent positivity is now within touching distance.
India recorded the highest single day recoveries of 57,584 in the last 24 hours. This is higher than the confirmed cases added during the same period (55,079). With more patients recovering and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation (in case of mild and moderate cases), the total recoveries have crossed the 19 lakh mark. With this, the gap between the recovered patients and the active cases has crossed 13 lakh today (13,04,613).
The total cases in the country currently stand at 27,02,742, of which less than 27 per cent are active cases. India’s disease burden is among the highest in the world but India’s cases per million population is among the lowest.
Maharashtra, which has the highest number of Covid cases in the country, reported 8,493 cases and 228 deaths in the last 24 hours. The case fatality rate of 3.35 per cent is the second highest in the country, below only Gujarat.
Tamil Nadu recorded 5,890 cases and 120 deaths in the last 24 hours, pushing the state’s total to 3,43,945 and the case fatality rate of 1.71 per cent, that is lower than the national average. The growth rate is 1.84 per cent.
Andhra Pradesh currently has a doubling time of 21.5 days. In the last 24 hours, the state reported 6,780 cases and 82 deaths. There are currently 8,47,777 active cases in the state.
