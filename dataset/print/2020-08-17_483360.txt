6,76,900 active cases, India’s positivity rate at 7.9%, recovery rate crosses 72%
New Delhi: After reporting over 60,000 cases each day for the past few days, India showed a marginal dip, but Uttar Pradesh has now replaced Delhi in the list of top five high Covid burden states.
The recovery rate currently stands at 62 per cent, but thanks to the Independence Day weekend, the daily tests over the past two days have shown a dip even though the positivity rate has started to come down.
In the last 24 hours, the number of cases dipped a little compared to the last few days. Over the weekend, for example, over 1,25,000 new cases had been reported. The total active cases now stand at 6,76,900.
There have been 941 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the total toll to 50,921. On each of the last three days, over 900 people have succumbed to Covid. The case fatality rate though is among the lowest in the world.
While there is very little difference in the relative positions of states on case fatality rates, the graphs for all show contractions as the case load rises on a daily basis. West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat have death rates higher than the national average.
Less than 8 lakh tests were done both on Saturday and Sunday in the country. The eventual testing target is 10 lakh per day. India has so far conducted 3,00,41,400 tests. The cumulative positivity rate is 7.9 per cent.
Since Independence Day fell on a Saturday this year, the weekend testing dip happened both days, but the good news is that the positivity rate also dipped. It was at 7.9 per cent Sunday. India’s target positivity rate is 5 per cent.
In the last 24 hours, 57,584 Covid patients recovered and were discharged from hospitals. India’s recovery rate has now crossed 72 per cent. The total recoveries stand at 19,19,842.
The total Covid cases in the country currently stand at 26,47,663. Of these, only about 25 per cent are active cases that form the base over which the pandemic will grow.
Maharashtra recorded 11,111 new cases and 288 deaths in the last 24 hours. The total number of cases now currently stands at 4,17,123, including 20,037 deaths. The doubling time is about 35 days.
Karnataka, with a growth rate of 3.53 per cent and a doubling time of 20.5 days, has a total disease burden of 2,26,966, including 3,963 deaths. The recovery rate is 62.34 per cent.
Tamil Nadu, in the last 24 hours, reported 5,950 cases and 125 deaths. The current growth rate is 1.87 per cent and the doubling time is 38.5 days.
Andhra Pradesh has a total of 2,89,829 cases now, with 8,012 active cases and 88 deaths being reported in the last 24 hours. The doubling time is over 20 days and the case fatality rate continues to be below one.
Uttar Pradesh has replaced Delhi among the top five high Covid burden states thanks to the national capital’s falling numbers and its own testing push. In the last 24 hours, it reported 4,357 cases and 56 deaths.
