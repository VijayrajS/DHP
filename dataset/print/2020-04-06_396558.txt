How Bhilwara is dealing with its coronavirus problem — Full details of the district’s plan
New Delhi: As the death toll for Covid-19 crosses 100 in India with the last week seeing a spike in cases, Union Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba said other states could consider adopting the ‘Bhilwara model’ to curb the spread of coronavirus.
The textile town in Rajasthan became a Covid-19 hotspot, registering 27 positive cases and two deaths. However in the past week, due to the strategy adopted by both the Rajasthan government and district administration, Bhilwara has not registered a single new case in a week. The 13 people who did test positive have also recovered.
