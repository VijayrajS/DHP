New Delhi: Bollywood’s latest initiative in the fight against coronavirus is a music video featuring several big names like Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, Vicky Kaushal, Kriti Sanon, and Bhumi Pednekar, among others.

The track, created by Jjust Music and Cape of Good Films, opens with a clip of PM Modi’s first televised address to the nation on Covid-19, assuring people of emerging victorious from these trying times.
It was released Monday and has already racked up over 9 lakh views on YouTube. The song is meant to be a “melody of hope” amid the ongoing crisis.
“With the ongoing situation, the citizens of almost every country are forced into isolation. Jjust Music and Cape of Good Films recognises this effort of unity and togetherness, and we would like to appreciate our nation for staying put,” explained the song’s producers.
The video features the Bollywood actors singing along to the track in their respective balconies and terraces as they practice social distancing.

The three minute and 25 second-long song features visuals of hospital beds, doctors, nurses and Mumbai Police officers on-duty. It shows the empty streets and some isolated iconic spots of the country such as Delhi’s India Gate and Jaipur’s Hawa Mahal.
The lyrics of the song are by Kaushal Kishore, with vocals and composition by Vishal Mishra. It includes verses like “Jo saath dede saara India, fir muskurayega India, fir jeet jayega India” (If all of India gives support, then we will smile, then India will win).
Akshay Kumar took to Twitter to share the video and said: “All we need is a united stand”. Similarly, Ayushmann Khurrana said the song was an “effort to spread some love and hope”.
