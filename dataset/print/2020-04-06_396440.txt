But Congress‚Äô Sivaganga MP Karti Chidambram vehemently opposed the move.
If the government wants to garner funds there are many ways, but to do away with MPLAD is absolutely unacceptable. It‚Äôs a sinister move to make constituency MPs redundant and enforce a Presidential form of government by stealth.
