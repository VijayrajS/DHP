Doubts over the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus package, extension of the nationwide lockdown and spike in COVID-19 cases in the country weighed on investor sentiment, traders said.
The government, in its first four tranches of the stimulus package, focussed on credit line to small businesses and new fund creations to be shouldered by banks and financial institutions with very little extra budget spending.
In the last set of measures, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday announced plans to privatise PSUs in non-strategic sectors and suspend loan default-triggered bankruptcy filings for one year, and also gave a Rs 40,000-crore hike in allocation for the rural employment guarantee scheme to provide jobs to migrant workers.
Further, the government last night extended the lockdown for two more weeks with the fourth phase providing more relaxations outside the containment zones.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in India spiked to 96,169, while the death toll rose to 3,029, according to the health ministry.
Globally, the number of cases linked to the disease has crossed 47.13 lakh and the death toll has topped 3.15 lakh.
Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul were trading on a positive note.
International oil benchmark Brent crude futures were trading 2.77 per cent higher at USD 33.40 per barrel.
