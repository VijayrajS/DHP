Don’t look down on TikTok. The ‘timepass’ app now has COVID-19 experts and Bollywood celebs
A friend of mine who was critical of the video-sharing app TikTok has now become an avid user of it. Driven by curiosity, he is now one of the 200 million TikTok users in India, who use the app not only for fun but also for awareness.
TikTok is no longer an app to look down on — it has health experts advising on coronavirus, actors showing bits of their life and educational videos for teenagers.
TikTok in India has been able to blur the lines between classes, rural and urban and even sexuality. The popularity of the app has increased worldwide, thanks to its inclusive nature.
Teenagers in the United States are using it for campaigning and running fact-checks for US presidential elections with some even calling it cable news for young people. Despite moderation by TikTok and attempts to ban pro-LGBTQ content, the app has become a platform for the people of the community to engage with each other.

There was a time when Tik Tok wasn’t considered a serious platform by Indian celebrities. It was almost beneath them. Now, the app has gained much recognition with Bollywood celebrities jumping on the bandwagon. From Madhuri Dixit, Deepika Padukone to Shahid Kapoor — the celebs use this as a serious medium to promote their work and stay connected with fans.
This is also different from being on Instagram as the Chinese-owned TikTok brings out the ‘fun side’ of people. How often do we see business tycoons like Raj Kundra shaking a leg with wife Shilpa Shetty and his son? Not just Bollywood, many Hollywood celebrities including Will Smith, Reese Witherspoon, Jonas brothers are among the long list of celebrities who are bringing out their fun side as TikTokers. Recently, US Senator Elizabeth Warren did a viral challenge and was seen grooving to some music while switching places with comedian Kate McKinnon, who plays her on SNL.

TikTok is no longer just a lip-sync app where users make videos for entertainment. It has become a hub of knowledge, in videos as short as 60 seconds. From fitness enthusiasts, photographers to language coaches — you name it and TikTok has it. The popular perception about the app has been that it is meant for unemployed youth who have enough time to while away on TikTok. But lately, professionals from every field are registering their presence on the platform. There are doctors and health professionals who are educating teenagers about vaping and birth control, fashion stylists giving clothing advice and photographers sharing their tricks.

Recently, the app has also created a database for addressing concerns related to the novel coronavirus. It has FAQs and curated videos to explain more about the pandemic that has affected the world.
It is also interesting to note that no matter where you live or what you do, the app provides equal access to information. The app is also democratic in nature as generating content and going viral is easier than other social media applications. Even if you’re a new user or an inexperienced video maker with a low-quality phone camera, the world of TikTok embraces you.
