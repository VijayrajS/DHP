Pakistani bureaucrat sings Shah Rukh Khan song with new lyrics to raise COVID-19 awareness
New Delhi: A Pakistani bureaucrat has tweaked a famous Bollywood song to raise awareness about coronavirus — and the video has taken Twitter by storm.
In the video, Deputy Commissioner of Hafizabad, Naveed Shahzad, made up his own lyrics of the famous Bollywood song ‘Suno Na Suno Na (Please listen)’ from Hindi cinema megastar Shah Rukh Khan’s 2003 film Chalte Chalte.
Shahzad sings, “Daro na daro na, daro na, corona se milke sab lado na, bar bar hanton ko dhona (Don’t be scared, let’s come together and fight corona, keep washing your hands).”
