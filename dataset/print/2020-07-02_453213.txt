The positivity rate stood at 8.3% as of Thursday. This is comparable to what it was a month ago, courtesy increased testing, but the average is clearly going up.

During the last 24 hours, a total of 11,881 Covid-19 patients have recovered, taking the cumulative figure to 3,59,859. This further takes the recovery rate up to 59.52%.

India crossed the 6-lakh mark in total cases, even as experts have begun to say that merely counting numbers will no longer be a reliable estimate of the course of the epidemic.
Delhi: The national capital reported 61 deaths and 2,442 fresh cases in the last 24 hours. While the slight fall in numbers has raised hopes of a “peak” having been crossed, experts say it may be too early to rejoice.

Gujarat: The state continues to top the mortality rate in the country. In the last 24 hours, 21 deaths were reported, besides 675 fresh cases.

Maharashtra: Numbers continue to look bleak in this high-burden state, with 5,537 new cases and 69 deaths having been reported in the last 24 hours.

Tamil Nadu: The state reported 3,882 cases and 63 deaths in the last 24 hours. The mortality rate currently stands at 1.3%.


Both the testing and fresh cases remain low for Gujarat among the four high-burden states. Delhi’s testing numbers look impressive but it did more antigen than RT-PCR tests in the last 24 hours.
