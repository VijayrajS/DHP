582 deaths, 63.24% recoveries, Gujarat mortality rate highest at 4.74% — India’s Covid data
New Delhi: Even as the daily deaths touched a new high at 582, the top ten states in terms of case fatality rates remained constant with a few slots up and down. Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh occupy the top three spots.
While Delhi slipped a rank at number three in terms of deaths, it curiously continues to do almost thrice as many antigen as RT-PCR tests without giving a breakup of how many antigen negatives were retested and how many came positive. According to ICMR norms, symptomatic negatives in antigen tests have to be tested again using RT-PCR.

This graph may be the most important one in the coming days as the numbers continue to rise. It will really boil down to health system preparedness in preventing deaths. Except that one spike of 2,003, it has been a very steady rise overall.
This is an important graph as it shows where state governments have faltered in preventing deaths. For example, Punjab that otherwise has not done too badly has a 2.5% mortality rate, more than a state like Tamil Nadu where the case load is far higher.

In the last 24 hours, as many as 29,429 fresh cases were reported. But there were also nearly 20,000 recoveries. The total active cases now stand at 3,19,840.

Having stayed between 2.5 lakh and 2.8 lakh for several days now, the daily testing number has breached the 3-lakh mark. The total test count now stands at 1,24,12,664.

The spike in testing numbers has ensured that there is a dip in positivity despite the close to 30,000 fresh cases. This is the lowest in a week.

The last 24 hours have seen a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 patients recovering. As many as 20,572 people were cured, taking the total number of recovered cases among Covid-19 patients to 5,92,031. The recovery rate climbed up to 63.24% Wednesday.
The total cases now stand at 9,36,181. India is now poised to breach the psychological barrier of a million cases in the next two days.

Maharashtra: Its 6,741 fresh cases have been powered by continued high numbers from Mumbai and Pune municipal areas — 954 and 1,139, respectively. It also has the second highest mortality rate.

Tamil Nadu: The state has a case fatality rate of 1.42% despite the fact that it along with Maharashtra accounts for 50 per cent of all cases in India. This state has seen 2,099 deaths so far.

Delhi: As many as 1,647 positive cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Delhi conducted 6,564 tests RT-PCR CbNAAT and TrueNAT, and 15,964 antigen tests. The breakup of the positivity rates of the two kinds of tests is not available.

Karnataka: This southern state, which at one point was doing so well, has now replaced Gujarat on the list of states with highest caseload. With 44,077 cases and 842 deaths, the state’s mortality rate stands at 1.91%. Gujarat, however, continues to top the mortality rate charts.
Delhi managed to pull up its testing numbers after a dip the previous day. Tamil Nadu is still the leader.
