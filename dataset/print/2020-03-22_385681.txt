Twitter antakshari, composing songs — how ministers & celebs are observing janata curfew
New Delhi: The ‘janata curfew’ being observed between 7am and 9pm Sunday to prevent the spread of the coronavirus has received wide acceptance from the public, judging by the photos and videos of deserted streets that have flooded social media.
Ministers and celebrities are also spending the day at their homes, and are thinking up innovative ways to pass the time — from composing songs to playing games.
Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Smriti Irani, began a game of ‘Twitter antakshari’ with her followers, urging them to tweet a line of a song to get the game going. She started with the song ‘Zindagi milke bitayenge’ from the 1982 movie Satte Pe Satta.
