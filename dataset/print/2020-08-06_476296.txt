Andaman & Nicobar Islands have highest Rt value, UP increases testing but still among lowest
New Delhi: The Covid-19 tally in India rose to 19,64,536 Thursday after over 56,000 fresh cases were reported within a span of 24 hours. The death toll also increased from 39,795 to 40,699, according to the latest data released by the Ministry of Health Affairs.
For a week now, India has reported a daily increase of over 50,000 in coronavirus cases, pushing the country’s tally to over 19 lakh cases. At 51,700, the number of recoveries was also the highest-ever for a single day on Wednesday.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
