Goa has highest daily tests at 1.17 lakh per million, Gujarat positivity rate dips to 1.34%
New Delhi: With 7,25,991 active cases of Covid-19, India has reported a total of 33,10,234 cases as of Thursday. According to the data given by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 60,472 people have died and 25,23,771 have recovered.
In ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
