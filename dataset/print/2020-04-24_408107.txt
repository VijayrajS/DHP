CNN anchor Chris Cuomo’s wife says she bathed in bleach to combat Covid-19, sparks row
New Delhi: CNN anchor Chris Cuomo’s wife Cristina has sparked a row on social media after revealing that she adds bleach to her bathwater to kill Covid-19. Both Cristina and Chris had contracted the virus in the past month but have now recovered from it.
In a post on her wellness website Purist, Cuomo wrote, “I added a small amount – ½ cup only – of Clorox to a full bath of warm water to combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it.”
She also revealed that she used a body-charger, which “sent electrical frequencies” through her body to oxygenate her blood and “stimulate the healthy production of blood cells” to strengthen her immune system.
However, bleach is a very corrosive substance and is not safe to be used on skin.
The website of Clorox, the bleach that Cuomo uses, categorically states that it is not safe to apply on skin and that it should not be added to bath water.
“Consumers should always avoid direct skin and eye contacts with both undiluted bleach, as well as prolonged contact with the various bleach solutions..using a bleach and water solution for bathing is not approved by the EPA and should not be done”, it says.
In 2019, the US Good and Drug Administration (FDA) had also said it was “not aware of any research showing that these products are safe or effective for treating any illness”.

Meanwhile, on Twitter, several users made fun of Cuomo’s strange practices, including author and gynaecologist Dr Jennifer Guntner.
I still don’t understand how this isn’t parody. I just can’t even. https://t.co/5p8fYzI5dw

I can’t decide which is more absurd,  “The Body Charger that transfers energy, breaks up, and pulls out the low frequency while replacing with a higher rate” or the “PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field) machine, which optimizes the ability of cells to start healing.” #privilege

Cuomo is not the only one to recommend the use of bleach against Covid-19. US President Donald Trump went a step further and in a press briefing Thursday said that bleach and other disinfectants could be injected into an infected person to kill the virus.
Medical experts denounced Trump’s ‘dangerous’ suggestion and urged people not to follow it. Robert Reich, a professor at University of California Berkeley, warned against Trump’s statement and said that his briefings were “actively endangering the public’s health”.

Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don't drink disinfectant. https://t.co/gRRn3sQ04T

In India, there was an uproar in March, when a group of migrant workers in Bareilly was sprayed with bleach. The UP government was heavily criticised for the same and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath later said that it was “rude and indecent” and had ordered an inquiry.
