Covid or China ⁠— which is the bigger threat? People in Leh struggle due to both
Leh: The district of Leh recorded its first coronavirus case on 7 March after two pilgrims from Iran tested positive. After that, local administration mobilised its tracking and testing measures to contain the pandemic.
However, after more stranded passengers started reaching Leh, the district saw a surge in positive cases. As of 22 June, there were 847 reported cases in the Union Territory of Ladakh, of which 557 are in Kargil and 153 in Leh. Due to rising numbers, the Leh district administration swung into action and announced both a lockdown and a rotation system for shops to keep their limited business going.
