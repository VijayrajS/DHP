What will schools do after 14 April? HRD minister to speak to states and decide
New Delhi: The central government, in consultation with state governments, is expected to take a call on how schools should proceed after 14 April, ThePrint has learnt.
Senior officials in the ministry told ThePrint that of Union Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank will have a video conference with the education ministers of different states to discuss the next course of action. This would include a discussion on whether the academic session should continue online or if schools should advance the summer break.
The 21-day nationwide lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus, imposed on 25 March, ends on 14 April. However, speculation is rife that the lockdown period could be extended as India has seen the number of cases jump to more than 6,000 this week.
Schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) have already started the new academic session through online classes, but state governments, apart from Delhi, have not yet finalised a definitive plan. The Delhi government started online learning for its schools this week.
“The minister will address the state education ministers of various states after April 14, on how to run the academic session in schools. Situation with respect to Covid-19-related restrictions will be clear only post April 14, which is when the government can take a call on the new academic session,” said a senior officer associated with the HRD minister.

The ministry Thursday also made school syllabus available on DTH networks like Tata Sky and Airtel TV through their channel SWAYAM Prabha, and have urged students to continue their studies.
These channels will have both recorded lessons and live lessons for students. During the live lessons, students will be allowed to ask questions on a helpline number provided on the screen. The helpline will be operated by the National Institute of Open Schooling. A circular regarding this has been sent to all the state governments and various boards.
The ministry has also launched a campaign called ‘Bharat padhe online’ on social media to invite suggestions from the public on how to strengthen online learning. People can send in their suggestions through email and/or social media. HRD Minister Nishank also made a public appeal inviting suggestions.
