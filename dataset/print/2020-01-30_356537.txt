However, unlike SARS, the nCoV is said to be transmissible even during the incubation period that is anywhere between two and 10 days.

The infection has been reported in at least 16 countries, including Nepal and Sri Lanka. In India, over 35,000 people have undergone thermal screening, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a statement, earlier this week.
State governments have been instructed to work in accordance with the protocol set out by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and the technical advice provided by World Health Organisation (WHO).
The government has also been planning to evacuate more than 250 Indian nationals from Wuhan, which has been under lockdown since last week.
