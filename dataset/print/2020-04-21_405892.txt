Journalist Gulshan Ewing, former editor of Eve’s Weekly, dies of Covid-19 in UK at 92
New Delhi: Veteran Indian-origin journalist Gulshan Ewing died of Covid-19 in London Saturday. She was 92. 
Over a 30-year career in the industry, Ewing served as the editor of two leading magazines — fashion and film magazine Star & Style, and Eve’s Weekly, which catered to women. 
A high-profile society journalist, Ewing interviewed and rubbed shoulders with some of the biggest stars around the world, including the likes of Gregory Peck, Cary Grant and Ava Gardener, as well as royalty. 
Ewing was born to a Parsi family in 1928 in what was then Bombay. As a journalist, she enjoyed a glamorous lifestyle, and was known to be on first-name terms with India’s leading actors and politicians from the 1960s onwards.
In a Twitter tribute, yesteryear Bollywood star Poonam Dhillon credited Ewing with facilitating her entry in movies.

According to a report in Daily Mail, Ewing’s daughter Anjali, a journalist based in London, said three interviews stood out for her mother — Gregory Peck, Cary Grant, and Danny Kaye, whom she found very charming. “She loved imitating Cary Grant’s accent,” Anjali told the British tabloid.

The coronavirus pandemic has killed over 16,000 people in the UK, and over 1.7 lakh worldwide. Care England, a representative body for such homes in England and Scotland, claims that around 7,500 residents have died from the novel coronavirus. 
Anjali alleged a delay in Ewing’s testing for Covid-19 despite the fact that she showed symptoms, adding she didn’t receive the kind of care she should have in hospital.

Ewing had no preexisting health conditions. She began to develop symptoms more than a week before her death, but it wasn’t until last Wednesday that her sample was collected. It was only delivered to the laboratory two days later, the Daily Mail reported. Coronavirus was confirmed as her cause of death a day after she had died.
