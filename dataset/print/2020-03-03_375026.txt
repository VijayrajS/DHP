Hindu Mahasabha plans gaumutra party with cow-dung cakes to fight coronavirus in India
New Delhi: To ensure the coronavirus doesn’t spread in Delhi, the Hindu Mahasabha has decided to organise a ‘gaumutra party’ on the lines of tea parties, according to its president, Chakrapani Maharaj.
The sixth case of coronavirus was confirmed in India Tuesday, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he held an extensive review on the country’s preparedness.
“Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Different ministries and states are working together, from screening people arriving in India to providing prompt medical attention,” he said in a tweet.
On the same day, Maharaj told ThePrint that there is a need to create greater awareness among the people on how gaumutra (cow urine), gobar (cow-dung) and consuming cow products can help eliminate the coronavirus.
“Just like we organise tea parties, we have decided to organise a gaumutra party, wherein we will inform people about what is coronavirus and how, by consuming cow-related products, people can be saved from it,” Maharaj, who heads one of the two factions of the Mahasabha, said.
“The event will have counters that will provide gaumutra for people to consume. At the same time, we will also put cow products like cow-dung cakes and agarbatti made from that. Upon using these, the virus will die immediately.”
The event will be first organised at Hindu Mahasabha Bhawan in Delhi, following which such ‘parties’ will be held across the country. “We are in touch with gaushalas (cow shelters) across the country, who can collaborate and work with us in our mission to eliminate corona,” he added.

Maharaj added that a big event will be organised in Delhi soon after Holi to raise awareness about the cause of coronavirus, which he claimed was the killing of animals.
“We want to create awareness about jeev hatya (killing of beings), which is the main cause of coronavirus. I know people will not believe me, but it would not have spread in India as we are mostly vegetarians,” he said.
Maharaj said after Telangana ministers organised a “publicity stunt” of consuming non-vegetarian food publicly, “the virus came to India after listening to the animals cry for help”, he claimed.
“Corona Bharat mein yagya anushthan ke kaaran shaant tha. Lekin Telangana ke in naadaan, ahankari mantriyon ne jeev hatya kar jis prakaar se sarvajanik chicken kha kar corona ko lalkaara hai, isse Bharat mein bhi ab corona ke vikraal roop dekhne ki aanshanka ban gayi hai. Atah, in mantriyo ko samay rehte corona se tatkal maafi maang leni chahiye, anyatha anarth hoga, jise koi nahin rok sakta,” he said.
Translation: Corona was quiet in India due to traditional practices like yagyas. But Telangana’s ignorant, egotistical ministers killed animals to consume chicken publicly and challenged ‘corona’, because of which the worst form of ‘corona’ is now looming over India. That’s why these ministers should, in the nick of time, apologise to ‘corona’, otherwise there will be a catastrophe that no one can stop.
Maharaj added that there was “no need to panic”, and if people start consuming gaumutra and turn vegetarian, the virus would be contained.
He had a word of advice for vegetarians too. “Vegetarians need not worry; it will not impact them. But still, as a precautionary measure, they can also start consuming gaumutra.”

I think they will send cows to fight with China and Pak in war. Bloody toilets lacking nation. So pitiable
I despair for the future of the human race when in 2020 we have people who are so blinded by their religion, so indoctrinated, to the point  where all possible ability to think critically, rationally, has been eradicated, that they believe some magic, or eating the excrement of cows, will prevent, treat or cure them of a viral illness.
This guy is fraud, he claims to be a president of Hindu Mahasabha, but he has never been member of Hindu Mahasabha in his entire life and no one knows him. Political propaganda he has created to defame hindu sadhus and mahasabha.
He should first persuade Modiji to drink gomutra and eat the cake in public so that I ca persuade myself to do the same.
Kya bawaseer phaila rahe ho Maharaj? 😂
Great solution to the virus. The maharaja should b d first to taste n start d party. Nobel committee shld award the next prize in medecine to him. They r going nuts, n u no who.##
Nobel commitee will initiate a Nobel prize for best STUPIDITY
this guy will be the first to receive
Maybe it works. Who really knows ?
…. and here we have idiots believing in anything and everything theprint peddles.
Shame on you all.
Send him to Wuhan with his followers maybe he can eradicate the corona virus where originated.
Height of stupidity.
Rumours are that Chinese declined the “swami” permission to hold gow-mutra party in china. They say you are more insane than the virus…
You have to be a hindu to be this stupid. Every community has idiots but it is only us who make them our leaders – at all levels, right up-to the national level.
God, is this the country of Gandhi, Patel and Ambedkar? Hey Ram.
WOW…Nobel Prize awaited.
By the way can he test his product in Wuhan….to withstand his claims! Instead of wasting so many words of wisdom. Strange are the followers of such thoughts.Well though I accept people hv freedom to believe .
Sayy whaattttt
How stupid can these Hindus get? Seriously this is like taking our entire culture demafing it and shaming it and sounding like the biggest uneducated nincompoops ever. SHAME ON YOU for destroying name for your idiot ideas.
I am a Staunch Hindu RSS activist and doctor as a profession but I strongly oppose and reject it as there is no scientific evidence to prove any anti viral or anti bacterial property or any other useful property in the cow Urine… Urine is just the waste product of the body and cow Urine is same as like other ruminant animals like Buffalo, goat or sheep…Nothing special in the Cow Urine or cow milk or cow dung…Why such idiots are allowed to spread such a misinformation…
Sir staunch hindu and RSS don’t fit in the same line because when the Azad Hind Fauj was fighting for our countrie’s freedom and Bose required assistance from Savarkar he carried out a RSS rally on the streets giving a salaam to the queen of England, so you should check your facts.
only a retard would believe twisted words with no source and credibility. in which the desperation to malign a community seems evident.
If you wish to see one, look into a mirror.
Have You fact checked it? Wether he actually said it or not?
Please tell me it is a satirical post.
Feeling sorry for this country
