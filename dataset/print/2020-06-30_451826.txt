Over 2 lakh tests again after Sunday dip, 18,522 new cases, 418 deaths: Latest Covid data
New Delhi: India’s coronavirus case tally now stands at 5,66,840, two days after crossing the 5-lakh mark. Over the last 24 hours, as many as 18,522 new infections and 418 deaths have been reported across the country. The recovery rate is now over 59%, with the number of cured patients exceeding active cases.

India reported 18,522 fresh Covid cases in the last 24 hours, taking the total active cases tally to 2,15,125. It has been some time now that active cases are less than recovered cases, but the worm keeps climbing a steep slope.

After a sharp fall on Sunday, testing recovered again Monday with 2,10,292 samples being tested in the 24 hours till 9 am Tuesday morning. However, it is still lower than some of the highs that were hit in the last few days, the highest being 2,31,095 on June 27.
The number of deaths in the last 24 hours crossed the 400 mark to touch 418. However, this is not the highest single-day toll as clearing of earlier backlogs in some states had pushed the daily toll beyond 2,000 earlier this month.

There are now 1,19,696 more recovered patients than active cases in all. So far, 3,34,821 patients have been cured or discharged. The recovery rate is 59.07%.

After a sudden spike on Monday because of low testing over the weekend, the positivity rate has returned to usual levels. But the worm in this graph is certainly headed upwards, and that is not a good sign.

The total numbers went past the 5.5 lakh mark with over 18,522 cases being reported in the last 24 hours. However, the graph has now started moving slower than the projections the Centre had shared with states in April.
Delhi: The national capital continues to remain a hotspot, though the number of daily cases has come down marginally to 85,161. The toll now stands at 2,680 with 57 deaths having been reported in the last 24 hours.

Gujarat: The state is still among the top four in India in terms of total cases, though the number of active cases is only 6,871 at present. The mortality rate is 5.7%.

Maharashtra: The numbers keep going up for Maharashtra, with 5,257 cases having been reported in the last 24 hours. As many as 181 Covid deaths were reported on Tuesday. Of these, 78 deaths occurred in the last 48 hours, while the rest were added to the toll after they were identified as Covid cases. Case fatality rate in the state is 4.48%.

Tamil Nadu: The state has had 86,224 total cases so far, with 3,949 cases having been detected in the last 24 hours, during which Tamil Nadu also reported 62 deaths. The state, however, has a low mortality rate compared to the other high-burden states, and it is also testing the most.


Delhi and Maharashtra seem to be testing comparable numbers every day, even though about 40 per cent tests in Delhi are antigen tests. Gujarat clearly is testing the least among the high burden states.
