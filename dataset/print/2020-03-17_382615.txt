Ranjan Gogoi sanitiser, Kerala robot dispenser & empty New York — Twitter reels under COVID-19
New Delhi: Jokes, jibes and jarring visuals were some highlights from Twitter today as coronavirus brought the busiest cities to a halt. In India, however, it’s politics as usual for many parties. 
For starters, historian Ramachandra Guha hits below the belt to land a blow on ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi for his appointment to the Rajya Sabha.
In 2012, Arun Jaitley, then leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, remarked, "There are two kinds of judges–one who knows the law, the other who knows the Law Minister".Now there are three kinds of judges; the third kind knowing the Law Minister AND the Home Minister.

 Congress member Shama Mohamed and media professional Tarique Anwer highlight the BJP’s ‘U–Turn’ on appointments of previous judges to Parliament.
–@narendramodi, who was once so vocal against awarding Rajya Sabha seats to Judges post retirement, is now sending #RanjanGogoi to the Rajya Sabha.

 Art director Smriti Kiran shares a motivating account of a coronavirus survivor.
A kind friend shared this with me. Her friend Kartikeya is recovering from #COVID2019. He is 43. He got his test done on DAY1. It is one of the most reassuring things I have read but it does not take away from the severity of the virus. Word of caution: DO NOT SELF MEDICATE. pic.twitter.com/sSlX8eXIbv

When life gives you a crisis, you turn it into a…..social media campaign, in this case, a useful one. Here’s Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan literally teaching Indian citizens how to wash their hands.
I request all citizens to take the #SafeHands challenge & POST THEIR VIDEOS HERE to help create mass awareness ! 
Washing hands thoroughly with soap & water kills #coronavirus !

In trying times humour always comes to our rescue. Comedians Akshar Pathak and Trevor Noah imagine what Italy-like balcony concerts would look like in their cities.
