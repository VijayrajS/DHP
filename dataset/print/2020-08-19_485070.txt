Telangana & Andhra Covid infection rates below 1, MP records lowest tests per million
New Delhi: With a total of 6,76,514 active cases of Covid-19 in India, the country’s infection tally has reached 27,67,273 cases Wednesday. According to the data by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 52,889 people have succumbed to the virus and 20,37,870 have been discharged.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
