Release of NEET admit cards delayed, but no decision yet on rescheduling exam
New Delhi: The National Testing Agency (NTA) has delayed releasing the admit cards for National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET), which is meant for admission to medical colleges, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The agency was supposed to release the admit cards on 27 March, which has now been delayed until 14 April, when the 21-day nationwide lockdown ends, and beyond, ThePrint has learnt.
The NTA is responsible for conducting various entrance exams such as the NEET and the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE).
There is, however, no decision yet on whether the date of the exam, scheduled to take place on 3 May, will be changed or not.
‚ÄúWe are not releasing the admit cards tomorrow (Friday). However, there is no decision yet on rescheduling the exam. We are in touch with all the agencies and will take a final call after coordinating with everyone,‚Äù an official in the NTA told ThePrint.¬†
He added the agency will issue an official circular in this regard Friday.¬†

Over 15 lakh students have registered for NEET this year, the results of which are scheduled to be announced in June. 
The Ministry of Human Resource Development had on 24 March written to all states and autonomous bodies like the NTA to work on rescheduling of exams dates.¬†
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) along with the NTA will work on a revised schedule for board exams and entrance exams. The JEE has already been postponed by the NTA.¬†
The lockdown has forced the government to look at an alternate academic calendar. 
Autonomous bodies like the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have also been asked to work on an alternate academic calendar.
