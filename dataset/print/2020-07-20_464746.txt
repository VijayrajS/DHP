Andaman and Nicobar record lowest Rt value, Maharashtra retains highest positivity rate
New Delhi: In its daily state tracker, ThePrint traces the progress of Indian states and union territories in terms of their testing capabilities. We analyse the number of tests being conducted and the rate at which the infection is spreading.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
