Andaman & Nicobar Islands retain highest positivity rate, Tripura records lowest infection rate
New Delhi: India crossed the 23-lakh mark in coronavirus cases Wednesday with 60,963 new cases, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. With this, India’s tally has reached 23,29,638 cases, of which 46,091 are deaths and 16.39 lakh are recoveries.
While daily cases had dipped to below 60,000 for the first time in four days Tuesday, it once again crossed the 60,000-mark Wednesday.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
