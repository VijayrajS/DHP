5,28,242 active cases the ‘actual burden’, 94 lakh tests this month, 11.6% positivity rate
New Delhi: From 88 lakh total tests on 1 July to 1.82 crore on 30 July — this month has been about pushing India’s testing limits, even though the positivity too has remained almost consistently high for the last two weeks.
The country reported 52,123 cases in the last 24 hours — the highest ever — and 775 deaths. However, the rising caseload every day has ensured that despite the steep daily deaths curve, India’s mortality rate is actually coming down, even though the absolute numbers look daunting.

India’s active Covid-19 caseload currently stands at 5,28,242. As the Ministry of Health emphasised in its weekly Covid briefing, this is the actual disease burden in the country, and not the “historical” figure of million and a half.
 

The Covid death trajectory is once again on an uphill path. In the last 24 hours, 775 people died of the disease, taking the total to 34,968.

The mortality chart remains constant even though the figures are coming down in almost every state. The case fatality rate currently stands at 2.21%.

The total tests conducted in the country in the last 24 hours is 4,46,642. There has been a sharp increase in the cumulative testing — from 88 lakh total tests on 1 July to nearly 1.82 crore on 30 July. The Tests Per Million (TPM) has increased to 13,181.

The positivity rate is now 11.6% nationally, even though the target is to keep it below 10, as the health ministry reiterated Thursday. However, 21 states and UTs have a positivity rate of less than 10%.

With 32,553 patients discharged in the last 24 hours, the total recoveries have jumped to 10,20,582. The recovery rate among Covid patients stands at 64.44% Thursday. The gap between recovered patients and active cases currently stands at 4,92,340. With this figure, the recovered cases are 1.9 times the 5,28,242 active cases, all under medical supervision.

The total Covid cases in India is now 15,83,792 — the figure that the government says is “historical”. About a third of these are active cases.

Maharashtra has now crossed the 4-lakh mark, with 9,211 new cases and 298 deaths in the last 24 hours. The state has a doubling time of less than 30 days.

Tamil Nadu, with a positivity rate just under 10%, reported 6,426 fresh cases in the last 24 hours. The state also saw 82 deaths, taking the toll up to 3,741.

Delhi’s current doubling time is over 93 days. The state reported 1,035 cases and 26 deaths in the last 24 hours. However, at 2.93%, it’s fatality is higher than the national average.

Andhra Pradesh reported 10,093 cases and 65 deaths in the last 24 hours. The state now has a fatality rate or 1.01% and a recovery rate of 46.02%.

Karnataka reported 5,503 cases and 92 deaths in the last 24 hours, but what may be a bigger concern is the fact that the state has a doubling time of less than 13 days.

Delhi’s caseload is now starting to look tiny compared to the others, but so is its testing bar. Andhra Pradesh has surpassed Tamil Nadu for the second day in a row as the state that’s testing the most.
