Bihar’s positivity rate sees sharp drop while Goa, the highest tester, see its number climb
New Delhi: India crossed the 18-lakh mark Monday as the health ministry reported 52,972 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 771 deaths in the last 24 hours. India, which crossed the 15-lakh mark on 29 July, has recorded over 3 lakh cases in less than a week. More than 50,000 daily cases are have been recorded for a week now.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
