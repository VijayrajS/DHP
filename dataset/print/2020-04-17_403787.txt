Indian women’s hockey team kickstart fitness challenge to raise funds for migrant families
New Delhi: The Indian women’s hockey team launched a fitness challenge Friday to raise funds for poor and migrant families whose lives have been affected by the nationwide lockdown to curb Covid-19.
The 18-day fitness challenge will see different members of the team doing fitness tasks ranging from burpees, lunges, squats to spiderman pushups, pogo hops and more.
It aims to raise money through crowdfunding — a player will set a new challenge everyday, tagging 10 people on their social media handles to take up the challenge and donate Rs 100 to the fundraiser.
Proceeds from the campaign will be donated to an NGO called Uday Foundation to provide basic necessities for patients hosted at various locations, migrant workers and slum dwellers. The funds will also be used to provide soaps and hand sanitisers along with food rations.
In a video featuring all the members of the team, the athletes urged others to join the fitness fundraiser as well and donate Rs 100 daily.
Our entire team has decided to help the needy families during these tough times of Covid-19 & help us reach the goal to feed 1000 families by donating Rs.100 to https://t.co/5lDjS52gsl #100da #TakeChallengeGive100  #Give100ForCOVID @TheHockeyIndia pic.twitter.com/TokVa5ltgi

“All of us in the Indian Women’s Hockey Team come from poor economic backgrounds and we have seen days when we have struggled for food and other basics. Today we are in a position to help and we want to ensure poor people get basics like food and sanitary kits,” said Vice Captain Savita Punia in a statement.

Echoing the sentiment, Captain Rani Rampal said, “A few days back when I was talking to my father, he said, ‘If you did not play hockey and lift us out of poverty then maybe we also would have been in the same condition as so many poor people today who are struggling to get food.’ When he said this to me, it broke my heart.”
“Everyone in the team has faced so many challenges due to poverty and we know the pain of not getting food. It’s thanks to hockey our lives are comfortable today but not everyone is this fortunate,” she added.
Rampal’s father was a cart-puller and survived on daily wages in Haryana.

Psephologist Yashwant Deshmukh called the team’s effort a ‘Chak De’ moment, referring to the popular Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 2007 movie ‘Chak De India’ on women hockey players.
