Positivity rate climbs to 8.5% with 68,898 new cases, India Covid tally to soon cross 30 lakh
New Delhi: After notching up a record high in testing Wednesday, the numbers slipped significantly Thursday, managing to just stay above 8 lakh. This has caused a spike in the positivity rate as the daily numbers are now dangerously close to 70,000 for a second day in a row.
Maharashtra’s upward trend shows no signs of calming down even as UP’s testing numbers look impressive.
In the last 24 hours, India reported 68,898 cases — the second successive day that the number has come close to 70,000. The total active cases in the country stands at 6,92,028.
The daily casualties are now close to 1,000. The lowest in the past week has been 876 on 17 August. The total toll stands at 54,849. The case fatality rate is 1.89 per cent.
While allegations of under reporting of deaths against both the Centre and states keep coming back, it is a fact that not only is the case fatality rate going down almost on a daily basis, but in 17 states and UTs, it is already below one.
This is the reason for the spike in positivity. In the last 24 hours, 8,05,985 tests were done. This is a sharp drop from yesterday’s record high of 9,18,470. It was also the only time the tests crossed 9 lakh.
The daily positivity rate has gone up again, albeit a little. This has been the highest since 15 August when the testing dipped due to the Independence Day holiday. The target is to bring positivity down to 5 per cent.
In the last 24 hours, 62,282 have recovered, taking the total recoveries to over 21.5 lakh (21,58,946). The gap between recovered patients and active cases has also increased — 14,66,918.
Over the coming weekend, India will hit the 30-lakh mark in total cases. Of these, just 22.82 per cent cases are active. India’s recovery rate currently stands at 74.28 per cent.
Maharashtra can easily be termed the Covid capital of the country. In the last 24 hours, the state recorded 14,647 cases and 326 deaths. The current growth rate stands at 2 per cent.
Uttar Pradesh currently has 1,72,334 cases, of which 4,824 cases and 95 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The doubling time is about 24.5 days and the case fatality rate is 1.59 per cent.
Karnataka, with 2,56,975 cases, is the state with the fourth highest disease burden in the country. However, the doubling time of 21.1 days is lower than the national average of almost 30 days. The good news is that the case fatality rate is lower too.
Tamil Nadu saw 5,986 cases and 116 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking its total to 3,61,435. The doubling time is 41 days and the growth rate is 1.74 per cent.
