‘Hands, washing hands…’ — Neil Diamond’s coronavirus parody of 1969 hit is winning hearts
New Delhi: With most of the world quarantined and practising social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic that has affected more than 190 countries across the world, singer Neil Diamond took to Twitter Sunday to send a message to people and cheer them up.
In a video, starring his pet dog, the American singer-songwriter and actor, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, said though times were tough with people practising social distancing and being quarantined, if everyone sang together, they might feel better.

Diamond then began strumming his guitar and improvised the lyrics of his popular song Sweet Caroline (1969), by singing “Hands, washing hands. Reaching out. Don’t touch me and I won’t touch you.”
The original lyrics of the song are: “Hands, touching hands. Reaching out, touching me, touching you.”
Posted Sunday, the video has got nearly 5 million views on the microblogging site. While many thanked Diamond for the message, some even suggested an entire rewrite of the song, titled Sweet Quarantine.
Thank you Mr. Diamond. During this time, we can’t be physically touching hands, but we can “reaching out” to one another virtually. 
The silver lining in this temporary national and global challenge, is it will remind us we are radically dependent on one another.
