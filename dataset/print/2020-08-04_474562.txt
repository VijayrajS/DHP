Puducherry sees spike in positivity rate, displaces Maharashtra from long-held top spot
New Delhi: New coronavirus infections Tuesday jumped by 52,050 in India, taking the nationwide tally to 18,55,746. This is the sixth consecutive day that Covid-19 cases have increased by more than half-a-lakh in the country.
According to the health ministry’s update, there are 5,86,298 active cases and 38,938 fatalities, of which 803 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. So far, 12,30,510 patients have been cured or discharged.
The number of tests too have gone up in the country. On Monday, India recorded the highest single-day testing by conducting over 6.6 lakh tests to diagnose Covid-19.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
