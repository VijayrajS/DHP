The doubling time is now 20 days. This, even as daily deaths have now settled at over 700. However, a massive increase in testing to over 5 lakh Sunday has finally managed to push the crucial positivity rate below the critical mark of 10%. India is now aiming to test a million samples a day.

Over the weekend, India added close to 1 lakh cases. On Monday, 49,931 fresh cases were reported, taking the total number of active cases to 4,85,114.

The total now stands at 32,771. The case fatality rate is progressively falling and currently it is 2.28%.
