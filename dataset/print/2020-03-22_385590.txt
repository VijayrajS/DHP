New Delhi: A batch of 263 Indians evacuated from Italy in view of the COVID-19 outbreak there were brought back to the country on Sunday and sent to a ITBP quarantine facility, officials said.
“The special flight had 263 passengers. It landed at around 10 am at Delhi airport from Rome,” an Air India official said.
The Air India flight had taken off from the Delhi airport on Saturday.
