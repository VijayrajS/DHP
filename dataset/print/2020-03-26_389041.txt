Punjab CM seeks help from Centre to clear pending wage liabilities of MGNREGA workers
Chandigarh: Amid the coronavirus lockdown, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has sought financial assistance from the Central government to clear all pending liabilities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme.
In a letter to Union Minister of Rural Development and Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar, Captain Amarinder Singh raised the issue of pending wage liabilities of MGNREGA workers in Punjab and said that they will not be able to sustain their families during the pan-India lockdown without their daily wages and lack of fresh employment opportunities. “Captain Amarinder Singh apprised the Union Minister that as on March 24, 2020, wage liabilities of Rs 84 crore were pending for approximately 1.30 lakh workers in the state,” an official statement said on Thursday.
Singh said that the release of funds would also help the state handle the present difficult situation to some extent.
