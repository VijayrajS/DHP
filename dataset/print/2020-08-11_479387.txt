Chandigarh records highest Rt value at 1.37, Andhra Pradesh’s positivity rate increases
New Delhi: India reported a dip in daily coronavirus cases for the first time in four days with 53,601 new cases Tuesday. With this, India’s Covid tally reached 22,68,675 cases, of which 45,257 were deaths and 15.8 lakh recoveries, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
