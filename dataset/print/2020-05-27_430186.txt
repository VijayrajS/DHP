‘Others were sweeping, cooking, I made a film’: Ram Gopal Varma releases Coronavirus trailer
New Delhi: Film director Ram Gopal Varma had been busy during the lockdown. He made a full-fledged feature film. And you guessed it right — it’s on coronavirus, which is also its title. The trailer was released on YouTube Tuesday, which is trending at number 21 in India.
The director of ‘Sarkar’, ‘Rangeela’ and ‘Satya’ took to Twitter Tuesday to announce his latest venture claiming that it has been made during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown while strictly adhering to all the guidelines.
The four-minute trailer revolves around a family living together during the lockdown. Things turn murky when one of the household members starts showing symptoms of a flu. The film is made in Telugu and features actor Srikanth Iyengar.

The trailer reflects the sets of a horror movie with dark-themed lighting and eerie background score. However, Varma clarified that it is not a horror film but about “horrors which are inside all of us including our great political leaders and bureaucrats who actually know only as much as us which is just nothing”.
CORONAVIRUS is not a HORROR film. It is about the HORRORS which are inside all of us including our great political leaders and beaurecrauts who actually know only as much as us which is just nothing .”THE ONLY THING I KNOW IS THAT I KNOW NOTHING”-Socrates https://t.co/fun1Ed36Sn

Film exhibitor Akshaye Rathi said only Varma has the ‘keeda’ to pull off something like this.
There’s only one man on planet Earth who has the ‘keeda’ to pull off something like this. A film called #Corona, which has been shot during the lockdown period which has been imposed because of the #Coronavirus. ⁦@RGVzoomin⁩  https://t.co/k963VknjuV
