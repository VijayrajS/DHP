Apart from this, the board has also urged parents to educate their children about the precautions required to avoid Covid-19. The exam admit card will also contain these instructions.
As reported by ThePrint, the instruction are in line with the CBSE‚Äôs strategy to complete conducting the exams during the pandemic.
The board will also ensure that only 12 students are seated in a room meant for 24 so that basic physical distancing is maintained. There, however, will be no thermal screening or temperature screening at the exam halls. Instead, the board has asked parents to inform the school in advance if their child is ill.
