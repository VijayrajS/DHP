In pictures: India observes ‘janata curfew’ with claps, empty roads and closed shops
New Delhi: India is observing a 14-hour ‘janata curfew’ from 7am to 9pm Sunday to check the spread of COVID-19. The ‘curfew’ was called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Thursday address to the nation.
In response to the call, streets across national capital Delhi wore a deserted look Sunday, with most forms of public transport closed. Marketplaces, restaurants, gym, bars and liquor shops were already closed in the preceding days as a precaution, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
The silence of was broken just before 5pm, as people responded to Modi’s call to appreciate those engaged in essential services by coming out on to their balconies, clapping hands, clanging utensils, blowing conch shells and even bursting firecrackers.
