Shahid Kapoor, your muscles can wait. Let coronavirus pass before you hit the gym
The coronavirus pandemic may have been successful in keeping a large number of people indoors, but there is one lot in India that refuses to bow down — the B-town celebs. Bollywood stars are living it up even during the times of coronavirus. While Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira Kapoor hit the gym, Shah Rukh Khan decided to meet his friend Karan Johar for a party at the latter’s place.
Sara Ali Khan went to Varanasi for Ganga Aarti and Tara Sutaria was spotted walking the ramp at a fashion show. The rest of them are just washing hands, and that gives us a peek into their plush bathrooms.
With the power to influence and urge people to stay at home, Bollywood celebrities have been tweeting and putting up Instagram posts about social distancing and self-isolation. But the reality is different.

The gym that Shahid and Mira Kapoor chose for their workout had already been shut for its regular members, but was reportedly opened specially for the couple. As photos and videos of the couple became public, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) came down heavily on the gym owner and sealed the place.

 
 While the rest of Mumbai’s fitness enthusiast wonder how to survive the closure of gyms as precaution against the spread of corona virus Shahid Kapoor manages squeeze in an exclusive session at his Bandra gym in Mumbai  @shahidkapoor  Paparazzi#Fashion#bollywood#lovemyjob#photography#Mumbai#India

If there was ever an example of VIP treatment and stubbornness combined, it would be this. A large part of an actor’s job, especially in Bollywood, is to stay fit and look good, but one would also expect it to be every rational person’s responsibility to understand, and educate others, about the gravity of a pandemic.

Governments aren’t shutting down borders, issuing health advisories and closing restaurants and clubs for vogue. With markets crashing, the service industry taking a huge hit and even Kapoor’s own industry — the Producers Guild — creating a relief fund for daily wage workers, it might be helpful to explain to these actors what a shutdown is and why it is important.
Many reports suggest that the worst is yet to come. Flouting rules and keeping a gym open for yourself doesn’t really help the situation.

Many Bollywood actors are worshipped by people, but even the God, whoever he or she may be, wouldn’t try teaching grown-ups how to wash their hands.

True, the World Health Organization (WHO) has appealed people to clean hands regularly and thoroughly with “an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water”, but to make full-fledged tutorials out of it and hashtag it as #SafeHandsChallenge is simply ridiculous.
Thank You @DrTedros, for nominating me for the #SafeHands Challenge!#COVID19 surely is an uphill health and public safety task, but all of us are in this fight together!I further nominate @rogerfederer,@Cristiano and @imVkohli to take up this challenge! #coronavirus #StaySafe https://t.co/45glSxXkqP pic.twitter.com/7s7R4pIrrL

This might come as a surprise to these Bollywood actors, but we know how to wash our hands, and have been doing it the WHO way a lot before the coronavirus outbreak.

Browse through celebrity photographer Manav Manglanis’ Instagram pages and you will know that many from the Hindi movie industry are oblivious to the threat of coronavirus. But hey, the mask looks fashionable.
Maybe it’s time for a role reversal, but here’s a small tutorial for these celebrities. Coronavirus is highly contagious. While you may be a healthy person and might not die if you get the virus, you are seriously putting in danger someone older and with a medical history. With three deaths and over 160 reported cases, the coronavirus pandemic is only increasing in India. India is also among the countries with lowest testing rates, which implies that there could be a lot more positive cases.
So, rather than going out and risking others, for Bollywood producers and directors, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to stay at home and pen scripts on coronavirus: Love in the Time of Corona, Corona Pyaar Hai, Corona Corona Hota Hai, or Kal Corona Ho Na Ho.
It’s not that far-fetched an idea, considering many producers made a beeline to secure rights to make a movie on the abrogation of Article 370. Corona could be next.
