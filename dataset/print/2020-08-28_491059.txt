Swamy‚Äôs question on Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚Äòact of god‚Äô, Anurag Kashyap offers ‚Äòproof‚Äô to Times Now
New Delhi: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman‚Äôs comment that the coronavirus pandemic is an ‚Äòact of god‚Äô and may result in contraction of the economy, at the 41st GST Council meeting Thursday drew strong reactions from social media users. Actor Rhea Chakraborty‚Äôs interview to India Today also kept the twitterati extremely busy.
Haseeb Drabu, former Jammu and Kashmir finance minister had this to say on Sitharaman‚Äôs comment.
Union Finance Ministry can‚Äôt be behaving like an insurance company by invoking ‚ÄúAct of God‚Äù argument to deny compensation to states. Remember Paresh Rawal film Oh My God! There are many ways to finance the compensation fund deficit provided centre covers its commitment deficit.

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy has a question for Sitharaman about God.
I am reliably informed that FM N. Sitharaman told a meeting that COVID-19 is an act God!! I will post the video soon. Was the decline in annual growth rate in GDP from 8 % in FY 15 to (1st Qtr 2020) 3.1 % pre-C0VID, also an act of God ?

For herself, Sitharaman remained focussed on the sixth anniversary of Jan Dhan Yojana.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has brought in financial inclusion in India in an unprecedented scale. It was on this day six years ago.

Journalist Pritish Nandy lauds Rhea Chakraborty‚Äôs composure even as she finds herself in the eye of a storm.
I don‚Äôt know Rhea Chakraborty but am impressed by how she is holding up against the brute might of all those eager to blame her for Sushant‚Äôs death. It‚Äôs not easy being a woman on a crime scene. It‚Äôs worse if you were the victim‚Äôs live-in partner. You are easy prey.

Activist Gurmehar Kaur is one person who can identify with Chakraborty‚Äôs plight.
Watching Rhea in those interviews, vulnerable and trying to put on a brave face reminded me same witch hunt, vilification, twisting of lies, being reduced to Prime Time news entertainment when I was 19. My heart goes out to Rhea Chakraborty and her family. This too shall pass.

Rajya Sabha MP Dr Akhilesh P Singh and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, signatories to the G 23 letter seem to have had a change of heart..
I‚Äôve been silent for 4 days on recent events in @incIndia because once the CongressPresident says the issue is behind us, it is the duty of all of us to work together constructively in the interests of the Party. I urge all my colleagues to uphold this principle & end the debate.
‚Äî Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) August 27, 2020

Although I signed a letter to CP, it was never my intent to discuss party matters publicly. With Sonia ji charting out a clear path for #Congress in the CWC, I have full confidence in her & Rahul ji. I urge my friends to have faith & not discuss these issues in public either.
