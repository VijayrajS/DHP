Retd IAS officer and social activist Harsh Mander blames the states for the misery of migrant workers.
Unless railways run thousands of trains daily, it won't be possible for millions of stranded migrants to return. This unending humanitarian crisis could have been averted only by state payment of wages during lockdown. Instead they were profoundly failed & abandoned by the state
