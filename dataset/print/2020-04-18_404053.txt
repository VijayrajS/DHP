Uddhav Thackeray has failed to handle Covid crisis. Bring in Army to save Mumbai
A national calamity is not the time for a political attack. It is time to stand by the government. But when the sheer ineptitude and stubbornness of the government endangers the safety of people, it becomes important to seek accountability. Asking questions is a responsibility.
Uddhav Thackeray government has failed to handle the coronavirus situation in Maharashtra, so, it is important that the central government brings in the Army to handle the slums of Dharavi and Govandi in Mumbai. If proper protocols are followed, these areas might require up to 10 lakh tests — the state government looks unprepared to handle it, or its aftermath.
The Maharashtra Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP coalition government’s inability to get its act together even after a month has put the city of Mumbai at grave risk.
Is there an official war room at all in Maharashtra to manage Covid-19? Has Thackeray pulled up the home minister Anil Deshmukh in the wake of his unending failures? Is Mumbai entirely outsourced to the BMC? Is the CM being updated at all by the health minister? (By the way, both home and health ministries are with NCP). Moreover, how many of the state ministers have visited the districts that are assigned to them as guardian ministers or have they treated the lockdown as a holiday?
Considering that even 40 days after the detection of the first Covid-19 case in Mumbai, the state government is struggling to get its act together, there is a growing sentiment among the informed classes that Army deployment in the slums of Dharavi and Govandi is needed to save Mumbai.
Let me explain with hard facts.

Let us look at the latest Covid-19 figures from Mumbai as on 15 April.
With 1,936 cases distributed pretty much equally across the city, and with the slum clusters of Dharavi and Govandi emerging as the new hotspots, anyone who knows Mumbai even remotely would know the damage the city is staring at. Worli, with nearly 400 cases, by the way, is Aaditya Thackeray’s constituency.
What makes the situation intriguing is the unabated, relentless rise of new containment zones after 24 days of lockdown (Maharashtra has been lockdown since 22 March), which obviously makes a mockery of lockdown compliance.
Maharashtra and Kerala were nearly at the same level two weeks ago. Now, as Maharashtra struggles, Kerala has been able to successfully flatten the curve.
Now, let us look at the critical components – medical preparedness and lockdown effectiveness in combating the coronavirus and how they failed miserably in Maharashtra.

Maharashtra now accounts for 23.9 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases in India and 44.3 per cent of the total Covid-19 deaths. In fact, the mortality rate in Maharashtra (6.5-7 per cent) is higher than the global average (3.4 per cent).
Considering that Mumbai is equipped with better medical facilities than most other parts of India, there could only be two plausible reasons for the high mortality rate in the city. One is poor medical preparedness in hospitals to fight Covid19; the other is perhaps a much higher number of undetected cases.
Most hospitals chosen to treat Covid-19 patients were ill-prepared for it. The Covid-19 sections in the hospitals required foolproof segregation, which did not happen. Instead of getting all or most of Covid-19 patients under one roof or two, they were scattered across the city. This explains why one of the largest numbers of hospitals shut due to Covid-19 as well as a large number of infected medical professionals is in Mumbai.
In fact, a tweet by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor admonishing the Maharashtra government for “poor conditions” in isolation wards pretty much sums up the ground situation.
Despite the availability of adequate PPEs in Mumbai, the government has been unable to ensure that the PPEs reach the hospitals. Neither has it been able to provide proper security in Covid-19 hospitals. Even on 15 April, when India entered the second phase of lockdown, another unsavoury episode of mismanagement was reported from Juhu’s Cooper hospital.
Apart from the hospital challenges, as of today, three large police colonies in Mumbai stand sealed, demoralising the city’s police force.

It is important here to expose the Maharashtra government’s claims of “more testing than any other state”. As of Friday, the tests per million (TPM) people in Maharashtra is below Rajasthan and Kerala (among bigger states)and even below Delhi among the smaller states. At over 50,000 total tests in Maharashtra, the state has done approximately 17-18 per cent of total tests in India. But considering that the state accounts for 23.9 per cent of the cases in the country, this testing is low. More testing at this stage is a grave necessity, not choice.
But starting 12 April, testing protocols have been abruptly changed in Mumbai. Now, non-high-risk contacts won’t be tested. Considering that 65 per cent of Mumbai coronavirus patients have been asymptomatic, one can imagine the grave danger this alteration carries. It also goes against the guidelines of the ICMR.
Also read: Dharavi is a ticking bomb in the Covid-19 challenge, nothing being rolled out will be enough
Umpteen images and videos from across the city in the last three weeks attest that the lockdown has been shambolic.
Let us look at some more outrageous lockdown violations.
— A Thane engineer allegedly gets picked up by NCP workers on 5 April for a Facebook post. They take him to the house of NCP minster, Jitendra Awhad. There, the engineer is beaten black and blue, in the presence of Awhad’s police bodyguards. Two of the policemen, arrested for beating the man, have tested positive for Covid-19. The NCP councillor from Thane, Milind Patil has claimed that Jitendra Awhad had tested positive for Covid19, which, if true, means, that apart from unleashing violence, the minister, is also a ‘super spreader’. Has Uddhav Thackeray considered action against Awhad? Now reports claim Awhad has tested negative, while 14 people who came in contact with him have tested Covid-positive.
— The hasty and sudden permission given by principal secretary of the Maharashtra home department, Amitabh Gupta to 23 members of the Wadhawan family to travel to Mahabaleshwar during the lockdown, stands well exposed. Apart from the official having been sent on leave, no investigation followed.
— Let us not forget that a significant number of Tablighis from Maharashtra who attended the Nizamuddin markaz congregation have not been traced. Last week, Anil Deshmukh had claimed that 58 markaz attendees were incommunicado. This week he has claimed that 40 out of 58 have been traced. Considering Deshmukh’s credibility crisis, these numbers can be taken only with a pinch of salt.
— The massive migrant workers’ crowd outside Bandra station on 14 April, is mired in mystery. The fact that 3,000 people could congregate in the heart of Bandra when I have personally found it difficult to even step out to the grocers’ raises several questions. The fact that a similar congregation happened in Mumbra, the stronghold of Jitendra Awhad, and the fact that the arrested alleged instigator, Vinay Dubey, whose social media posts flaunt his proximity to NCP leaders, does not look coincidental. Equally shocking is a purported video from the site of chaos in Bandra where the migrant workers were supposedly being tutored to rebel.
The above incidents clearly show that CM Uddhav Thackeray has little or no knowledge of what his home minister or other cabinet ministers are up to.
The next few days are critical for Mumbai’s future.

Waah, ThePrint!!! You read an entire article and then you inform me that the author is a member of the BJP. How fantastic!, You should place that “note” right in the beginning of the article, so that I don’t waste my time reading bullshit!!!
This article was written on 18 April 2020. Today is 9 May 2020. We are still screwed and now the esteemed politicians and bureaucrats will blame everyone except themselves.
We must be unique, why so, because post 40+ days of lockout we are the only country and state where infections are still rising
Did we not know that dharavi was a time bomb. Did we not know that Mumbai is a super high density area and all slums are a time bomb.
We have the richest municipal org in the country and yet they have failed to provide the basics., water supply problem , water quality issue , road issue and now Corona issue. Our sheer bad luck that these chaps have been voted for 25 years and have failed us consistently. Its also our fault that we voted for them.
Now our great BMC will claim that due to corona rest of the stuff in the city could not be done.
V V disappointed with the our state (the great 3 political parties) and bmc; Summer will soon end and monsoon will start and our great State Govt and BMC will still expect us to maintain physical distancing.  AND STILL THE STATE HEALTH MINISTER WILL CLAIM THAT THE INFECTION RATE WILL FLATTEN IN NEXT 15-20 DAYS !!!
As a Mumbaikar i watch this city drown in chaos and fall in the gutter. .
(NO I AM NOT A BJP SUPPORTER; AM A SUPPORTER OF GOOD GOVERNANCE)
In mumbai most of areas are not getting food neither proper services that’s why this people coming from their houses and sitting on the street for the food
If these people get proper services and food i think so they will stay at their houses.
Also please don’t beat them  explain them in sweet tounge to keep distance and avoid to come out from their houses . Also keep cleanliness in their houses , areas ya society .
Very very true! The state govt in Maharashtra just wants revenue to be generated at the cost of our lives by opening liquor shops in Mumbai. Was that a right decision made by such fools in the state govt?? Why should we Mumbai citizens bear the brunt of such idiotic people running the state???? We will face more of an extended lockdown due to such foolish decisions made by the state govt. Maharashtra CM should resign with immediate effect, he has no choice now. Enough is enough!
When all else fails, resort to exaggerated misinformation.   Tried bribery and corrupted a governor to form a 24 hour govt in the darkness of night.   Dysfunctional governor couldn’t reach a fair decision but played politics while people were dying.  These were not only Maharashtrians but Indians who came to this state as their own states could not provide livelihood.    Governor decides on an election when other options available to spare traumatized  citizens.   First throw out the governor, a puppet.   Is he out on the streets helping the people of the state he is supposed to govern?   Don’t even criticize the Chief Minister.   He was not clapping hands or lighting divas.   He has kept his mouth shut and head bent to the virus he is not responsible for.    The Centre did not heed early warnings.   Where is the Central Home Minister for the past weeks?    Shame on such people who descend to such levels.   Leave our Chief Minister alone.  We need him not the manipulators.
Yes in coming days when u have corona ,ur view will change
The writer is a I’ll informed clown
Have you seen the latest jnfection count in mumbai ? No improvement in fact its gone worse
The writer is a proper bjp lackey . He comes on republic every other day and incoherently espouses the bjp line which republic also endorses . He is a ill informed and inarticulate clown
Let’s have informed clowns speak correct information which is not misquoted in that case!!!!
So the writer is suggesting to hand over to Central government which is twice as incompetent as the Maharashtra government.
Distribute prophylactic Hydroxychloroquine in slums and to all individuals at risk. Secondly, everybody should wear masks. These two steps will reduce the problem by 90%. It’s unfortunate that the state govt chickened out on HCQ distribution, under pressure from anti-national forces.
Playing petty politics at the time of crisis.
Shame on writer
And if failure to handle Covid is a parameter , our honourable PM Modi should resign
Why not our CM? Who is incapable to control corona. He is dancing under the pressure of NCP Congress and their alliance. He does not have any of his own ideas. He is completely failed CM. He should resigned from post. Please stop criticize our honoured Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Why blame the State Government, when Modi was busy gallivanting with Trump in Gujarat and Italian tourists came? Why were the Tablig Jamaat allowed into the county? Even after knowing, why were they allowed to disperse? For that do not blame the Delhi Government. The Delhi Police as well as the airport security is under the Central Government. Was Amit Shah sleeping?  After having brought down the MP Government, now BJP is trying the same in Maharashtra.
This is loose most comment I could read in this entire discussions. Modi has controlled India numbers such that it became as shocking success to world despite non cooperation from few states. So India is doing great despite Jamati played as spoiler and Maharashtra CM behaved useless.
Now come to India numbers, which state are doing great and worst. Maharashtra is worst! More facts are coming out of mismanagement.
The  local community  of these places should take up responsibility  of remaining safe  . A clear example is the tragedy  which took place   at Vizag the local public police  and the administration  was able to  overcome with team work  .  In  Dharavi  Govandi and other places  just the opposite  is happening  .
It’s fact
Nice article with many FACTS.
No surprise that why back to back such uncertainties and situations happened in Maharashtra
Nice article with many FACTS.
This is a completely biased article without any  thought process from start to end. Also comparision of Kerala numbers and Mumbai numbers defies logic.
What is bias in  speaking truth with facts  ? You want a writer from YUVA SENA ? Then approach dumb Aditya and write in Saamana!
This is an attempt to create a negative narrative among the masses against the democratically elected and stable Government of Maharashtra, the writer has deliberately mis-quoted the facts and figures, there are several people like the former Police Commissioner of Mumbai, famous journalist Shobha De, Mahesh Bhatt who have clearly condemned this notion and said that there is no need of Military in Maharashtra
The BJP is playing to repeat MP in Maharashtra this will be a sheer devastation, unlike MP maharashtra’s capital Mumbai is also the financial capital of India and if the BJP doesn’t stop doing politics here then there will be a bigger economic crisis n India.. Wait & watch the fight between Power Greedy party and an democratically elected party….
Truth is always bitter.
“democratically elected and stable Government of Maharashtra” that’s a joke in itself.
The fact is that Maharashtra has got a CM with no previous experience of even being a ward representative. What else can you expect from such a CM and an opportunistic government. God save Maharashtra.
Yes zero experience  just got on throne cozi of his heritage
Democratically elected govt. – joke😂
Maha under the leadership of Uddhavji is doing  far better than any other states.The one who is writing this article is not a good writer.because his state of mind and political biasedness  can easily be  reflected in his article.had he been a good writer he would have tried to express the facts without being exposed  for his mental sickness.
Mumbai and people of Mumbai ..lots of love and blessings.
Mr CM I congratulate you for an all round  wonderful work and clear  directives.people who are criticising either they have no idea about  the demography of the City  or have purposely shut there eyes  shamelessly so that the crisis could be taken to there political advantage.what a shame.thooooooooo
What ?? Read the numbers ever going up and failiour to strict lick down as well as mandatory use of  mask and social distancing where the population is dense . Now during month of Ramadan that will be challenge as NCP and Congress will tie hus hands fir vote bank appeasement but covid 19 spread irrespective of race,religion,region geographical boundaries . India have not enough doctors,nurses,hospitals if even mumbai gets in yo 6 digit and so as in entire maharashtra too. Appeasement will not help to convince dumb crowd of fanatics to follow the guidelines and recent scenario if europe,usa where lockdown and social distancing not observed . He will open next week on pappu logics and india may see 6 digit death numbers only in maharashtra. So wait fir your smart CM to be even smarter .

We are very blessed with such CM… For all timely actions in such complex and extremely situation. We don’t need your opinion…
Badly written article. Writer seems pretty biased.
How much were you paid to write such an biased article?????Why is it that you have failed to show the incompetence of the Central Govt. in terms of procurement of PPE’s and Essential materials to fight COVID 19…..or in terms of blaming the spread of the virus to a particular community…….Timely Allocation of funds and GST refunds which was due to the state…. Why does the state government have to send reminders to the Central government…. We have got the best Chief Minister  of all times in Maharashtra and the people of Maharashtra does not require your expert comments or advice on how Government of Maharashtra needs to handle situations like this ….. Failure to arrest the COVID 19 situation in India at its earlier stage was the failure on the part of the Central Government. Had we prepared ourselves earlier in the month of January-2020 rather than Mid March-2020 the situation would have been much more different in India.
The author is bias person and has no brain to show. This is childish essay written by a person.
He find all faults in uddhav Thackeray & expected from him as he belongs to certain ideology. These Bhakkt only made propaganda of Thali & Diya in Balcony. Now corona virus will vanished from India immediately. This was the statement of so called matured intellectuals bhakts. Has Corona Virus disappeared?? No na? Then now all we say, this is failure of Modiji?  will it do for you? Same logic should be apply while writing the artical. But andha Bhakt will never do that. So lets all ignore what he is saying & appreciate the Maharashtra’s CM Uddhav Thackeray for his honest efforts.
Bring in Army, then pull down Uddhav Thackeray government , impose President’s rule and Finally grab the state,
Ultimate aim is by hook or crook be in power.  This is what this article indicates. This writer is BJP’s media panelist, nothing surprising.
Mumbai and Maharashtra is huge challenge specially in the time of pandemic like Corona and this RashraBhakta people happy to play petty politics.
It is true that Maharashtra is on top as far as Covid 19 cases are concern, because,  highest number of test has been done so far.. And this is not top secret, Whether it Maharashtra or any other state, public health  system is in shambles. In this scenario, opposition should act as a responsible entity, instead BJP eyeing on Shat Pratishat Satta. For the same purpose it  is using main stream media, social media very viciously,  Instigating various groups, this is absolutely against the interest of the nation.  And if this not, then What it is?
Along with Corona failure, Of Uddhav Thackeray, BJP ‘s propaganda machinery busy in targeting Maharashtra CM for Palghar lynching incident. It is absolutely a shameful act both by the Police and local people. But who institutionalize this gruesome act ? who garlanded lynching accused at first place?  who instilled hatred among common people ? Mind you, in Palghar incident, Victim and Accused represents same religion. Read this line again Victim and Accused represents SAME RELIGION, And by the way who are the accused ? These are the same marginalized group, which were and are being used against Muslims for many many years. And who are the Masters? It is every one’s guess…
What nonsense! This article is highly biased and inappropriate. I wonder how ThePrint even allowed it to be published. You cannot compare Maharashtra with any other state in this country. Maharashtra has highest number of migrants, national and international both. Much higher than any other state. It has its own issues. In spite of that, a great share of  cases is related to that one incidence in Delhi. The facts in this article are highly distorted and sound too personal. I condemn this attack on the CM and Maharashtra Government. They are doing a great job.
Grow up, BJP and stop playing politics atleast in this hour of emergency!
Army?!.Articles like these just reduce the credibility of The Print. This was a very agenda based article…. As expected by the The Print.
The author is an covidiot with carona infested brain
It’s good to criticize some one &if merit of criticism is numbers then alone Mumbai has more tests done then any other state alone so that credit goes to udhavji.
Secondly if number of infected is criteria then top leadership of this country is more responsible because the country has 5 times more infections then Mumbai but as an true indian our CM is still with PM and in neither of his addresses has he criticized central govt despite of their baised behaviour
Third why were airports not closed before shutting rail network both are not controlled by CM Udhavji.
so letting infestation inside our country & not allowing our poor to get back to their native places away from infested zone was that Udhavji crime.
Fourth – markaz was permitted by central govt as delhi police report to central not Delhi govt so who is responsible for that fiasco.
Calling in military & stupidly deploying it in infected zones will only intensify the problems
because if this infections do spread through our military then our bastared neighbour pakistan & china would take full advantage of this situation & our country could be in even great danger so let’s rule out military deployment.
Now what can be done then I think day 1 approach taken bu Udhavji of tests & more tests to find & curtail infected people is the best approach if anyone can’t help atleast don’t criticize it.
and as responsible citizen authors political party should ask Mananiya PM to help & provide more test kits to all state govt rather than just dismantling them because “what u sow ……..
Udhavji is doing good with limited resources & coperating with central govt so same is expected from them
And lastly in public interest get this authors brain’s covid test done on war footing as he might infest many more
Hey you author i dont know how  companies hire people like you. @theprint.in if you want i can write much better than this shit that people will actually love. Contact me.

Grow up intelligent. Just because a state has many migrant workers doesn’t mean it should have many cases. The truth is, Uddhav is absolutely incompetent. Why don’t you start off by saying whats so contorted in this?
Tuhin A Sinha is a loser. Looks like a copycat writer with failures in book publishing. Hence he’s taking shade under umbrella of the digital media to protect his value less ideals. It’s easy to criticize than to execute. Which probably Tuhin will never understand cause his biased, insulting words clearly depict his power greedy agenda rather than a sincere journalist’s desire to help the society. FYI, I’m not related to Maharashtra nor to politics. Hence, I can clearly see through his cunning agenda as well as this domain’s.  Such a shame. 
Jai Maharashtra. Jai Hind.
The author should first mention the state and city he resides. Because he doesn’t seem to have any knowledge of the the geography and demographics of Maharashtra and Mumbai. Had he knew this he wouldn’t have written this crap. But can’t  expect anything better than this from a biased and a party spokesperson or panelist which is trying to do politics and trying to be opportunists by unsettling the state government in the time of such pandemic. Question need to be asked to the central government about the permissions granted to some religious events in the time of such crisis. Also the decision of the sudden lockdown without giving any prior information leading to panic situation amongst the migrants and common people in the other states as well as Maharashtra leading to mass gatherings. On the contrary Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray did a planned step by step lockdown in Maharashtra which showed his politIcal acumen and being rational in the times of crisis rather than trying to be a hero by doing big announcements and taking the common people by surprise and fooling them.
Also instead of writing all this, the people of India expect the respected ministers and head of the country to constantly brief them about the current situation of the country and directions for the future the same way how the respected Maharashtra chief minister is doing currently.
Respective Editor ,
The Print. In
Kindly consider deleting this article on immediate basis, it is clearly biased & the facts aren’t taken in consideration.
Or else please be ready to face Section 505(1) of Indian Penal Code, 1860
1. I can see that clearly BJP and it’s people are feeling the burn on Uddhav’s progress that’s why they the dogs on BJP are barking
2. Let’s clearly report this on twitter so that the print account is blocked
Sold media
We r feeling pity as we are Maharashtrian and can’t do anything when our people bare dying just for this mis management.
Lol… Buddy, I have been feeling the same since the last 6 years.. Feeling pity, sitting on the sidelines, unable to do anything, while the country goes into total ruin.. Before judging Uddhav, judge Modi. The migrant crisis is totally on his hands.. And now these fools are demanding for presidents rule in Maharashtra.. I agree that Uddhav is not performing well, but giving the command to Modi, will be a horror inducing nightmare!!
Ppl playing politics at this pandemic time shows what type of man he is…. poison for society…udhhavji is doing great job…taking into consideration the population of the city… comparing 1 state to other is wrong…Kudos to Kerala for the way they hv managed but they hv very less number of slum, migrants,nd population too…so shame on the writer
Sir kuch MP ke baare mein bhi kahiye
Highly biased and non sensual article, politically motivated against an opposition ruled state, clear purpose is to find excuse for dismissing the Govt and put central rule. What union govt has done for providing food to 400 million poor starving population who are locked in slums and may either die of hunger or other epidemics.
Dear Nirmala Agarwal,
Central Government never dismiss any of the state Governments in India, because this is not Indira government ot under Congress rule. Maharashtra is one the wealthiest state in India and Thakerey is a vergin CM and his present position only for a LUXUARY to prove his dignity.
Kerala is ruled by an opposition party,  CPM. Kerala also ranked in first for killings in between BJP and CPM. There are thousands of reasons to dismiss CPM government. But it will not happen as Indira government and rule in congress party in the past.
Today, Kerala is ranked first, once again for Covid management and relief. Most of the International medias and health organisations had congratulated our CM for his covid management and efferts for stopping covid death. Kerala holds  lowest Covid death, comparing with other states in India. Our CM have no experience in state administration and his chief ministership is the first time like Therey. But our CM has a managing power or commanding power to control a group of ministers  from different political parties, which Thakerey haven’t.
Finally and once again I remind you, there no hidden agenda with BJP or NDA to dismiss any government in India at present and / or in future. Because   all state governments are safe in the hands of Modiji.
People of India are made up of this political views which are absolute non sense. See the intention of a person who wants to play vote bank politics in such calamities shame of you writer
The views are personal backed by political mind.  Had it been other party government the situation would have been same. The present CM is doing very well by carrying with him two other parties with totally different ideology.  The observation by the writer bound to be nagative as they can only see the nagative.
Hahahhahahaha.

The author is either from whatsapp university’s or from Godhi media, it’s shame on him, creating such kind of useless statements, on my view if the international flights were stopped much earlier,  and if not given permission for jamat in nizamuddin, both were under the preview of central government, today India would have not faced such critical circumstances, according to me though it was known to the government that Covid19 was a pandemic decease, which was born in China and people migrated from China even after it was known that it’s transmitted through human, India would have announced the ban on international travelling, like Singapore did and they are safe.
I think US President Donald Trump was to visit for namasthe India, so the country allowed foreign travelling. 
The author might be settled in RSS camp since the lockdown, so he doesn’t know the ground reality, he might also written on basis of Republic and TIMES NOW  news, which does the same kind of untruthful allegations on the opposition parties countrywide
I really and Very truly accept and portrayed the real picture of Mumbai at present which every citizen is aware of, every point mentioned in this article is questioning sensible minds. Who is going to give justified answers and actions on all mentioned incidents.

I appreciate the writer. Perfect and to the poin
According to me one dhed doosaraa kasai.  When it comes to snatching seats all are same! But thousand times better than the party ruled for so many years with monopoly!
Also it is upto us to follow rules and observe discipline. Media is the worst in this situation! Rather then helping always searches for a scoop!
Maharashtra also comes under central government what central government me is doing for Mumbai…. PM is effectively working on Tali Bajao  and diye jalao.  Biased media…
Why blame modhiji for the sortcoming in state administration. Lockdown has been successfull in containing corona in other states but not in maharastra. As reported there is no coherency in governing parties and the big lossers  are the common people’s. There are big list of sponsored tweeters who blindly blame modhiji for political reasons instead of suggesting ways to contain the infection. Some of the tweets are just photo copies . Please stop this instead find ways to copup with the serious situation. Otherwise history will not excuse.
Accha,please write about Gujarat which has jumped to number three position with 1743 cases and 53 deaths. Shame on you for playing politics amid crisis.
What else is expected from such people???like you
What’s  in  name.
Uddava cannot be blamed. In this crisis all
X chief ministers are responsible  as other states citizens  were attracted  for  self esteem &good settle down in their culture  ethic  and mental strength of minting money   in shorter periods  since  independence, due to which this crowded city  like dharavi emerged

It’s a shame. Liberals are hypocrits .How  come secular ppl are supporting shiv Sena. How come Muslims and Christians supporting shiv sena. Do you guys forgot the shiv Sena past. Looks like  people forget past if it matches their opinion.
Brave son of a Brave father. The sword in hand will shine and the loosers will be defeated. Amit shah and phadnavis simultaneously playing tricks with PM .SATTA BAAJI. In maharashtra. 15th school colleges close for covid19 forming of MPgovt 23rd. 24th airports close PM cheater.liar.beggar. 1st Congress  now Corona later Congress. Beggars no CHOICE .
Mr. Uddhav Thackeray is doing great job. Shameless people are playing politics. Uddhav ji keep it up. We the people of Maharashtra with u,  Always.
Pehle follow toh karo fir kaho support karte ho!!!!!!
Medical Staff and Police men par hamle par hamle…..Aur yaha badi badi baatein……
How can you be so biased and state something like that. Who are you to judge him. The tittle of your blog is totally misleading. The way how Mr.CM is handling the situation is noteworthy. Just because someone has fed u enough you have no rights of making false comments.
After all what could be expected from a biased writer of the bjp party. Our chief mister is doing the best he could considering the population and diverse area of Mumbai. And we are proud of him .
This post is coming repeatedly in recent news section showing being posted “just few minutes ago”.  Definitely it’s a political propoganda. Kindly ignore this blog.

Complete bias article by so called BJP puppet
. What the hell is he comparing Kerala with Mumbai. During such worst situation too BJP/BJP puppets are trying to blame Sena in Mumbai. Further such authors must be banned from writing any such article henceforth. People in mumbai are very much aware what the situation is and how CM and Mumbai police is contributing to control it. This is not the time to play politics but to share true and correct news among mass.
Mr Tuhin Sinha the author is a BJP member. Nothing more to talk. Sad to see such views from opposition and that too facilitated by the print in such a National emergency and world pandemic.
You can’t compare the population of Kerala with that of Mumbai. I’m sure the author have zero knowledge about Mumbai slums. I’m basically from Kerala working in Mumbai as a nurse. I can evaluate both state and I don’t see anything to blame Maha govt in any of their actions. It was clear to everyone (even before first case reported) that once virus gets to Mumbai slums it will be difficult to contain it. And with large number of international arrivals its a easy slip through. Simple question to the author since its made clear that you are some kind of person related to bjp, why don’t central govt restricted incoming international flights before march 22 and why was the lockdown declared so late given that the first case reported one month before .
So its not the time for blame game. Just see India in front and its Tru colour, instead of party flags for some time at least
Fully biased article. State Govt has 2 tasks: tackle Covid 19., & also tackle the bribed media
The author is a media panelist of BJP.  Playing dirty politics in the time of a crisis. Shame.
Clearly burnol is needed.

Thank you Mr Uddhav Thakrey for Good work.
Clearly biased views .. search for this writer on google and you will see this
“He is presently a national media panelist of the BJP and represents the party as spokesperson”
What else can we expect from a party which was busy shopping MLA’s while corona was entering the country.
I am glad… That uddhav sir, took such a step not thinking about the negative things gonna be said by people for him….
Guys v need help in any form to help ourselves our people our country….
So why don’t we just leave aside bitterness of any sought and just help by thinking positive….
Don’t think about any caste creed or origin…
Just pray for the best…
Jai Hind
First of All Mr. Sinha, I disagree with you totally, you being a BJP spokesperson saying this is not political is absolute bullshit and you need to show solidarity instead of blaming the govt of Maharashtra. Secondly, let me inform you there is a big difference between Maharashtra and Kerala’s population for you to compare. Thirdly, CM of Maharashtra has done his best not only handling migrants but also keep them fed. According to me, he has done a commendable job. Also, if you would like to compare, why don’t you bring Gujarat in the figures, have you seen the recent spike. Please before writing your articles, do a little research, don’t talk in thin air. I hope you understand the seriousness of what you say and do. Don’t be a blind fool tooting a donkeys horn.
Who is successful accordingly to theprint ?
Have you any story about M.P Gujarat ?? No, because they have succeeded ? The answer is no.
Sree Sekhar Gupta for whom I have great respect but now I am watching him and feel he became baised and speaking truth to the power.
It is very sad as a reader and viewer
Your article is very biased. Maharashtra government is working very effectively. U can’t see other states? What about Gujarat? What about MP? In MP there is no health Minister at all. U can’t see that? Pls don’t play politics at such time.
I am nearing 59 years, born and brought up in Mumbai, currently residing in Thane.
While one writer’s comments could be biased others are equally biased.
Instead of giving point by point correct figures to prove that the article has only wrong figures blame game is played. Defend CM is fine but why bring PM and Delhi CM.
Difficult for the country to improve till it’s people improve. JAI MAHARASHTRA, JAI HIND
Samajkaran is the foundation of the Shiv Sena not Rajkaran.Understand the length and breadth of social work done by Shiv Sena in maharashtra.CM communication work is commendable in this crisis.
High density per sq km and crowded slums/localities is an issue and this covid will create havoc.Stay home and safe.This too shall pass.
Biased
Then what about M. P.
It seems that the writer is trying to creat background for another oath ceremony of CM and Deputy CM in the early hours of day. But he has miserably failed since common man knows the factual position.
We are not trusted your news. Maharashtra Government and Uddhav Thackeray doing good job
Completly Disagree with the writer’s opinion . Our CM Uddhav Ji is doing a very  good job and we totally support him. Nothing More to say on this.
This guy is BJP party member, what else you can expect from him? Why don’t he write about MP, UP, Gujarat and similar states managed by his own party? I doubt his knowledge of Mumbai geography. While India is fighting Corona virus people like him are fighting Indians. What a shame. Why print is providing platform to such people who in the time of crisis is seeking political mileage? Is it really print or some fake website in the name of print. Shame.
‘Chaatukaarita’ at its best. Aaj ahmedabad acceleration mode mein aagaya. Yeh soch raha hoga k kash yeh article likhne se pahle 2 din aur ruk jata..   delhi me haalat kharaab hai, indore bhi exploding k kagaar par hai.
Isn’t the articles in print undergo review before being published, the articles doubts the credibility of The print.
Nonsense
Tablighi jamaat meet was okayed by the central govt and this members have reached every part of the country they should have been stopped at Delhi itself and quarantined  by the Delhi police . This people became super spreaders at dharavi resulting in increase in cases in Maharashtra
By the same measure, the Narendra Modi government should also resign for its failure to prevent the covid19 from spreading in India.
Uddhav Thackeray  is mature & sensible person & under the guidance of experienced Sharadji Pawar  can tackle the situation Very well. BJP leaders who feel that Thackeray has failed to manage situation can request PM to help the state or PM directly can decide to help. If in Maharashtra there would be BJP led government then centre’s plan of action for help wouldn’t have changed.
BY THE SAME MEASURE, THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO RESIGN FOR ITS FAILURE TO PREVENT THE COVID19 IN INDIA
Whoever the writer is ……
‘Shame in you “
Completely BJP sponcered opinion…
Maharashtra govt has done fabulous job till date , we are highest in country for testing with containment zones demarked. Only Mumbai and Pune is severely hit that too because of slums for which a six months CM shd not be held responsible. And if the author feels to get army , then what suggestions he has for US and Europe ?Calling for army is a desrespect to our State Police & BMC who are working despite minimal resources.
Considering mumbai vastness and varied life style coupled with global connection,the situation for covid is grim.The government is trying level best to contain, but it is need of hour to not let any relief in lockdown for mumbai, as done by Delhi govt.
Biased, one sided journalism
Biased, one sided journalism, we are mumbaikar we know how uddhav Thackeray is handling he is the best C. M. I have seen so far
The article is written by BJP media panelist. 
So it means this website The Print is run by BJP. Please learn journalism.. it should be unbiased. You are simply doing BJPs job. 
Shameless journalism.
The comments looks like more political. I would suggest rather than criticizing, help each other to get out of this extreme situation. You can play the blame game rest of your lives.  This is the time when we should stand as ONE and not divided.
You might be paid to write something  of this sort .  Your story is utter nonsense and false. Udhav Thakare is very well for the state in his capacity ..by the way there is no need of army at this stage in the state as situation  is still under control . And government is carrying out proactive tests with people for corono virus.
seriously???? 
This writer is BJP member as it says at the end of the article.
Cant believe this nonsense 😂😂
Utter nonsense and biased views
Mr.Uddhav Thakrey is doing A Fantastic Job Responsibily,in these worst situation,We should support all the Good Initiatives of the Government of Maharashtra.JAI MAHARASHTRA  JAI HIND
Why can’t these people stop playing politics at this time. Does the writer know what is Mumbai’s population. In Mumbai besides the counted population there are thousands of migrant labourers who have left their home town like UP Kerela MP and many more states and these labourers have hope in Mumbai as it gives them their bread. The state of Maharashtra has soapy industries and here also there are many workers who are not fro Maharashtra. So to manage such a large population in the time of pandemic is not a joke. A country like US is finding it difficult to manage this situation and this political writer is blaming the CM of Maharashtra. Maidan mai aao Sir, phir baat karna. Ghar baitkar kuch bhi likhne se kaam nahi chalega
Cyber cell please get this article off asap, its creating a rift  a bias article.
Are you kidding me the state having 2 airports featuring in list of top 10 in terms of air traffic.
Mumbai alone saw most number of people coming from abroad.
Is it his fault that he graciously welcomed them back to their homeland.
Maharashtra has done maximum tests hence they have traced maximum covid cases.
You can’t simply politicise every damn thing.
Sometimes you just have to stand behind your PM & CM in the time of emergency.
It’s easy to play blame games, please don’t do that.
Typical BJP double faced approach. While Maharashtra government is doing far better than Modi’s national government. He doing far better than Modi. They will request opposition to co-operate and not criticize. Even will put people who oppose in jail, they are given a free hand to politicise issues elsewhere. If things go right credit is modi’s. If they fail, need a scapegoat. Opposition parties, persons, religions.
Very biased and nonsensical article. I’m not sure, the author has ever been to Mumbai. Matter of fact, youou can’t compare Mumbai with any state or city in India. The influx of people and the density in some areas of mumbai is astonishing. So, plese stop this naive and baseless comparison. Maharashtra government is doing its best with whatever supplies they have. Ppe kits are insufficient, and central government not able to provide them to Maharashtra government on time. State government is arranging PPE kits of their own. This shows why there’s delay in the testing process. Our CM is taking at most care and measures as he could.
Considering, the population and living density, any non-expert will also tell you that Maharashtra (Mumbai) will be more affected. We appreciate that the number is still within control because of the measures taken by State government and BMC. State government is going door to door in Dharavi to check covid positive people. What else you expect. We don’t have sufficient man power and kits but that is everywhere and central government making sure to send those equipment ASAP (hope so). Don’t say that Maharashtra is worstly affected, we Mumbaikars know, how bad things could have been. So, stop spreading misinformation and do thorough research before writing such kind of article. 
Conclusion, One of the worst articles ever. Please stop spreading biased personl views and creating panic in this situation.

Don’t know what you are smoking…
But the Maharashtra State is doing a wonderful job.
Most of the Cases are from the migrant labors who don’t want to follow the rules and just want to spread the virus,
Why the hell didi they gather outside Bandra station?
why is Dharavi still not shut?
Any Conspiracy by the opposition???
The CM is still managing to maintain the situation in a calm and composed manner, unlike others out there.
Giving the information that is needed, and talking to the point.
Very biased views , without any substantial info comments are made,  state administration are good job. Writter did not wrote one things how was inflow of flights to india. 26000 fliers came from arab countries and more than 10 lakhs, which airports did these fliers came kerla or rajsthan ?
Firstly great usage of words and therefore good vocabulary. Secondly, it looks biased but very well written and anyway Uddhavji is doing his part of performing CM but he has to take certain actions against people like Awhad and Amitabh Gupta. Rest, all depends upon people and its better to stay away from politics. But overall, very well written
Pls dont blame him he is doing his best.
People should understand d situation
Government of Maharashtra doing absolutely good work and handling the situation very very seriously and effectively. He does not appear on the TV screens moment by moment but he is administering very well. My personal request to the writer and all to come together and fight the corona virus collectively irrespective of political differences.
This my personal opinion.
The print! For heavens sake stop like stop promoting so much hate. You say you are unbiased In reporting? I guess that’s not true. You are equally the problem that you once used to report on. And what’s the point in pushing this article out again and again on google searches for 2/3 days non stop. We don’t wanna read your garbage cos this isn’t journalism or An opinion, it’s a propaganda.
The writer, it appears, has never seen core areas of Mumbai like at Daravi, Worli, Mahim etc. This is a total irresponsible journalism. This is the time for the entire humanity on this Earth to come together to fight the epidemic. Shame on such article, that too, during such tough times. Author needs to be sent to New York by first available charter.
सिन्हा साहेब तुम्हाला कोणी सांगितले कि उद्धवजी अपयशी ठरलेत कोरोना रोखण्या मध्ये आपण जर उद्धवजी ची आजची दुपारी एक वाजताची मुलाखत बघितली असती तर असे स्टेटमेंट दिले नसते काही जण आहेत की ज्यांना उद्धवजी जे चांगले काम करत आहेत ते बघवत नाही त्यामुळे कोणताही विचार मांडताना जरा विचार करावा नाहीतर शिवसैनिकांना माहिती आहे की जशास तशाला कसे उत्तर द्यायचे ते… जय महाराष्ट्र
The writers views are not seem to be his personal..it’s full of criticism..it’s anti MH state govt.The CM of Maharashtra is doing a marvelous job in fight against spread of virus…why the writer is comparing Mumbai or Maharashtra with another.Is he aware of complexities of Mumbai..how people stay in concentrate conditions.All the ministers and the local administrations including police and doctors are discharging thier optimum in controlling the situation..It is pity and shameful on the writers part for delivering such  poisonous thoughts under the pretext of personal views..I think he’s not a person at all..Shame on him whatever he is apart from a person..
the author is a BJP media panelist, and his veiw are obviously going to be biased.
 The problem is @print to allow him to write for you, this clearly exposes your bias.
One more media painted with BJP colour. Very sad

It’s not right to compare Mumbai with that if Kerala, look at the population and no of migrants who are struggling on daily basis for food, moreover Dharavi is densly populated slum area in Mumbai.
I think Mr. Thackeray as CM is doing his job quite sincerely and urging people to be at home, probably currently he is one of the best CM’s we have in country.
This news agency is as stupid as this article ! Mumbai is a very Massive case when it comes to epidemics like these, thanks to the outsiders that don’t even listen to the government. Uddhav ji is handling it very well. It’s people outside of Maharashtra that are creating havoc in Mumbai. You are bringing nothing but politics to the plate even in crisis like this !
Uddhav Thakre has failed on more than one front.
He has failed to protect the fundamental right to Education of the children, by putting the children’s future at risk.

Uddhav Thakre has failed on more than one front.
He has failed to protect the fundamental right to Education of the children, by putting the children’s future at risk.
I have raised this issue on twitter also but, neither Uddhav Thakre sir nor Varsha Gaikwas Madam has bothered to clarify.
Please go out of the house and see the situation before supporting the Govt. They have enough money to build statues but no money for medical facilities. There is no single bed available in any Mumbai hospital. Only ones suffering is the common man whereas people with political contacts are still managing to get the beds in hospitals. Please check what is actually happening outside and then support your Govt blindly.
I agreed
You are right they just bring politics into everything, to handle such a grave matter,money is need and the central government can only helps the bjp run states
The writer here has not considered population factor. While he gives eg of kerela it shouldn’t be neglected that Maharashtra’s population is 10 times more than kerela. According to that aggregate testing in maharashtra is done as per the current capacity.
This is what some people are good at and some people are paid for writing. At this crsis I don’t know how people can try to think of only blaming one side. The article is political in nature. In fact if the author is just ignoring the fact that the central government was also late to put the ban on the international visitors. So I think this article should not be taken seriously as it is one sided and politically motivated article. I think the readers are wise enough to understand the agenda of the writer.
The man heading the govt in Maharashtra has no administrative experience. How do you expect him to handle the present pandemic which is unprecedented.
He does not control the State Home Ministry and State Health Ministry , both must be reporting to Pawar who is a shrewd player and will do everything to keep the CM in check….and to top up his troubles ,
his top advisor is his son who himself has no experience either in politics or administration. In fact the son was called Pappu of Maharashtra by a news channel.
Have u seen a person directly appointed as DGP or the Chief of Army or Secretary to the govt or Chief Engineer or the Chairman of  a Bank or VC of a University….the answer is NO.
Why? Because you have to start at the lowest rung and gain knowledge and experience over the years before u are appointed to a position of absolute responsibility and decision making.
I reiterate the present CM and his top advisor have
neither the political acumen nor the administrative skills to provide resolute leadership in such difficult times. Unless the Central Govt interjects and seizes the bull by the horns , these two nimcumpoops will lead the State to a point of no return.
Yessssss exposure experience and expertise lacking
Stop politicising  the issue. In a densely populated city like Mumbai, Mr Thackeray has done a fair job and more importantly there is a sincere effort by him.  But what about most of the dense people who do not understand the seriousness  of this virus issue and break the rules formulated to stop the spread of the virus.
Well said !! Absolutely right   .no one  has right to pin point  our Maharashtra government . Udhavji is trying his best . He will definitely over come all this problems ,if central government gives financial support. The author is a BJP supporter so naturally  he has to criticize
Insane,dumb, insensitive and biased article.
Oh this Author seem very bias an agent of central govt. He should have also pointed out Central Government Failure on Corina virus part??? When first case was reported in December 2019 instead of getting on top of it Central Government was busy hoisting n numbers of events which we all know. Namaste Trump has many foreigners visiting our country and there after so on…….
I think Author Mr. Sinha has written one side of story he should have pointed out the weakness and Negligence part of Central Government there last event was MP soon after CM Mr. Shivraj Chouhan taken over oath they declared Janta Curfew followed by Lock down.
This is not the time to pinpoint, Let’s come together and fight with this Virus and I am sure as an Indian we can win together..
Jai Hind…
Time to get the corona virus down not politicing it .
Author should first check high mortality rate or Gujarat state.
Kerala has advantage of small state and having more and better medical staff especially nursing team which helped to curtail hence more revival and recovery. Maharastra is a complex state where lot of factors are involved. At this moment no change of guard, Central support is full. State should avail the benifits and act fast.Better to deploy army in hot zone areas to contain the pandemic in state.  Public should follow the instructions as laid by. There are some negligency by people. Casual labour stuck in state , make proper arrangement for thier food, stay. As after lock down, business  will affect due to shortge of labour force.All parties should join heads and fight  during this crisis. Regards.
Looks like a well paid article by the BJP. If army was the answer to everything. Why have PM too? Just let the army run the country. The problem with our country is everyone knows the problems, very few have courage to solve them or attempt to solve them
Phadnavis……keep your comments for your self…..we don’t need any ADVISE from you and your Dumb Leader….cocenstrate on the Economy, Job, GDP…..you people have distructed  it, your leader is solely RESPONSIBLE
..
Uddhav is 1st time CM and just a couple of months 
He is leading a collation government, which is very tricky
He is well versed with Mumbai and close to western Maharashtra, Pune however relatively unfamiliar with Vidarbh, North Maharashtra many other regions 
Few ministers in NCP, no need to name them are just trying to score points and waiting for opportunity for political benifits 
Mumbai is overpopulated with migrant workers staying in horrible filthy conditions which is incomparable with any other city
BMC thought well in control of Shiv Sena have it’s long inherent issues like severe corruption 
We also know few areas slum areas like Mumbra, Dharavi and Bandra east are encouraged vote banks by pseudo secular politicians which are hotspots of Covid as of now 
Considering the above Udhhav deserves some more time and support from all sections of society
Clear biased views. The writer is getting too personal!
Truth hurts!Ground reality says bring in NSA to make sure everyone is masks and there are not more then 4 people to congregate.We have to stop nspread of Corona Virus and forget about politics.
Author has used outdated, selective data to mislead & Print has published the same.
– Maharashtra government is publishing death percentage every day. The official figures show, it is less than world average & not the highest even in India. In many backward states people die before testing, body disposed without postmortem  & do not get counted in their statistics.
Testing density of Maharashtra may be lower than Kerala & Rajasthan but much higher than most other states.
The spread in Mumbai & surrounding area is very high compared to all India average but Mumbai cannot be compared to rest of India except Delhi. It is still better than New York, London & many mega-cities that do not have slums like Mumbai has. Current government did not create those slums.
Nothing wrong in taking help of army but no biased misinformation, please.
Khichri sarkar ki khichri management.Directionless.This is not a democraticall elected alliance .If they had guts ,should have sought reelection.
Anyway
They should be serious.Call army or paramilitary .
And do what, can you please enlighten us how will the paramilitary forces help?
The article seems completely biased and trying to demean the efforts putin by the CM and team.
Moreover the comparison is baseless as there are a lot of dissimilarities between these two states, be it population or any other demographic factor.
Just because You support BJP(Bhakt Viewpoint quite clear) doesn’t mean You have the right to speak about a situation which was very much bought into the attention of PM in January by many opposition leaders and journalists as well. “Kichiri” waha se hi shuru hui h.
@Print, very much biased story full like your pen has borrowed ink from someone else. Uddhav Thackeray is doing very well and it’s utter nonsense to compare Kerala and Maharashtra. Myself being a keralite settled in Mumbai we know the ground reality. There is a world of difference between the two states
Completely political views. People shall understand the mentality behind.why some body having enough resources shall wait till the local authority’s ask for it?
Why only Maharashtra?
Does any body know the population density in Mumbai,Thane and Pune as compared to Indore in MP ?
I realised I have wasted time in reading. People may have free time to write such ..
Completely agree with u
He has written all facts & numbers ..so what is political in it ? The death rate of Pune is almost 10% !! highest in world ..what more proof you need ?
This is what the some writes are good at. Just using the media and mislead the people and put their own parties political agenda forward. The facts are presented in a negative way. And if the author’s party is so much vigilent then why the precautions were started so late. I think we need to writers who are unbaised and write in the interest of the people and not party.
Very truly portrayed the real picture of Mumbai at present which every citizen is aware of, every point mentioned in this article is questioning sensible minds. Who is going to give justified answers and actions on all mentioned incidents.
I appreciate the writer. Perfect and to the point
If at all this can be reported or any online FIR can be filed I’ll do that.
The language used in this article is inappropriate.
It is misleading as it’s from BJP.
And the comparisons made are also inappropriate.
p
cant blame any state for the preparedness of this careless and ugly disease, maharashtra govt was very well prepared due to some miscreants ,dont wont to follow the guidelines of the same r to be blamed ,only issue a circular for the private schools to atleast half the fees for the first term rather than issuing for the landlords as many tenants r benefitted with their salary in this period
Please keep your political hate agendas aside…people now very much understand what your party is doing in Maharashtra. If you worry so much, please request center to send army and give money, grain for migrants from central government stores, test kits and PPE to help state government. Don’t sit at home and write anything to confuse people. Crisis has shown your party’s reality to people and it’s thinking limitations
Those who support shiv sena should first read this report
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bjp-shiv-sena-sion-hospital-bmc-covid-19-dead-bodies-6398252/
This author seems to be biased towards one political party,  Mumbai have lot of migrants and cannot be compared to Kerala. If one been to Kerala Malayalam  is predominately written, spoken in the state. People who reside there are the natives of the state, in mumbai  people have migrated  from different states. I don’t understand why people of other states are not developing their states to save mumbai from getting overcrowded, once this stops mumbai numbers will start dwindling, and so do corona cases. Maharashtra CM is sincere,  focused on what needs to be done. Please don’t teach others what needs to be done, rather focus on solution against corona.

Agree ,we have a intelligent CM and I am sure he is doing his 200% to take care of the situation. Its foolish to compare Maharashtra with other states. Most of is has faith in him .
Tiger Being Cuddled By Sugar Baron With A Helping HAND.
Read more…you are spectacularly uninfomed about India’s healthcare system…we were already understaffed and overpopulated….Mumbai’s slum are the epicenter of every heakth crises that has ever occured. And even a novice epidemiologist could have predicted this  happening in mumbai during any kind of pandemic….stop making it a political thing and do something productive.
Instead of writing this article, you should have suggested this to your dear Prime Minister & asked him to send 1 lakh military troops & 10 lakh test kits & PPEs because state resources are depleting. It would be better if the centre govt start help state instead of their party spokesperson criticising the state govts.
Only talk no walk….
I am no party man but just a normal Mumbaikar ………
Mr Tuhin does not seem to understand is that this is politics what he is trying to play during this crisis, when human lives are endangered. if he is a Mumbaikar then he should understand that Uddhavji is doing his best and staying conditions of Mumbai cannot be compared to any region in the entire world …. all other state CM’s are lucky that they need to control only 20% of outsiders but here Udhavji has to handle almost 70% of outsiders including foreign nationals ….. if Mr Tuhin is so bent on condeming the ways of Udhavji’s handling situation then he should first condemn the Delhi team, both Central and State as they could not together handle the Tablighees and the Gurudwara incident ….. which gave a solid boost to Corona and maximum in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu ….
Considering the upteen types of people to be handled in Mumbai, the concerned Maharashtra CM … whoever he or she maybe (not only Udhavji) shud be given consideration and therefore all parties need to stand as one at this moment and ensure rules are followed strictly so that Mumbai is made safe once again
The next few days are critical for BJP’s future.
”The author is a writer and a national media panelist of the BJP. Views are personal.”
Foot note says it all
If the writer, still young, has any traces of brains, has to be sanitized to come to senses.
He can then offer how to decongest Dharavi and other slum pockets. 
This is an opportune moment to rehabilitate and rescue the most industrious, but miserable populace of Dharavi. Same with other slums.
One of the slumlords, a tabelawala has joined the ‘mainstream’ party and bought protection for his fishing-in-the-muck industry.
Phadnavis govt has done nothing to solve the slum proliferation problem in 5 years. 
Tuhin Sinha must be booked for disturbance and spreading public fear.

How bias !!!
The writer should visit to understand the complexity of Dharavi before writing such an article. The spread of the virus can be curtailed if there is distancing. What kind of distancing does this writer except around slums in Mumbai where there is sometimes just a plastic sheet for a wall… Also clapping & lighting Diyas will not reduce the spread of the virus either. Neither was it a cake walk in Delhi when the lockdown was announced. Migrants had to move on foot & in close proximity, some losing their lives out sheer exhaustion due to lack of food & water…
There are. Expert Content writer if we tell them to writer articles that emphasize particular topic they write with statistics and highlight which changes view of the reader.. this above news is true example of that.. this paid media has ruined our nation .
Very upset with title.. a person having no experience of any Mantripad is handling this pandemic crisis and you are saying he’s failed.
No. Absolutely wrong. He’s on the way of victory. When he’ll win please appreciate his efforts, same like you criticize.
Absolutely negative  media trial
Kindly dont try to distract CM and his Efforts in covid war  this pathetic criticism in this  rough times  is no true picture of journalism He is absolutely doing his very best  Do also take view on  there is enough support for maharashtra
n you will understand who is playing foul n stop your such media bombing and tarnishing image and sincere efforts of Maharashtra  CM UT
The facts and figures ate to the mark. Lockdown was a very excellent opportunity to sped up and do tests all across Maharashtra on large scale. But no the government is not interested in that. the government is sitting there with closed eyes thinking that virus will go away.
Dharavi was not an  Akash Ganga for many years to pour water through tap to every family. So earlierFadnavis Govt. also to be blamed for the today’s Maharashtra including Dharavi. What about Kalburgi Car festival  gatherings of thousands, please  write ,Sir, Now we all have to learn from Kerala of India and Cuba who are talking lessons to the world. And Centre is opening its purse with  Rs 15000/- crores giving per head Rs112/- not even enough for one day morning breakfast.Tax rich atleast 1% is enough to get 100000 crores.
Please correct the fact and compare the affected number of people and total population of Mumbai pandemic growth is negligible. State government is doing its best to contain the spread and thoughtfully taking steps. CM is taking atmost care of all areas in Mumbai. No state in India is so multicultural, multilingual, thus taking in consideration the thinking, habits and daily routines of people best efforts are putforth.
We cannot deny the fact that number of people come into Mumbai for livelihood only, they merely appreciate or care for Mumbai’s / states governments efforts to make it better place. Naturally,  people do think if their basic goal of coming in Mumbai is hampered there is no need care/ appreciate about Mumbai until then they would stay not complain a bit. 
Overall writer is BJP spokesperson and may be  residing in Mumbai for livelihood thus he is doing his job. I request him to convey message to Central Government to help our State government to overcome the situation without holding grudges of not being in hold of state and look into requests made by state government starting from SGST share to be immediately transferred in state government treasury.
You cant blame the state govt. I believe they are doing their job. The issue is Mumbai is one of the denseley populated cities in India. In Mumbai 1bhk is a luxury. The city is filled with people from other parts of the state as well as the country. If the decision was to lockdown for morethan a month. I think central govt could have given a two or three day prior notice to the lockdown such that people might have gone to their native and the density could have been reduced. By chance anyone who travelled from mumbai got COVID then i believe more than a month is enough to identify and treat the cluster or individual.
Such biased and baseless articles should not be allowed to be published, Bjp is frustrated and finding any possible means to malign state governments image and great leadership.
Would the writer give serious thought of analysing situation in Madhya Pradesh also a big State, which does not have a Health Minister and Gujaràt and come out with data and percentage. It’s high time when Disaster Management Act should be strictly used against writers whose biased opinion may adversely affect the psyche of people
Such a foolish title and the article itself. You can keep on banging utensils and lit diyas rather than writing such an irresponsible, unethical and away from the facts stuff.
What about Gujrat and M.P. where migrants are less compared to Maharashtra. What is international Air traffic in those state still they are having large number. You are saying the same language of Narayan Rane. On 12th Feb you were knowing the situation why you allowed flights.
Bhakt…shame on you PRINT
Bad article. Childish comparisons. Author is a BJP worker trying to gain attention.
Godi media
Godi media
Absolutely biased article . Appears like Godi media
Tuhin A. Sinha  failed to write a report about coronavirus unprejudiced. Bring in better journalists to save The print 🙂
What do you expect from BJP crony? Given the situation in Mumbai in particular and Maharashtra in general, Uddhav Thackeray has done a good job.
Bjp needs burnol….dats all
Author is biased as he is BJP member
Author is writer and national media panelist of BJP …this says it all. 🤔 #modibhakt
Compare the India data and statistics with Us and Italy , Till now we have manage properly comoare to them
So far Uddav Thackeray is properly managing Maharashtra.
And yes things are getting out of control but When Modi CANNOT manage The Whole INDIA, Uddhav Thackeray is not solely responsible for Managing the Entire Maharashtra .
Author is biased and he is BJP member
First of all, Lets not make the crisis a blame game.
This article looks so one handed, clearly looks like paid one and after putting such big heading that Thackeray has failed at last you guys put the author is BJP worker at some corner in small letters.
SHAME on you ThePrint!
Stupid article…… please verify the real fact with who is working at gressroit level PPL…..and then write…thakare is one of the best CM we got after long time….his work related covid 19 is very appreciative….
Background of writer is showing that he will write like this only. Very biased article. Highest foolishness is comparision of kerala with Maharashtra. CM of Maharashtra is doing good job and majority of common people are with Uddhav Thackre so nobody will bother for such type of articles..
Are you in hurry to declare someone as a failure. This is not right time to do so. If in future, we need army to protect Mumbai, still don’t need to panic, government selected by the people of Maharashtra, is doing great job for Maharashtra.
Godi media and paltu dog of BJP
Somehow the fact that 40% of mumbai population stays in slums is overlooked Delhi doesn’t have similar division yet has high figures No one asking for Delhi CM to resign or call for Army Empty pockets and stomachs need to be handled tactfully not forcefully I hope Medua will use greater  discretion
This is BJP agenda for operation lotus after MP now they want to take advantage of this situation. Central government also look bias for bjp ruled states and others. And even oppositions corporators and MLA’S breaking lockdown rules in Maharashtra first of all control them later give suggestions to state government on corona because Uddhav Thackeray and Rajesh Tope doing fabulous job.
Now we know the real agenda of through this BJP person, take the country to emergency and bring it under military rule especially all opposition ruled states. Central govt was sleeping till mid march even when 1 st case reported in Jan.  MP govt was toppled in March and Parliament kept running till march 22. Total lockdown is the easiest decision to take but to manage the economy will be big failure like after demo and GST rollout
Uddhavji doing very very good job. I think you are bias writing against Uddhav Thakre and Maharashtra government.
Marathi people and marathi mind no one change simple way understand uddhav thackera sir well doing job but indian half mad political people mind no one change all indian want fast result no one want homecorontile or lockdown situation indian people not thought india, indian people think or other bjp sponcer people think uddhav thackera not doing well job but my answer is corona virus is not understand all world and why blame to uddhav sir i dont no , indian many poor people many people have no house or no two time food but maharashtra government think poor people but no one show , i know bjp is world publicity stunt party but maharashtra government testing percentage and medically result limited but present time indian want stay at home but indian people think i am strong no corona virus attack my body but think american country very powerfull not very cleverly handel it .

Uddhav sir know no one change mumbai people mind uddhav thackarea  change indian political mind only show what kind change next prime minister of india is uddhav thackera jay hind
He has done very well. It is opposition and media to prove now how they are well cultured and work constructively. And it is time really for all to live deceplined and should not put all state in trouble. This is very big issue not handled by any one in many hundred years. And with this type of concentrated population no one in world might have handled this situation. God bless this state and nation and leaders normally known for fraudes now working excellent . We have to appriciate the the steps took and can’t blame them for misbehavior of people due to ignorance. But people having problems and coming out is also their limitation not able to get essentials in want of money. Many hurdles but their steps are correct and we must appriciate. If  central intelligence would have started checking earlier at all air ports we have in better situation.
This is some how unique situation and may be our CM is only correct person to handle this, this is why suddenly nature also played roll to make him CM  in very different situation  which was in our destiny after few months, he become CM. It is like God selectes correct people at correct time. They are made of different strength than others might not have thought off also. Very huge size and number of people this state had to safeguard.  God bless all people , state , country with all good , decepline, order and prosperity and save us from corona and aftermath . Every one need participate in this situation by following govt instructions.
Test Kits are provided by Central Government, by giving less, Central Government is responsible for this fiasco in Mumbai.
Huge population lives here in slums where Social Distancing not possible unlike Kerala.
Maharashtra was proactively working even before Central Government to fight COVID 19. I thinks views are biased. By the way, I had voted for BJP for India’s Growth expectations.
Baseless aligations!!
The situation was well handled by Mr.Uddhav.
Please get ur facts right!
I totally disagreed with this Heading of this news..Our CM Shri Uddhavji Thakre n his Team is working very efficiently n effectively n transparently.
If you don’t pull this personal views down. I would like to know the cyber cell that your article is creating unrest in public.
Being mumbaikar  we knows  geography  n demography of Mumbai  so very begingly  I have Twitted, to deploy Army as earliest to combat the situation ,we know the  that this newly form government, won’t do much better  coz having  egoness amongst them, but this govt if would have run by majorly by AJIT PAWAR, then situation would have different  coz  AP is prompt decisions  taker person  as well  efficient organizer n admn  dictator, this khichadi govt,bless by SP, won’t tackle pandemic covid 19 Mumbai has worst density  of scattered  slums , demographically, cunjusted, unhygienic, indiscipline  life style of slums, may coz for community transfer easily and it happenings to  if Central govt  dont take serious note to deployed Army  as earliest, then  maharashtra escape  from stage 3rd to enter,
I am from Kerala .you cannot compare Kerala with hundred percent literacy,life expctancy of 75 yrs and doctor patient ratio of one to thousand with mumbai.Mumbai has the biggest slum population and migrant labourers. Don’t bring politics when we are all fighting for survival.
Alertness and actions should have started right from January 2020
Given the density of certain areas in Mumbai, a much quicker and effective response
was required. Uddhav’s inexperience in administration and execution is evident. It’s far easier to throw muck at adversaries through Saamna; governance is a different game.
Incidents sited suggests some failures to be serious of nature and CM Talking in local language is not gd for Mumbai which is affected the most in entire nation
Never a Fan Of Shiv Sena in the past but reading to extensibility the BMC is done to report and keep updating the number of cases ward wise is remarkable. Living amidst a pandemic of such high velocity the BMC. with the help of the state police have not only helped in reassured safety but also  helped in navigating the the people to the light at the end of the dark tunnel. I am sure and confidence with the state Government at this time.
And with a pandemic happening please stay away from political agendas  instead of criticising it with be of utmost help if the central government support the states and not spread such fearmongering posts.
If numbers seem high in Mumbai, it’s because The numbers tested are the highest in India per million population. So,  closer to reality are the numbers and hence seem higher than rest of India. Please get your facts right before reporting. He has proved to an honest, down to earth and connected CM. God bless him. No manipulation of data is going on ,hence numbers appear how they do.
Didn’t know your tripe was that biased! Thought SG was giving neutral views all this while. C’mon how further you all will fall to delegitimze Maha govt. Shame!
What else can we people of Mumbai accept from the bhakt of a BJP it looks like these bhakt don’t use the brain and only bark like street dogs instead of praise him and giving him a helping hand these people are just poking they’re dirty nose and not allowing him to do his job only fit to pass comments on others, speak abt how much financial help Modi has he given to Maharashtra, to build statues he has or spents lot of money.
Talk like a sensible people and not like an uneducated.
The author is a writer and a national media panelist of the BJP. Views are personal.
#JustSaying
I think it is wrong on the part of the BJP author to critize uday Thackeray. Mumbai city is hub of india, people of Mumbai has visited foreign country’s more as compared to other cities, & more over people of daravi, who are  uncivilised, they are themselves to blame for the situation created by their pathetic behaviour. So you can’t blame udayji. Don’t play dirty politics at least at this juncture. He is doing his duty sincerely & we mumbiakar know it quiet well. Stop your biased opinion.
author needs to have his brain examined  .
We need to support to govt state as well as central. This is not time to target.
It’s blame game from one party to onother,in reality no one is sufficient enough to do anything,we do not need any leaders right now, because they are seriously incapable.They just know to rule for them themselves and not for the people. governance is out of bound for any politician India has,and  in the middle we forget where are those leaders who come to you doorstep with hand folded for requesting to vote them???India needs to shun these termites.Things will possibly change post Corona,let’s hope it does for the brighter side
How much money you got from opposition for this article? I don’t know you really knows how people are staying in these slum areas in Mumbai and Pune. When you are comparing with state like Kerala or other states. In slum area more than 4-5 people are staying in less than 100 sq.feet hut with common toilet facilities. Hardly they are getting less than 100 litres of water for each family. Easy to criticize anybody but reality is not what you written. Even central government also not doing so well but instead of criticize, we have to support government weather it is central or state. Basically all state government is fighting directly against covid-19 not central government. Central government is like a backup support.
Instead please go and help government. Auther should need to analyze all circumstances before giving such sad headline.Please analyze before you give any headlines. Its very easy to point fingers but very difficult to stand with working people and help them.  Maharashtra Government is working very hard, we all should support them. If we can’t help we should not pull the leg. This is very critical period please grow up and save our kids and parents.
Its very easy to point fingers but very difficult to stand with working people and help them.

This exposes the criminal intent of the BJP who has failed on all fronts. Modi ignored the seriousness of COVID and was dancing on the tunes of Trump. They were busy in destabilizing elected govt in MP and are now looking out to destabilize an elected govt in Maharashtra. The Bandra issue is a conspiracy of BJP to push army rule in Maharashtra. Doctors and health care professionals are getting infected by COVID as PPE and Masks which Centre has taken upon itself is not providing to non BJP states. The fact that Modi was allowing exports of PPE’s and masks upto 19th March itself exposes criminal failure of Modi Sarkar to create stock pile Inspite of the WHO inventory with itself since early February. The manner in which Modi surrendered in obeisance to Trump on his retaliatory threat and supplied Hydrochloroquine by denying the stock to Indian doctors. It’s time Modi Sarkar cooperates with states and stop low level politics. Really shameful article written by BJP panelists. It confirms the intelligence input that Centre wants to put Maharashtra under Presidents Rule
Please analyze before you give any headlines. Its very easy to point fingers but very difficult to stand with working people and help them. Auther can’t compare Mumbai with any other city, population density and international migration is very high in Mumbai. Maharashtra Government is working very hard, we all should support them.

It seems the reporter has never been to core areas of Mumbai like Dharavi, Mahim, etc. and not aware at all of the genuine difficulty there. Totally irresponsible journalism. The need of the hour is to make ‘Zero Corona Mumbai’ asap by coming together and helping in the direction of solutions.

Not a dramaractically elected govt. It is alliance of convenience. There are so many lope holes which needs to be pluged. Minsters making mistakes in this situation can not be forgiven. Like giving permission to high and mighty or langotiwalas, beating an employee at his banglow forgetting the law of the land,taking law in his own hang like thugh.
This is not the time to play blame game
Mumbai has been the gateway to maximum international flights. Mumbai airport should have been closed in February only and not during March.  Much of the problem started from there no foolproof screening was done at the airports it was too late the covid19 tsunami had already arrived. The damage has been done. Don’t expect Udhav Thackeray to do a miracle look at other states.
Such a stupid, BJP sponsored article… People like you are the main reason for the country’s failure…. No sources of the bullshit just a stupid bhakt theory…… Journalism no doubt is in India is a big joke in itself with clowns like you. That NCP incident had no shit to do with the pandemic situation, it was done by a supporting party MLA whatsoever not defending that henious act but why is that linked here?
Can this  तौहीन talk in the same  breath about the fabulous government at the centre. His paymasters continued with the parliamentary session till 23 March by which time Maharashtra and Mumbai were partially locked down in a systematic manner. The central government has almost copied the process from the Uddhavji Thackeray’s line of action in Maharashtra. Uddhavji’s government is in consistent touch with the masses in spite of the disturbances created by the learned national leader through his television appearances in between with no concrete solutions. By the way the closure of the session of parliament was delayed for two apparent reasons, one to bring down the democratically elected government in MP ; it was a slap on all ethics, and two to bring in entertainment in Rajya Sabha, I mean getting Manoranjan Gogoi elected in the upper house. This government has shown total apathy towards the imminent dangers of the spread of Corona virus. Very disgusting.

Please
It is felt necessary to carry out maximum tests in those areas by making special tasks force from bmc as well as govt  on war foot so we can to reach towards clean the prime detection of such affected persons people’s with very short period without loss of time for effective control then we may have to come at proper stage for further decision on landmark also
Brainless Gobar spokesperson of BJP,what are u going to write for Madhya Pradesh,fast charging Maharashtra  covid numbers Under Social Distancing breaker Shivraj Singh Chauhan
CM is doing great job this is first time Maharashtra got a dynamic
I didn’t read the article first.. I checked the comments 😜
Godi media is really so good in spreading hatred messages and articles not only on Delhi news channels but also in online news articles.
What else to expe t from BJP suppirter , apperently all BJP MLA in the state donated their  share to central givt includindmg governor who drwas salary from the state !share of the syate govt of gst is not paid so far !any one who knows mumbai understand that it is difficult to impose social distancing on people kocked down and living in room crowded by 10 to 15 people ! Huge migrant population which was goven no time to leave mumbai by centeal govt who declared lockdown on 22nd march
Gadkari quoted from Richard Nixon’s biography, “The man is not finished when he is defeated. But, he is finished when he quits.”. Considering the garguatin task  of largest populated metropolis and the limited resources of the state, nobody else in his place could have handled the  issue so deftly. Carry on the good work  CM Udhavji, we sincerely and whole heartedly support you.
All of this is because of Congress, ncp and shivsena politics
Please get updated about the ground reality.
The kind of efforts Maharashtra government has put into control the spread of this virus is truly commendable considering Mumbai is one of the major entry point into India, has the biggest slum in Asia, has a huge no. of migrant population compared to any state in India.
Pls don’t loose your credibility in the eye’s of the reader with such writing based on half-hearted research.
The situation would have been worse ten folds, if it wouldn’t  have been handled so efficiently by Mr. Uddhav Thakrey. He has gained our respect!!
Totally disagree with the author.
The author is a BJP man. We are reading The Print for getting updates of real facts,. We don’t want to know what this anti national is saying at the time of a national/international crisis.
Remember Mumbai and Maharashtra as such a Commercial city tens of thousands people travel in and out keeping in view of it still the government is doing consistently good job instead of making provocative statements and fighting amongst us let’s make corrections and come out with solutions.
FYI they are not ‘not’ testing high risk contacts but testing them on the 5th day to prevent false negatives. Please get your facts right before publishing such things and criticising the govt.
BJP has only hope  of coming to power  with following strategies 
1 . promises (later don’t honor) and showing big dreams
2.  Spreading hatered against some enemy (it can be real or virtual or big by exaggerating)
3. Buying MLA/MP from wining parties and toppling elected government
4. Threatening with institutions enquiry
5. Governor or Military Rule
Why so desperate for power? 
Answer: Nation Interest or
  It seems only for  serving ultra rich at the cost of poor.
Worst title. It is the complexity of Mumbai and crowded area’s which make more no of patients. No only that some people come out for morning walk aslo. Please blame those people who don’t follow the protocols. Don’t blame government rather help them.
Pathetic political article. Shame on Maharashtra BJP for playing politics at a time when PM Modi is working hard to manage the national crisis. Exemplary job done by Mumbai Police, BMC  and Govt of Maharashtra to contain viral spread in densely populated Mumbai.
Udhav thakrey was never going to be great CM running stupid coalition govt . But you cannot compare maharashtra with anyone  state . Maharastra has most migrants and with highest population density in Mumbai region , covid 19 has  cake walk to spread it’s wings . No govt could stop the spread .
I am sorry sir this is completely biased perspective we have been doing well the test rate is high even amongst all states the bjp is a party who thrives on playing politics in times of national calamity. The incident in bandra smears of a political conspiracy precisely opposition conspiracy. The CM the health ministry has been doing fantastic job in state, I concede that state home ministry is going soft on Tablighs there too the softness is political. But we have by far the best recovery ratio the curve has started to flatten. The central govt has still not given permission for plasma therapy treatment. Definitely the politics is played by center and state opposition. The person writing this should clarify has he donated to state CM fund I am sure he has not not a single bjp person from state has donated to CM fund donot they feel ashamed of it, their loyalties should be to state and people of state but to these people it’s only party that matters no state nothing. What  right he has to criticise. I am proud of my CM he tells his people what govt is doing for them. He is not asking from his people.
The PM has always shied away from giving to people his track record is he has always asked and taken from people. He and the central govt should infact be ashamed of their conduct. Whosoever this writer is his personal views are completely biased and untrue. Infact they have still not been able to digest the loss of power in state. Why are CM funds out of CSR is this not a dirty and cheap politics.
I personally condemn the allegations on our hon. CM Uddhav Thackerayji massive respect for him the way he is managing and handling the crisis. Note that Hon. CM Uddhav Thackerayji is a resident of Mumbai he knows Mumbai like no other politician. He is doing everything possible for Mumbai and Maharashtra without causing inconvenience to the residents of Maharashtra.
Efforts of PM Modi to manage COVID crisis are nullified by such BJP political writers. Shame on BJP which is playing politics with peoples life. Govt of Maharashtra, BMC and Mumbai Police have done an exemplary job in containing viral spread in densely populated Mumbai.
It’s a not truth…no all over India peoples are telling that Maharashtra govt.& CM is doing very good job….
The author is BJP person. This itself is enough to  not bother about these one sided views.
I agree with User3 comments but also agree with authors raising points like war room and etc….and sure it’s failure of central government becoz in January mr.modi invite lakhs of people in ahmedabad’s motera stadium to spread corona virus by mr.trump and mr.modi enjoying not care for COUNTRY main culprit is mr.modi  and now he project him as survivor .must bjp mukt bharat party spread hindu muslims issue and damage country ‘s social fabric.
Yes. Uddhav thackeray ji not able to right  step immediately. Like Yoginath ji .uddhavji aapka koi kargar step dekhai nahi de raha jaisa dusre rajya me ho raha .agar yahi hal raha to mumbai ka haal bahot Kharab ho jayga. Please  come out & take  nessossory action.
Maharashtra government taken good effort to resolve this uncertainty in amidst period. The public are not taken proper precaution even after given proper guideline from government. We all are educated people and need to spread awareness in society to make social distancing.
Requested to this author dont share such kinds of news Unless and until support to this Maharashtra state.
If u still agreed on your above statement then don’t have rights to stay at our Maharashtra
Regds
Jai Hind Jai Maharashtra
Good hit job…
Actually it is Union government who is responsible for this corona blunder-like
1)Unlimited entry and flights from overseas to allow all rich Indians who left India and their non insured relatives, while leaving domestic migrants rotting.
2) Repeatedly lying over capacity of testing. Like bank Cheque with no money in account but who is going to tell people that there is only capacity and we cant do those numbers of testing.
3)worst kind of communication.
Only MH is following the testing+treat+herd immunity path honestly and without any fearmongering.  THis is long haul and we dont have any vaccine.
Army has no magic beans to cure this or to stop people from moving around. This obsession with military is sign of bored, urbanised, alienated individul rich ruin-kies with no reality connect.
Just understand this- Despite voting BJP, State CMs are doing really fine job. Instead stop toppling govt during crisis and fairytales of army. Dont abuse this space you got to represent views.
This is very biased Mumbai has so much international exposure and our very own CM is doing a wonderful job it’s called a city of dreams we have so many people coming from all over India & world and I bet u Mumbai city will be the fastest to get back on its foot and lead the full country out off the corono crises and plz don’t put such articles which degrades our CM not accepted  jai bharat jai maharastra me mumbaikar
Author is another andhbhakt. Hope get well soon
The writer of this article obviously has no journalistic credentials and could not have been more wrong. HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED for letting his personal view come in to this. Instead of being a real citizen of India and reporting from both sides of the coin. In times like
This live mint actually thought it be ok to get the views of a BJP national media panelist. LIVE MINT you too should be ashamed. There is a limit to sensationalising news. At time’s like this is this the humanitarian thing to do. The sheer numbers of mumbai don’t make this an easy task. The proximity of the living conditions in mumbai make this an extremely
Difficult task which UDHAV THACKERAY has done with grace and humility.

Biased reporting justified.
First time the news of Maharashtra is coming out correctly. MH CM has failed in containing COVID19. Hope he comes out of vote bank politics and does his job what people of MH are expecting from him.
The apparently studied article does not throw light on the real problem faced by this country. The shortfalls in Public Healthcare is due to less expenditure by both central as well as state governments. 1.1%  of GDP which is amongst the least in the world. Developments in Medical fields in India are mostly due to private sector which is unaffordable for general population. Medical insurance is another capitalist tool. The future wars are going to be on such lines only. So healthcare expenditure should be treated as defense expenditure. The author seems to be ignorant on real issues.  This virus has shown that all kinds of ‘ bhaktagiri’ is of no use for people. Changing chief ministers is not the real solution but change in our attitude towards Healthcare reform is the answer. The above article is inappropriate and condemnable.
This is not time to write Biased news. Shame on you..
What else can a bjp person write about.mumbai is the most densely populated city in the country and therefore most difficult to control in case of a pandemic.still the local government has handled the situation admirably,even locking down the city before the central government.
Maharashtra CM is doing the great job. Maharashtra CM was first to take all the necessary precautions to stop the spread of Covid-19. And one should never forget that actually this spread in India is because of the decissions taken to escape the Indians from infected countries and those are the one who had brought this Covid-19 in India. And i hope everyone is aware about who has made such decissions. So stop writing such things whoever has paid you for it.
Dis is due to the influx dat exists in Mumbai. N no one wud talk about it but its true. This city is flooded n slums are only ever increasing. Its no government dat can stop such Crisis unfortunately. N its not a Maharashtrian thing. Everyone who lived here for long are quite fed up of dis influx. We need a cleaner Mumbai with people da city can handle
Is there an official war room at all with Central government to manage Covid-19? Has PM pulled up the home minister in the wake of his unending failures? Is India entirely outsourced to the State Governments? Is the PM being updated at all by the health minister? (By the way, both home and health ministries are with BKP). Moreover, how many of the  ministers have visited the states that are assigned to them as guardian ministers or have they treated the lockdown as a holiday?
politically motivated article.
This article is pure a BJP agenda to defame THACEKERY  they were busy making  government in MP nobody talks about that .this is a clear example.
Maharashtra government is doing all possible efforts.  We are proud to have such government at this stage particularly the Hon, ble CM & Health Minister.
The article seems to be biased one.
Very biased article virus activity depends it never come based on the party or religion, consider this as national calamity. If u compare based on state then can we think Central fail to do as much as kerala? I feel both central and state to fight it together.
Uddhav Thackery who has never fought an election is running the state. That itself says it all. It will get miserable day by day
Mumbai is big trouble …Not only mumbai but all big cities of maharashtra….CM rejected centres call to bring army…..Useless person thakare and his son….
Why udhav Thakre is not learning any lesson from yogiji? He must deal with anti-national, superspreaders, stone pelters on doctors, police and all service providers, with an iron fist, else situation will go out of control and then military would be required to be invited, it’s better if required he may invite forces to tackle the super  spreaders , violators and conspirators, otherwise Maharashtra will be suffering the worst effects of COVID-19.
By reading the article i understood the publicity of BJP GOVT.
First i highlights that MUMBAI is most densely populated city not in country but globally.
As compared to others state in Mumbai 6 people stay in 100 square  meter area with toilet, bathroom and kitchen in that i personally believe its very difficult for the person to stay in that area for 24/7 for 21 days lockdown……
 lockdown in Mumbai  could  be done with special rules as compare to other states because Mumbai is densely populated as compare to other states i knew this crisis is new but suggestions and survey need to  taken by Central GOVT of other states pre-lockdown…..social distancing is not possible in Mumbai culture because we have build in such a way that it would not help us if we follow also e.g is our local trains and transport system
After lockdown migrants and poor public mentality is roaming outside in search of food and they believe that its better to take lathi from police but inside they will die without food.
And this all should to be blame on current GOVT this is failure of our economy situation that we got so much time but we did not do something about migrants worker and for people in this critical situation…..and do 
This all is experiencing by me as am Mumbaikar
Yeah hai Bombay meri jaan, I am sure the author has never stepped into the complexity and the pace of Mumbai. Easy to blame and Hard to swallow is the right word for him.
Are you paid to write this article????
It is as shitty as the amount paid to you to write it.
May you evolve as human being and not disintegrate into worthless blind follower.
“WRITER IS A BJP MEDIA  PANELIST ‘ says it all
Literally one of the worst news or (fake) to be honest. It’s so clear that some one has definitely paid them to write this,As of now only 18 cases have been reported today as of the margin of 800 cases per day and the CM is working day-night to ensure the safety of everyone.
100%truth,after paying highest tax, no infrastructure or facilities for covid 19 patients,no sanitization work,bas sirf cm ke bungle ko sanitize karte raho.cm only appreciate those funding in cm care fund.cm Khush hai k Maharashtrae sabse jyada testing hue but compare population wid testing ratio.even recovery to death ratio is one of the major concern for maharashtra.worst scenario in maharashtra.every life matters but I don’t think such politician care for public.really missing Shree bala saheb thakrey.
Please dont read this news, this man is paid for this kind 0f opinion. Thackery is doing very good, we should all remember before central goverment, it was him who stopped most services in Maharashtra. On the other hand Central goverment should provide more clearity on several things but they are not doing it. All of u who are watching news, just observe one thing, all national news channels are only focusing on Things going on in Delhi and Maharashtra, Because both of these places dont have BJP.
Very Sad the writer must think that Mumbai is densely populated and it’s a toughest job to control this pandemic. We had covid-19 positives in our neighborhood and the measures that BMC had taken was very much proactive in approach. Please don’t write such bad comments of failure. Our CM Shri Uddhav Thackeray had done his best. In good times people wants to earn in Mumbai people from every State wants to come to Mumbai to earn and in bad times wants to curse Mumbai and talk about failures. I have seen in my neighborhood that people had already ran away to their native places before lockdown and are waiting to run away from Mumbai once the lockdown gets over. This is being so mean. Hope once these people leave the cases might come down
Sad to see Special authorities  favoured article.
Dear Writer,  our CM of Maharashtra Doing extremely good….  Jai Mahrashtra… 
If dare,  Why dont you write about the delay happened from Higher authorities ….. as they were busy in  Govt formation of specific State… & welcome Ceremoney of super power  county’s president 
Please Stop this dirty polotics at this grave situation…. & Help is fighting  Covid 19 War…..with CM of Maharashtra……
Jai Hind…. Jai Mahrashtra  !!!
The very title itself seems biased. Why & when the conditions of Maharashtra are started going upward , it’s after Tabligi, The HM MH wrote open letter which is neither answered by central or paid due attention to. Where as Maharashtra is the first state to declare Locdown . The chief Minister every time himself has come before the press & addressed the public. Wadhwan calamity has been tackled at first preference. Economic conditions of MH once a richest state is spoiled in last 5 years. During the first 7 days of lockdown has  gone in event management. No economic help or PPE or checking kits are made available. Now for last 48 Mumbai is under control. Where as the Opposition are indulgened in politics.That effect is seen in this article. Under assumption or presumption the charges against Tabligi are made. The CM in Maharashtra has preferred the only service paid attention is CORONA. The slum area of Dharawi is the biggest in Asia don’t underestimate the problems of Worli Koliwada. I didn’t know why you didn’t pay the same attention to MP say the worst attention paid state by either Reporters or The media or the Central.
The Print prints what it’s bosses tell them to malign the non BJP Govts. It’s a systematic misinformation spread fo ulterior motive. CM Uddhav Thackeray s handling of coronavirus crisis is lauded by all and sundries including WHO so please stop your biased propaganda.
Writer is an #@s***** and the guys who are printing personal views of a biased individual are bigger ones
Its time to put on a gag order
Godi media…
  Uddhav Thackeray doing best!
Paid article for the bhakts and by the bhakts . CM is doing the best he can and moreover he is keeping us updated with his humane conversations on FB live . 
Long Live Maharashtra !!
Politics is not important, control is more important. It is central or state Govt not the point to discus. 
Day by day increasing corona. Kindly take necessary actions.

Shekhar for the first time I feel the article has been written proper knowledge of Mumbai, Mumbai is a gateway of India , Aaw Jaw Ghar Tumhara , So much dense populous area, had a International Airport more under service than any other Airports in India. The Same is about Tabligi’s why not HM (C) criticised. Where as just presumption HM MH criticised . After Tabligi Maharashtra has gone worse to worst & Since last 48 hours, Mumbai is well under control. The economy of MH reached to worst for last 5 years. Natural disasters made it worst . What about MP?
Article title is very misleading. By my understanding, CM Thackeray is doing a good job. Comparison with Kerala should not be done as Kerala is a small state with less migrants and not a very busy airport like Mumbai. Yes there can be friction between the three parties running the government but they are doing a descent job at the moment. Maybe writer can focus on the central government and address the flaws there. Calling the army is a last resort.
I was convinced by the article…………until I read the last line – The author is a writer and a national media panelist of the BJP !!!
I wish author also take a look at neighbouring state Madhyapradesh and voice his opinion in deploying Army there.
All the points raised are valid and needs to be raised. Ppl who want to dismiss these serious shortcomings should do so by providing sufficient counter evidence. It’s a right and a  responsibility to raise concerns, be it state or centre.
A national spokesman and media panelist of BJP should not have written such a partisan and biased article.  Yes, some NCP ministers are not up to the required standards, but  Uddhav Thackeray is hardworking and sincere C.M. Why doesn’t the author write about Madhya Pradesh, where it is one man government and its commercial capital Indore is experiencing a steep rise infection cases? Mamaji, whose lust for power has induced him to accept Chief Ministership for a fourth term, looks quite incapable of handling the situation.
Dear sir, I am very depressed with the title. Are you getting paid for writing this so insensitive news. Kindly watch  and listen carefully to Dr Bang video. Central govt is not serious on the issue. Do you dare to blame central govt and write against them? They were busy in some other entertainment while covid started to spread in India. Well you have all the figures. Please do not write any foolish things, be mature. Everyone needs money but not like this.
Just check figures of maharashtra and den write gccomment,death figures are worst.no sanitization work in suburbs.testing done for symptomatic patients only.
Our chief minister is doing a wonderful job ,atleast he is looking into the problems of the citizens and finding solutions to the problems unlike the opposition who is poking trouble everywhere. This disease is completely new and even expert doctors don’t know how to handle the situation all are learning.
the disease is spreading because people are not following social distancing and the migrant labour are restless here who want to go back to their native place.
Yes i think shri Sinha has been paid for throwing mud at nice governing thackeray govt. Or its a poor effort of Chamchegiri
Correct
Completely  biased
Such people as this writer of the article do never have any other other angle of vision than to support a particular party assuming a PROPAGANDA MAN  as a God Father. No matter they are paid or unpaid, but in all the cases they always prove themselves partially blind.
And they, I strongly believe, have vowed to twist all the good things of others into negative ones citing  even a single natural and coincidental odd thing or even from the vacuum in many cases.
May the Almighty save their family members from being punished for their own detrimental views and acts particularly in such an alarming situation.
There’s no patriotism left in a person who remains partial all the times criticizing all others except any particular person or his group.
Aptly said.
Well said user 23. There is a group of online hooligans for bjp who used to write such insane articles
This writer is either a andhbhakt or antiMaharashtra. Our CM is doing wonderful job, which is not digested by BJP people specially fhadnavis. BJP is playing all dirty tricks and politics in this delicate crisis, to bring down the government. Fhadnavis and andhbhakts are real virus for maharashtra.
Good luck if you are in Mumbai! Enjoy gyaan giving if you are not.
Tell and insignify any one point the writer has exposed. Why can’t u look within and set right things which have been pointed out rather than whimpering?

Well said,this person has written everything Negative about the state government or Specially Thackeray Govt. according to Opposition  but does this  person has the Balls to write against the Centre where the PM wakes up after 10days and addresses the nation with some stupid  superstitions and how has  the PM fund  been collected and how much has the PM distributed to the states.We are with Maharashtra and our CM.
Well raised all the valid points
Both Mamta abd Thackeray have been big failures .Both need to be replaced at the eqrliest
What can the army do in these slums…I think whatever possible is being done. It’s a pandemic which many developed countries have not been able to handle.

Useless fellow, u r  that guy who he hv lots of paid fathers, u r brainless, bcz of people like u, govt can’t work properly, tera baap Trip ka swagat kar raha tha, tera baap Madhya pradesh me govt. Phir raha tha, tera bap nizamuddin ki permission de raha tha, tab tu so raha tha kya bey , badalala hai to central govt badal
Same is Our Mr. Modi (PM) will you ask him also to be replaced
Very biased. CM Maharashtra is doing best job in India. The scale and complexity of Mumbai is immense.
Biased indeed. The author should have ask his paymasters in BJP to set the house in order at Indore and Gujarat
Indore population is 28 lacs and look at the mess there. Let the author tell his masters to send army to MP and Gujarat. We Maharashtrians are competent to set our house in order. It is shameful that the author is blaming the CM of Maharashtra when BJP was sucking the blood out of MP  people
Off course doing good job. Getting people to assemble everywhere. Trying to export corona to other states in large numbers. He has no clue what is happening. Shame on you guys.  His whole stand is to export Corona from Mumbai to UP and Bihar. He considers Maharashtra as a nation not state similar to Mamta. Most Maharashrta people too consider same. We dont want that these things to be engineered to crowd instead collaborated efforts to contain pandemic. They are not supporting central government simply on directions of Congress and NCP. Height of Politics, at this stage.
Agree with you Ravi. This is a very biased article. The complexity of mumbai is at a very different level. If around 1500 people of the 2lakh Dharavi population share own washroom then how is social distancing possible even if the cops try? The effort taken by the police and the state govt cannot be junked like this.
Karma has its own ways. NCP minster, Jitendra Awhad leached a poor engineer for publicity. The minister forgot that he should have “sava bhav” and not “asur bhav”. Animals like him should be confirmed in a cage and must not be given any place in human society. No one must feel any pity for such animals.
Not correct
State Govt is working effectively
 just look at the growth in % you can see flattening of curve.
Not the right time for such write up with questionable motive
First look at the curve for maharashtra and den write review,also compare recovery to death ratio.
