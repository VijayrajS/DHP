I now speak for Pakistan army. And unlike Ghafoor, my actions speak louder than my tweets
I am Major General Babar Iftikhar. I am the one who succeeded Major General Asif Ghafoor as Pakistani military’s spokesman. I am no 16th-century Zahiruddin Muhammad Babar. But if names mean anything to you, then you must know my name stands for tiger or the ‘brave’. Apt for the current times. If Zahiruddin Babar or Babur could win the battle of Panipat then I will win Pakistanis the war against the coronavirus, if nothing else.
This is the first time I am writing to you in person. Don’t freak out. I’m wearing my face-mask and maintaining physical distance. You might think what took me so long to connect with you all, well, with my predecessor Asif Ghafoor’s stormy relationship with you, keeping quiet looked like a really good option. You all deserved the break, while I figured out what was it that I was chosen for.

When people say nothing good has come of the year 2020, it breaks my heart. Don’t they remember I came in their lives only in this mubarik year. Am I so unforgettable?
Who am I, even I don’t know. But I am nothing like the last one. I don’t use a smartphone, I don’t even have a personal Twitter account. People expect me to troll enemies of Pakistan, though that is not my job.
My style is rather traditional and subdued. I keep my cards close to my chest and I don’t believe in dying my grey hair. My keeping the greys, like Pakistan staying put on FATF’s grey-list, has converted many ‘Ghafoora’ haters into my lovers. That’s no mean achievement.
Some have called me an introvert, but that’s not so true. It will take time for you to understand that I will only blow the trumpet of my boss and not mine. I don’t believe in reaction. I am a man of action.

My first action was to announce a countrywide lockdown, when Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan was incapacitated by common sense, which as you know, isn’t that uncommon. I am Pakistan’s corona soldier.
These are unprecedented times. And unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. Why else do you think the armed forces is making hand sanitisers? It is good for business, of course, but then one has to oversee hundreds of our military’s businesses. How else you think our country is going to run?
While the scientists of the world are looking for a cure to Covid-19, our scientists are making face-masks. Only that will help us get rid of the fake ‘Made in China’ underwear masks. World has its problems, we have ours.
We have to fight an enemy named coronavirus whose ideology is unknown. This virus is way more dangerous than the killers of Jewish-American journalist Daniel Pearl, that’s why we decided to set them free. A decision that backfired. For years, no one even mentioned terrorist Omar Saeed Sheikh. I bet no one even knew he was still alive, but then suddenly the entire world woke up. Now, we Pakistanis weren’t crowned “fourth-most intelligent nation” in the world for nothing.
We continue to fight the fifth-generation hybrid warfare.

Last February, India wanted to surprise us with Balakot strikes, in return, we surprised India by celebrating the surprise they couldn’t surprise us with. That’s a lot of surprises in one lifetime. It is now a story for our future Pakistan Studies generations. Dushman ne raat ke andhere mein chhup karhum par vaar kiya, we have practiced that line since 1965. At least in 2020 dushman can WhatsApp and then attack.
27 February 2019 is a day of triumph, a day of being proud, don’t ask why. We destroyed two Indian fighter planes and caught one soldier. Initially, there were two, then there was one, and then we were left with none. The entire country celebrated with a Rahat Fateh Ali Khan concert on the first anniversary of the great bravery of Abhinandan Varthaman descending from nowhere into Pakistan. Nothing that India does will ever make us forget that and we will celebrate each year.
People have judged me for rooting for Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League, a team that loses each time in the league. So much so that fans worry that it might one day lose its name as well. I’ll still take credit on behalf of my boss for bringing cricket back in Pakistan and eliminating terrorism. Don’t doubt that ever.
As chief of public relations and a soldier against coronavirus, it is my duty to inform you that times have changed. Due to the economic crunch, we’ve had to lay off so many of our hired trolls. But that doesn’t mean that the field has been left open. Some of our trolls still work from home for we want them to stay safe. That doesn’t necessarily mean you all will be safe. I might not be watching you in person but remember #AllahDekhRahaHai.
This is part of an occasional, irreverent take on Pakistani issues by General Twitter. The real name of the authors will not be disclosed because they don’t want to be taken too seriously. Views are personal.

I am curious about the author of this article
Pakistan was, is and always will be a Pig Sty. There is nothing great about your nation. All countries export something or the other. Pakistan exports just one thing. Terrorism. Your AQ Khan even had to steal Nuclear technology. Your fake scientists couldn’t even come up with any technology. You even had to beg your new Abba, China (who are no scientist but copycats) to help you with your with their reverse engineering for your defence requirements. And you goofs talk so big, as if you found a route to Planet Jupiter. “Empty vessels sound more.”
Talking on BEST IN WORLD, HINDU SYSTEMS ????? Rather look at your faith rules which lives on inhuman shariat which does not allow its women to marry Hindu-Christians, so when they marry so, they are forced to convert for marrying a non-muzlim.  🤣 🤣 🤣
 🤣 🤣 🤣By the way,  are you following Saudis for being your ancestor to drink camel piss ????? 🤣 🤣 🤣
You better explore Islamic history before passing a comment just like an ignorant person who knows nothing and lives like a blind/deaf person!! What about those Hindu laws?! Not to disrespect, but Hindus don’t even allow their widows to marry second time. Take it as an advice, try to mind your own business or read Quran, learn Islamic laws and then say something!!!
The print
How come you allow the pakis to post anything they want but put our remarks on moderation when I am stating facts such as camel urine drinking in islam!
If you are scared you dont deserve to be in the media business! Your rights come with responsibilities and duties of stating the truth !
Show some spine!
In 1971 it was 93000 pak troops surrendering now that figure will go upto 9,30,00,000 that will be all the menfolk of present day pakistan! Rest will be your women & children! For a change we will give you a taste of your own jihadi medicine ! Oh, or is it that dead men cannot take medicines!
Anyways ” PAANCH  TUKHDA  PORKISTAN ” sounds great!
By the way check out on the camel urine ( piss) drunk by the muslims since prophet’s days on the internet! Of late it seems it contains coronavirus also as per WHO which will make the world’s  task easier to eliminate you porkis!
Pakistan is most powerful country much much better than Neighbor. Sorry India is dirty nation trash country lives on lies and cooked up media.
Pakistan side most friendly clean brave people, love the food and culture imran khan zindaabad
You hit the button , Jessica. You sure did.
And i concur in your estimation of Pakiatan.
The richness of its caches of fortitude, to draw an analogy here, is directly proportional to the syntactic cohesion and choice of wordage, as manifest themselves in your, nonpareil scholium.
Lolz, sahi mamu banaya indians ko tumney.
Hahaha .
Come to Pakistan and see how it is here! Gen Babar is a hero!! So was Gen Ghafoor. Allah o Akbar.. Haider Allah !!
Such a moron writer! And after scribbling much shit did not even take the courage to take credits! Loser!
Come to Pakistan and see how it is here! Gen Babar is a hero!! So was Gen Ghafoor. Allah o Akbar.. Haider Allah !!
Exactly! This article can only spread hate between the fans of both generals and some “jahil” people will think that it’s General Barbar’s  wording😣
U guys kept denying about Osama while he was in your backyard? Explain this, I know U can’t because U R All liars, every Muslim in Pakistan and elsewhere, U Morons.
Sorry,  no Pak Army officer
Don’t get duped. Fake. 100%. I am certain that a Pak Army officer, more so a senior one, can be so stupid to write such a senseless article.
now we hae to disinfect this site cos fillthy pakis are commenting here..yukkk….go share used underwears given by china..ha ha
ha ha..i pity on pakistanis..gau mutar gau mutar..they are writing..i just saw their prime minister begging the security council…fourth most intelligent nation..ha ha ha…but first in IT..international terrorism and begging
Hahaha i read many of indian comments i cant stop  laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You guys are obsessed with Pakistan as a Nation
The innocent pakistani’s are purposely kept in dark and wrongly motivated against India. If the pak public knows the facts and plans of pak Army/ISI , then the pak Army will not have existence.  That huge money they can utilise to eradicate poverty, for better education, development etc.  Since madrassa education onwards, the children are wrongly motivated for anti- india sentiments. So as you sow, so you reap. Producing world’s
no.1 dreaded terrorists.  This is very true that in future it will be Chinisthan. Pakis may get annoyed by this but it will be true.. It happens once you become a beggar.  See where pak cries for being a strong so called supporter for Islam, where in China- over 10 Lakh muslims are tortured and forcibly made to follow Chinese traditions /special law for muslims etc.  Here pak stays ignorant? When interviewed Imran Khan Niyaji tells to press- ” I am not aware of that”. Population of minorities in pak goes to 1.3% as compared to 1947(23%}. But in India this increased from 7% to 23% as on today. Exact fig mare exceed. Regarding 4th intelligence- that entire world knows. Pak bravery is allready proved  by  pak army in 1971 ..where 93,000/-soilders surrendered by General Niyaji.. It’s a world record so far, since- II WW. Thank  to pak army for their wotld class bravery..shown.. Therefore, I can suggest all Pakis to stay away from wasting your hard earn money and use them for the betterment of pak than utilising towards building/training/deploying of terrorists. As pak PM, and President openly announce “JIHAD” against India. By this you are ruining your future. Nothing happened nor will happen to India. Pak Barwad ho jayega very soon. Pak’s Rivalry will help India to keep moving up!!!
Wait & watch..
Such a biased site”theprint”…why you are not allowing my comment….#Endians ki payroll pe ho…???
What a poor piece, you don’t get to read such pathetic writing very often
Keep repeating all the things you have said in this article to yourself everyday as soon as you wake up and pray …
that’s all you can do….🤦‍♂️
Islamistan,
 Hindustan pray for good luck to General for his task. Islamistan should get rid following sins, 1)Islam is superior religion to all other. 2) That Pakistan is intelligent than others. 3) India is concerned about Islamistan. Islamistan is of no consequence to India, except an itch in groin Tinea Cruris which is very difficult to cure being fungal infection.4)Pakistani Islamistanese are all originally Hindustani. 5) There founder Jinnah was a originally of Bhatia community , his only genetic descendent now deceased was proud Indian and only Grandson is Proud well respected Indian business tycoon in Bombay.,6) None off you have come from Arab, they call you Hindi Muslim. 7) Even Ayotolla Khomeine family  is originally from Lucknow.
👍
Sorry to copy ur comments but that exact I was going to say 
Indian most succesful medicen decleard by their intelligent troll under Facest leader Modi regeam, the cow mutter and its shits, is best in Carona virus ,we Pakistani eat cow if indian use our mutter and shitt ,it will cure fast in Corona also get ride others virus of hate and superiority complex aginst Pakistan.

Reflects the dirty mentality of Hindus. All Indians aren’t hindus. We have lovely INDIANS around the world.
hahaha Abu, You do not have to llok at Hindu’s, Rather look at izlam lives on inhuman shariat which does not allow its women to marry Hindu-Christians, so when they marry so, they are forced to convert out of this inhuman rule for marrying a non-muzlim. 🤣  🤣 🤣
Everyone is NOT NAWAZ SHARIF…….
Pakistan is full of fools and beggars. The army thrives on taxpayers money. The taxpayers are getting nothing but this fluff message from the vampire army who keeps beating the war drums and keeps sucking blood from their own people. Here is another army general who wants to make more money. The writing skills is a reflection of his own intelligence which appears to be as same as any average student in year 9 from India
How much money print got to publish pic of 16th halala child of Babar ?
Why does this news agency keeps trying to glorify Pakistan?
India is running on cow mute drink cow mute and that’s all
Forget Hindu habbit, rather look at  izlam lives on inhuman shariat which forces its women to convert for marrying a non-muzlim.
U deserve chinese underwear ,nothing else.
Pakistan zinzabad. Pakistan made me so welcome thank you
Hooray, Chor-Daaku ka zindabad, cousin brothers.
Thou I don’t believe in authenticity of this article about Major General but I loved the comments of Indians. It’s like their asses are burning and putting comments are working as Fire extinguishers.
Pakistan zindabaad.

Print is relevant till india and pakistan are enemies….. 
Shameful anti national group

To name your self pushkin does not mean your are a pushkin or react your brain like a pushkin, pork in your blood which goes in your brain and make you feel ashamed, don’t forget Soviet era,super power now bulshit, only intelligent people able to do this,minded
First of all the major general talks of being the fourth intelligent nation! It seems he misread and skipped the word fourth most “perverted intelligent nation”
Coming to urine drinking please check your own prophets recommendation of drinking camel urine!  You can click camel urine drinking in islam/prophet times or on u tube videos of arabs drinking camel urine even today are available Sooo ignorantWhile the arabs do it even today  and are rich because they follow the peophet you  duplicates dont follow

JAI HIND 🇮🇳🕉
Keep dreaming, but remember Abhinandan
Sure, we do remember F-16 hunter by 50 year old MIG.
Right u r Mr.Kumar.😍
Your favourite leaders are suggesting to drink human urine, cow dunk, and what not. India is then permitting all except minority right. Pakistan is dull headed but India is notorious tyrant.
India has the most no of rape cases in a year
What can one say about these
Pea brains.if these Rss hindutava had another brain cell that will die of loneliness..the country that has an ex chaiy wala.as prime minister what can you say to the rest.empty vessel makes the most noise
That was a funny article. You didnt even get that? Seriously, it made me laugh reading your comments. You took so much pain writing it. 😂
Respected Brother. Google is not Quran,
If you don’t have knowledge of any relegion please don’t discuss about it.
It might hurt sentiment of people.
With due respect please stop involving relegion in everything. We should respect
Every religion. Brother please pray to God for forgiveness of all man kind. Our eyes are not still open even after seeing all this what is going around the world. We still keep fighting. Wakeup pray for forgiveness brother. All Gods are same
And we do respect all.
God bless you and your family stay safe.
May God bless all Humen Beings and give us forgiveness.
Non sense at the best 😂
Never seen such a stupid and disgusting article!
Jo garajte hain woh baraste nahi hai. Apnauh mian Mithu.
In English those who only shouts do not get into action. Self advertisement
Ha ha ha ha. Very pity… Pakistan has such nonsense on such key positions who speaks like common street man
Pagal general babar didn’t write this article. It is in Indian print
this is such a lowest and cheapest form of writing.  i actually and really feel for the writer.   poor guy had so much insecurities in his life that he has taken all his anger out here.  rough dad ; unbalanced mom ; strange siblings ; all this turned this writer into a child like personality whose brain has frozen.
Stop preaching and show some action against India otherwise shut the fuk up
No doubt Pak has won information war against India.
The man who has written this is no doubt a genius and has an IQ of 200 but look where has he wasted his talent.. come on dude get a new job or just join ISRO.. no no dont do that, but write an article so your people stop worshipping cows and drinking their urine as vaccine for the corona virus..
will talk about the toilets after that
Mohammed Awais, Dear Kafir, why Hindu would stop worship cow ???? Where it harms you ? Any reason for your foolish statement ? Rather you people stop following harming Shariat will do better for your women, who do not have to leave faith to marry a Hindu.
Indian most succesful medicen decleard by their intelligent troll under Facest leader Modi regeam, the cow mutter and its shits, is best in Carona virus ,we Pakistani eat cow if indian use our mutter and shitt ,it will cure fast in Corona also get ride others virus of hate and superiority complex aginst Pakistan.
You eat cow it’s your choice, it is not a super natural food that you alone eat. All world eat cow except hindu. So it’s not a specia.
Second. Clean your brain coz cow shit💩💩💩 enter inside your brain. 
3rd even in Islam camel 🐫urine also used for as medicine. So urine is urine , it’s came from cow or camel
The man who has written this is no doubt a genius and has an IQ of 200 but look where has he wasted his talent.. come on dude get a new job or just join ISRO.. no no dont do that, but write an article so your people stop worshipping cows and drinking their urine as vaccine for the corona virus..
will talk about the toilets after that 😁😁
Some of us rather worship cows than so.e jackass named momhamad.  I saw him at my local walmart working.  I gyess he was making some profit.  Profit moHAMad.
Since events of last 27 Feb, Endian has lost mind and peace, just conqure 8 hundread thousend  bulshit on innocense Kashmiries ,
.Not at all and chill dude, if you can properly digest the bad news of 50 year old MIG’s doings ite tea and breakfast by F-16 by Avinandan, then you will come over this mental phase dude.
4th most intelligent nation in the world? What intelligence created Bangladesh? So intelligent and yet unable to deliver Kashmir to Pak people, unable to subdue Balochistan or Pushtunistan, unable to install Taliban in Kabul, unable to revive economy, unable to be free from Chinese embrace….Very intelligent indeed.You should be number 1 really.
We too can supply you Masks made from Undear Wear… their quality would be much better than China…. You idiot’s….. truly begger
Hey@ThePrint,
In light of fairness and the good ol’ sport of comebacks, would you print/post a rebuttal to this article?
It can’t hurt to see the lighter side of things on your side of the eastern hemisphere. It would be really interesting because it’s difficult to beat the Indians in the art of snide comments, especially when you’re, you know, one-fifth the population. 
Let me know if you will. 
Time to court martial Gen. Twitter.
Rajesh
To whomsoever it may concern
We are a set of two foolish nations who keep on degrading and rubbishing each other cuz we have nothing better to do.Our kids are going to laugh at us that is,if we don’t make them like we are.Wake up and be good to each other cuz that’s what is written in books we rever….gita and koran
Sir you have a good soul.god bless you.i wish to see india and pakistan resolving kashmir issue peacefully and live like good neighbour’s in my lifetime.
Tell the General to fight poverty and terrorism in his country of intelligent people. Stop worrying about lndia and start cleaning up your own messy world. Anyplace where people are going hungry is a tragic story.
Let us presume Print is 100 percent right in article regarding pak affairs. Do you have courage to write about two known criminals of world Modi and Amit Shah as they have killed human being and their RSS racial agenda? I hope you’ll highlight their face also. If you don’t then it seems you simply Zee news broadcaster who always runs Pak bashing new. Hope sense will prevail
Modi & Shah are right people at right time backed by a billion Indians -democratically  choosen, unlike IK and his shaky govt.
well said.
Speaking about murders pakistan as a nation should not exist!
Anyway it’s only a matter of time before you become PAANCH TUKHDA PAKISTAN AND 🇮🇳🕉
As always only bakwas
Good that they acknowledge that Imran is incapacitated. Even Better is that there is Lockdown. Apart from that some offical fake news of two jets. A lot of ‘I this, I that , I, I ….’ almost stopping short of calling himself GOD’ .
But 4th i intelligent? Really? Is he pulling the nations leg? Any way! Enjoyed the article…
Sometimes I really wonder why India has yet not become a great nation, inspite of so many resources available to them. I think the best reason for that is that they are morally so weak and at times so characterless that they would go to any depth just to feed their false ego. Its sad and so shameful. I think the indians must refuse to hear such stupid articles where media is just playing with their emotions and keeping them in a state of fantasy.
India is not developing just because of Muslims. They are most unproductive like Pakistan,and other country Muslims.
They still live in 7 th century cult. Their population increased from9%to15%. That is they have added 8 crore population.
For India they became a a curse for development
LMAO IF THEY CAN GIVE MEDALS FOR WAR LOSSES, THEY SURE CAN BECOME “4TH MOST INTELLIGENT”.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS 4TH MOST INTELLIGENT ANIMAL?????
ITS PIG!!!!
😂😂😂
LEMME TELL YOU THIS. THE ONLY NEWSPAPER REPORTING THIS RATHER FALSE “ACHIEVEMENT ” IS PAKISTANI MEDIA, AND GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT?
ITS GENERAL TWITTER…😎😎
Pakistan has to get medicines from india , as 13  countries are urgently buying  , including usa , and do not depend on  china , the only friendly country.
All countries want to do business with 130 crores democratic India.
What a artical All can I say Get well soon Mr General. Stop Fake Propogandas. You guys cant compete with India if you really earned respect in the world stop terrorism  in you country instead of spending money on terrorism against India spend that money in your country to remove poverty,spend money on education  and improve your economy.
This shows the wish list of indian propaganda machinery. What a dirty mindset the idiot indians have. They keep dreaming against Pakistan.
Pakistan is the fourth most intelligent country in the world? Okay. Agreed. Tell me, which are the two countries between India and Pakistan?
Is the underwear used to made of masks were women or men. Men supposed to not to wear women underware masks as per our mullas
Carry on General
Indian lalas………….
WE DEMOLISH SUCH BABURS.
Continue to wear mask made of Chinese used underwear. That gives you the intoxication to blabber. No wonder babber blabbers
This was boring
Aoa.it is not the statement od dg Ispr
I think.
Definitely,,,writer has kept has identity hidden,,he is one of the”ghafoora haters”,,,#Endian..#Mirchi….
Fake, cowardice writer.
Pak Army and ISI is a Force of Angel.
India is winning the war against Coronavirus. India’s renowned scientists have discovered cure for the killer virus. It is available now at every corner store in India : Buy one and Get one free GAO Mootr And Gao Gobar. Well done Indians, you are a country of great intellect. Your intellectual Prime Minister highly recommends it, tried and tested by him. So go for it!
Indians do not have guts to confront us. Attacked our motherland like a Jackal in the night whereas our jets were send as Lions in the day light. Watch the result in Abhinandan. Kalbhushan Yadav is in our custody and still we are called the Terrorists by stupid Indians. Come again soon. Waiting for you cowards. By the way Taliban will also be back in the game very soon.
You depend on taliban! Remember only two indian kings have so far are the only one in the world who have defeated and subdued the afghans; maharajah ranjit Singh
and rajput king jeypaul! By the way afghan to Indonessia (including pak and bangla) have been our part and very soon pak will bite the dust  and You will not even realise!
PAANCH TUKHDA pakistan
A simply pathetic, irrelevant, utter non sense generated out of cow dung and urine. A mere reflection of the lunatic, defeated to the core nation, where engulfed in cow dung their MPs demonstrate protection from a nuclear attack.
A nation shit scared of even an innocent pigeon that flies to their territory from Pakistan.
A nation where the media is the worst of  all times and ages, in every definition of the word; still gets battered and shunted at their own home by One brave soldier of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf.  A man who makes a mockery of them all, proving them a laughing stock to the entire world, yet single handedly.
Such a poor attempt at ridiculing General Asif Ghafoor who proved to be a nightmare to the entire nation and the third largest, though equally incompetent, Army of the world.
Abhinandan is the joke of a century, and will remain a laughing stock for generations to come.
Indians ! stay home, stay safe. Abhinandan is a testimony to it.
So stop screwing around. Drink some fresh water for a change !!
Abhinandan is a joke yes as you Pakis or is it porkis could not take on even our mig 21 with your F16 which was downed by him and he did all this fully knowing that he will have to eject into pak! See the confidence !
Your own pilot of  another F16 which crashed because his pants were wet fearing entering India and he ejected in pak but you cowards seeing his wet pant killed him!
In Kargil you could not accept your own soldiers bodies, and in the latest Feb 27 th you lost 2 F 16s and both your pilots are gone!
We have our pilot Abhinandan and we have a Rafale ready for him but you have lost two pilots who as individuals are irreplaceable!
No wonder your prime minister (common senseless imran Khan who looks more like a product of gadaafi) could not weigh the life of pskistanis in the fight against corona and the army had to come to your rescue!
Well we will ensure that you are broken even before you realise into PAANCH TUKDA PORKISTAN 🇮🇳🕉️
Annnnnd nobody gives a shit. A country who cannot provide medicine cannot provide ventilators masks PPEs should not talk about intelligence and only intelligence you have is in terrorism activities and nothing else that’s why you guys start from bottom in every list.
Poor Indians…
Long live Pakistani love from UAE
MASTERPIECE!!!
Apart from the neighborhood war..this article is so damn brilliant. I mean the words, phrases, humor everything is so good. Hats off to the writer.
I don’t believe that this is fake news.
The general is a wise man
He is a fighter all his life and he is willing to fight and defeat crona spreading
Actually whole mankind is against the common enemy but alas as usual some Indians are loaded with arrogance and complex
Please practice social distancing with arrogant and angry people
He is not your Bollywood actor
He is a soldier and will respect the enemy
Unfortunately for a very long time Indian army is missing professionalism by brutally suppressing unarmed kashmiris
Let us understand that Pakistan is a peaceful country and India has also the same intentions but remember we will entertain you fully at theater of war
Well whoever burger boy has written this piece of crap sitting in his air conditioned room on a cozy chair, has tried to create humour out of nothing…. Pakistan army is one of the most professional forces in the world… We are proud to have a great force to reckon with… Enemies would dare not to mingle such force….
Try writing ur crap on politicians and beurocrats who have given u nothing in these years of independence… They are the actual reason of our downfall….
Army has done their job… It would have been better if others have done the same… Espacially we have descent writers in the country, this baggy wearing pony tail cd 70 crap….
🤣🤣🤣🤣happy Chinese shit
Not sure why the Print has so many articles on Pakistan. Is it because of the chief editor’s obsession with all things Pakistani. India has wonderful neighbors, who are greater success stories then Pakistan.  So why not write about them or do they not exist for the Print.
No doubt Pakistan Army is the best Army on the world, and we are proud of this being a Pakistani and member of ex Pakistan Airforce i would like to apprentice General Iftikhar  comments for the country and Pak Army.  Pakistan zaindabad.
Yes best army to surrender. With pants down 93000 of them!
Poor pakis no more surrendering just break up and change your uniforms into five different colors in PAANCH TUKHDA pakistan 🇮🇳🕉
Maintaining Physical Distance or Social Distance…!
Maintaining Physical Distance or Social Distance…!!
Maintaining Physical Distance or Social Distance…!!!?
Keep using Chinese malfunctioning  weapons to boast just like wearing underwear mask they gave you. And before you say anything about gau mutra or cow urine your pedo prophet told you to drink camel urine check your hadiths
Mental people, do Pakistanis really have brains, this is the reason they are wearing Chinese underwear over their nose as mask and india exporting medicine across the world
Mental people, do Pakistanis really have brains

Pakistan is always be a terrorist country in the world. First of all you katuas are good for nothing. Kashmir is always ours. You katuas are eating Chinese potty ok. In future also u will eat. China will take all the cream of your fuckin country .Jai  Hind. Pakistan ko Kabrastan bana denge as an when required. Still time is there to change ur attitudes towards any Asian countries OK. And particularly Mighty India.
sarcasm at its best.
somebody has to tell these poor pakistanis.. its not moment of proud..
while others had their last laughs reserved.
“The Print” appears to be funded by Porkistan and their sponsors
Yes from the way they moderate indian comments while allowing
Abuse by the pakis freely, it appears something is fishy by shekarji! Pakis repeat because indians dont learn!😂
But we shall prevail!🇮🇳🕉
Action speaks higher than words. Haters can hate…
How’d you like the tea? 😅
Courageous and Bold Writing.
Allah may remove boundary between Muslims country and Give us courage to become one Millat, As Kufar are one.
Kheechad me padhe kacchda prani, apne aap ko bahut intelligent bol raha hai….uske muh me pura kheechad hai…..
General Iftikhar against his predecessor that is bad form. His grey hair do not match those of Babur who was bald. Intelligence of Pakistan is reflected in asking America to bomb Pakistan near Islamabad and say hello to Osama. Abuses de reflect fourth last intelligence status. You still have a right. To live peacefully
Deserves a Nobel Prize in Literature.  Pakistan is are indeed the 4th most intelligent species on Earth . The Donkey’s come third!
A country that has zero contributions to scientific community till date, including both noble prize winners leaving the country for good. Probably Pakistan army is the only army that holds the record of world’s largest Surrender post WW2. Except for what army can do Pakistan army can do everything else.
Humourous
Entire world scared by invisible threat. No one not sure about tomorrow. Is this right time to scold each other. Sic of you all.
Let this illegitimate descendent of Babar…. bask in his bliss of ignorance…times ahead will show … for not forget to shine ur begging bowl…u gonna need it desperately…
Pakistan🇵🇰 military one of the strongest in the whole world we respect you love you… And general ghafoor is the nightmare for endia
Hum daar gaye , hahahaha.
Pakistanis have been declared world leaders in the specialised industry of forgery by none other than the British high commissioner to Pakistan, Adam Thomson. This statement came when a visa scam was unearthed in Pakistan by the British tabloid The Sun.     The News
Everyone knows who they are and what they are. Don’t spit up because it comes down to OWN face.
We are very afraid of him ohhh.
Mr India, you are still living in 80’z  open your eye and change abhinandan diapers
Not sure why India is so obssesed with Pakistan. RSS-BJP Nazis cant take care of their own millions livin in abject poverty, but busy in making false propoganda on surgical strike and balakot where they destroyed a few trees. Maybe its just an attempt by theprint.in to get into good books of Modi-Shah BJP-RSS Nazi network like India today and republic tv by spewing venom against pakistanis and muslims.
ST… in fact you belong to a nation  drinks urine, worship animals resultantly your mental health badly affected even stopped working … it is proven fact Pakistan intelligence agency recognised the best by top military powers on the other side propaganda India does against Pakistan never appreciated by the world being based on fake facts …you shall remember two Indian planes shot down by PAF  pilots   including Abi Nanden plane by our gallant pilot, arrested him live, then returned watched by world.. your brigade was on our target and gen bipan was  in bunker but our pilots deliberately dropped bombs nearby  aiming to deescalate tension, , so refrain opening your dirty mouth and never try to cross limit
🐷🐽. Bheekaristan Terroristan Kay Bheekhari go eat Chini master’s 💩.    😹😹
Bloody paki go back to your own site
You are a true Pakistani. You see what Indians drink but don’t see what Pakis eat. They eat corpses dug out from the grave!
Your country will have its epitaph very soon. You still revel the theory of “two fighters” shot down. But your Gafoora opened the account with two Indian fighter shot down and three parachutes dropping pilots. It turned out to be two in the afternoon and one in the evening. I pity your two pilots who laid down their lives and died unsung. One of them got entangled in the tail of F16 and broken into pieces. Other one reached the hospital three fourth dead, beaten by the people who you call your citizens. You can still celebrate the event. No surprises! If you can believe buraq the donkey flying to your God’s place, nobody can prevent you from swallowing what is fed to you by gaffoora…. And make a happy living hereafter!
In English those who only shouts do not get into action. Self advertisement
Ha ha ha ha. Very pity… Pakistan has such mindless man on such key positions who speaks like common street man
First of all the major general talks of being the fourth intelligent nation! It seems he misread and skipped the word fourth most “perverted intelligent nation”
Coming to urine drinking please check your own prophets recommendation of drinking camel urine!  You can click camel urine drinking in islam/prophet times or on u tube videos of arabs drinking camel urine even today are available Sooo ignorantWhile the arabs do it even today  and are rich because they follow the peophet you  duplicates dont follow
and have become a bhikari
nation😂
Coming to your army remember 93000 of your troops had surrendered with their pants down
and shamelessly continued in service along your shameless terrorist nation!
Now it’s going to be  “PAANCH TUKDA PAKISTAN” very soon!
JAI HIND 🇮🇳🕉
Funny Indians as they dont know when there assess were kicked. The article is not written by DG ISPR but Indian propaganda machine.
A Man who praises his own self is called a Donkey . Empty vessels make the most noise .It is the blood of the entire P Nation. To shout for nothing ..Even during cricket matches . One four and whole p crowd starts dancing ..And at the last ..they end up with tie tie fish 
Lol
I want to appreciate that genius writer who shed light on Pakistan and it’s General Babar Iftikhar.  No wonder why the remarkable writer of this masterpiece wants to remain anonymous because “Gems”are always hidden.  How on earth Pakistani people could imagine themselves as fourth most intelligent nation when the founders of Coronavirus vaccine and life saving drug from Atomic radiation live in their neighbours. Indian genius scientists have found solutions for these issues in “Cow Urine  and Dung” GAO MOOTR and GAO GOBAR.
For no reason Pakistan is a failed state , blacklisted with a literacy rate of below 50% and yet you claim to be the 4th most intelligent nation .
Lol… By the way to add to your empty knowledge base , son of a bitch , India is the only country in South Asia apart from China to make atomic energy converted into utilities other than  just nukes , not like Porkistan who gets those nukes in its begging bowl from China .
India has a 200 billion dollar Information and Technology industry something more than Porkistan’s GDP it self .
Indian Bafoons go drink cow urine and mind your own business, you fake news spreaders, dirty politics Players and lousy liars
Bsdi Walo..are u so dumb to understand that this article is written by an Indian. It is all sarcastic and trying to make fun of Pakistan
Look who is trolling .the people who are stuck in gau mutr.where army generals work is to dry underwear of rss
Zak,
Have you stopped licking clean mental general babar iftikhar’s used underwears and eating his shit?
India is already winning the war on Coronavirus. It has just introduced the cure after long hard research carried out by its renowned scientists. The medicine is available to purchase from any corner store in India.  It is tested by Modi and he strongly recommends it.
Go buy one and get one free.. It’s called
 Gao Mootr and Gao Gobar
Actually Pakistani’s are licking Chinese underwears
4th in Intelligent in international mental hospital
27 February 2019 is a day of triumph, a day of being proud, don’t ask why. We destroyed two Indian fighter planes and caught one soldier.
You eat cow it’s your choice, it is not a super natural food that you alone eat. All world eat cow except hindu. So it’s not a specia.
Second. Clean your brain coz cow shit💩💩💩 enter inside your brain. 
3rd even in Islam camel 🐫urine also used for as medicine. So urine is urine , it’s came from cow or camel
27 February 2019 is a day of triumph, a day of being proud, don’t ask why. We destroyed two Indian fighter planes and caught one soldier.
Your preference is Kashmir to carona.Kashmir will only be a dream.hope you win over carona
We want to solve this issue with conversation not on war, you pple dont undrestand what war is. When we fought 1948 india has called united nation to solve this with conversation bcz india got familiar with unbeatable Pak Army and unbtble trible pple
Great! With masks made of lankots and test kits bounced from all over Europe with ten to fifteen percent success rate you descendant of Babur going to win over Covid-19? Good luck!!
Read this only in the end:
part of an occasional, irreverent take on Pakistani issues by General Twitter.
😁😁😁
India media as usual spinning fake propaganda, only a few days ago 5 Indian special forces were killed by 5 freedom fighters, the so called special forces lost their special powers against ill equipped and untrained freedom fighters how pathetic is the Indian army.
