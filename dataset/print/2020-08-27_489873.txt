No salary hikes means India’s economic recovery will have to wait even if hiring resumes
New Delhi: Joblessness may be easing in India as the economy gradually reopens from the world’s biggest lockdown, but wage growth remains subdued — dashing hopes of a recovery in the consumption-driven economy.
A survey by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP showed average salaries gained 3.6% in the fiscal year that started in April, down from 8.6% a year ago. Only 23% of the companies surveyed said they planned to offer hikes next year.
Wage bills of companies increased by just 2.9% in the three months to June from a year ago — the slowest growth in 18 years, according to a separate analysis of 1,560 listed companies by Mumbai-based private research firm Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt.
“If you look at the manufacturing sector, wages declined by 7%. So that’s a deep gash,” Mahesh Vyas, managing director of CMIE, said by phone. He doesn’t see wage growth going back to pre-Covid levels in the “foreseeable future” as “the economy is facing a serious problem of contraction of income.”
CMIE estimates the jobless rate fell to 7.4% in July from a record 23.5% in April, the height of coronavirus-related curbs. Slowing wage growth risks squeezing private spending in Asia’s third-largest economy, where consumption accounts for about 60% of gross domestic product. India’s GDP will shrink 4.5% this year as a result of the pandemic, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The lockdown’s damage to the economy will be reflected in quarterly GDP data due Aug. 31. Economists in a Bloomberg survey predict a 19.5% contraction in the three months through June.
“Given the structure of labor markets, we believe that most of the pre-pandemic jobs will return, but the wage outlook is likely to be dimmer compared to the pre-pandemic world,” HSBC Holdings Plc analysts, led by Pranjul Bhandari in Mumbai, said in a report last month.
