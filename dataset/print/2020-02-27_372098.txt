Indians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan taken to ITBP quarantine facility
New Delhi: The 76 Indians and 36 foreigners, evacuated from coronavirus-affected Wuhan city of China on Thursday morning, were being taken to an ITBP facility in the national capital for quarantine, officials said.
“The evacuees will go through a thermal screening procedure at the tarmac of the airport after which they will be kept at our facility in Chhawla area for quarantine,” a spokesperson of the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) said.
An Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft brought 112 people that includes 76 Indians, 23 citizens from Bangladesh, six from China, two each from Myanmar and the Maldives and one each from South Africa, the US and Madagascar.
The military aircraft was sent to Wuhan on Wednesday and it carried 15 tonnes of medical supplies for coronavirus-affected people in China.
Earlier, India had evacuated around 650 Indians from Wuhan in two Air India flights who were kept at the ITBP facility and another quarantine facility set up by the Army in Manesar near here.
All these people later tested negative for the virus and were allowed to go home after over a fortnight of quarantine.
