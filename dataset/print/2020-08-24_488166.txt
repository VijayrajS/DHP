Positivity rate spikes to 10%, but India’s recovery rate at 75.27%, daily deaths dip to 836
New Delhi: Having touched the 10 lakh tests goal over the weekend, testing numbers dipped sharply, taking the positivity rate to its highest — 10 per cent — since 9 August. Soon after it broke into the top five high burden states club, Uttar Pradesh has also emerged as a top testing state. India’s current case fatality rate stands at 1.85 per cent.
Close to 2 lakh cases in the last three days have taken the total active cases in the country to 7,10,771. However, these comprise only 22.88 per cent of the total positive cases.
For the first time since 11 August, the number of daily deaths dipped below 850. The 836 deaths in the last 24 hours takes the total Covid toll to 57,542. The case fatality rate currently stands at 1.85 per cent.
The case fatality rates (CFR) across the country vary widely — from 3.34 per cent in Gujarat to 0.09 per cent in Dadar & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu. In seven states and UTs, the CFR is higher than the national average.
In the last 24 hours, only 6,09,917 tests were done. This takes the total tests conducted to 3,59,02,137. There are now 785 RT-PCR-based testing labs (459 government & 326 private), 617 TrueNat-based testing labs (491 government & 126 private), and 118 CBNAAT-based testing labs (34 government & 84 private).
India’s testing numbers are showing sharp fluctuations. Two days after crossing the 10 lakh mark Saturday, yet another sharp dip happened on Sunday — probably because it was a weekend — sending the positivity rate to 10 per cent. This is the highest positivity since 9 August.
With the recovery of 57,469 cases in the last 24 hours, India’s recovery rate is now 75.27 per cent. Since the beginning of the pandemic, India posted 23,38,035 recoveries. A major role in India’s substantial rate of recovering and the declining case fertility rate has been played by the ‘National e-ICU on COVID-19 Management’ exercise being done by AIIMS, New Delhi, in collaboration with the health ministry.
The total Covid-19 cases in the country have now crossed 31 lakh. The first Covid case was reported on 30 January. The current growth rate is 2.31 per cent and the doubling time is 31 days.
Maharashtra, in the last 24 hours, reported 10,441 cases and 575 deaths. At 36 days, the doubling time is more than the national average, and the state accounted for 65 per cent of all Covid deaths in the country in the last 24 hours.
Andhra Pradesh recorded 7,895 cases and 93 deaths in the last 24 hours. The total cases in the state now stand at 3,53,111. The case fatality rate is below one and the doubling time is less than the national average.
Karnataka has a total caseload of 2,77,814, of which 5,938 cases and 68 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The case fatality rate is 1.69 per cent and the doubling time is 24.5 days.
Tamil Nadu has the second highest disease burden in the country at 3,79,385 cases. In the last 24 hours, 5,975 cases and 97 deaths were reported. The doubling time is 43.3 days and the case fatality rate is 1.72 per cent.
In Uttar Pradesh, despite the massive testing numbers, 5,325 cases were reported in the last 24 hours. The total disease burden is 1,87,781. The doubling time is 25 days.
