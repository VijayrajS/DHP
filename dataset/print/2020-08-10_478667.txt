Puducherry overtakes Dadra & Nagar Haveli with top positivity rate, Goa remains testing champ
New Delhi: India’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 22 lakh mark Monday as number of reported cases rose to 2,21, 074 with 44,386 deaths and 15,35,743 recoveries, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Monday.
Daily cases continued to cross the 60,000-mark for the fourth consecutive day with 62,064 new cases on 10 August.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
