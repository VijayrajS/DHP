New Delhi:  Delhi’s COVID-19 death toll has mounted to 398 with 82 fatalities that took place in the last one month being reported on Friday, as the city’s total tally jumped to over 17,000, authorities said.
Deputy Chief Manish Sisodia and Heath Minister Satyendar Jain in a virtual joint press conference also announced that 13 of the 82 deaths took place on May 27.
“The remaining 69 deaths have taken place over a period of 34 days. These cases are being recorded now due to late reporting by various hospitals or due to incomplete submission of information,” Sisodia said.
The 69 deaths include 52 fatalities that had taken place at Safdarjung Hospital, a report for which was submitted by authorities a couple of days ago, he said.
“The Delhi Death Audit Committee had looked into all these cases and given the figures. So, this rise of 82 seen at once,” Sisodia said.
Jain said the death toll due to COVID-19 in Delhi has risen to 398.
From May 12-20, one death took place on each of the days during that span, he added.
