After first coronavirus death, govt shares list of helpline numbers for all states & UTs
New Delhi: With a 76-year-old Karnataka man confirmed as India’s first COVID-19 fatality, the government Friday released a list of official coronavirus helpline numbers for all states and union territories.
The coronavirus pandemic saw the number of recorded cases in India go up to 74, including 17 foreigners, even as the total number of cases globally crossed 1,26,420. China remains the worst affected, accounting for more than 80,000 of the cases.
The government Thursday also issued stringent travel advisory according to which India has quarantined itself, fearing the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called a “pandemic”.
The advisory states that all existing visas — except for diplomatic, official, UN/international organisations, employment, project visas — stand suspended until 15 April. This advisory will come into effect from 13 March at the port of departure.
