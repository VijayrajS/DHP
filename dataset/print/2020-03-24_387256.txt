Omar Abdullah is back, Rahul is a ‘sad’, Kapil Mishra & Amit Malviya are happy
New Delhi: In these unusual times, one has to, oddly, turn to Twitter for a taste of normalcy. Feel-good videos, sharp political jibes, the usual blame-games and name-calling continue on Twitter as if the world is not actually going through a deadly pandemic. Read on to feel right at home…
While the world goes into self-isolation, here’s one that has happily ended. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah’s first selfie after eight long months. Welcome back!
232 days after my detention today I finally left Hari Niwas. It’s a very different world today to the one that existed on 5th August 2019. pic.twitter.com/Y44MNwDlNz

He’s also making us an offer that we ought not to refuse in these coronavirus times…
On a lighter note if anyone wants tips on surviving quarantine or a lock down I have months of experience at my disposal, perhaps a blog is in order.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expresses her delight at Abdullah’s release.
So happy to learn that @omarabdullah’s unconstitutional and undemocratic detention has been revoked at last. Its about time the union government restores democratic and constitutional  rights to the people of Jammu and Kashmir as well.

Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, who resigned Friday, is not allowing his successor Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to rest on his laurels. Nath questions the haste in calling for a vote of confidence in Madhya Pradesh as India goes into lockdown.

A tweet by a health care professional gave Congress ex-President Rahul Gandhi the perfect opportunity to express himself against the Modi government.
I am feeling sad, because this was completely avoidable. We had time to prepare. We should have taken this threat much more seriously and have been much better prepared.  #CoronavirusPandemic https://t.co/dpRTCg8No9

Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram is awake to the dangers of coronavirus on the economic front — is the government?
Woke up to read the shocking news that, four days after the PM’s announcement, the promised Economic Task Force has not been set up by the government !

 And here’s BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta unhappy with Amazon. Find out why.
I know it is a misplaced priority but @amazonIN putting off book deliveries for the moment is sad. I guess I too will have to rely more and more on e-books. The longer the lockdown the more the personal adjustments we have to make. But I do fear for the publishing industry.

BJP leaders Amit Malviya and Kapil Mishra are more than pleased with the police disbanding the long-standing Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA protests.

As agencies clear Shaheen Bagh and other illegal protest sites, never forget the cycle of violence and anarchy unleashed by the ‘peaceful protestors’, which had intellectual cover from some in the media and Left intelligentsia. But finally the idea of a ‘Muslim veto’ is dead…

But journalist Saba Naqvi feels not all is lost in the cause.
Thank you ladies of #ShaheenBagh. You showed the world what women can achieve. https://t.co/Xqncz69XO1

Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle speaks for everyone who is now staying at home and needs daily provisions.
Am concerned that delivery boys of online groceries are not able to deliver. Our food supply chain can't get broken. While it is absolutely essential to be strict about people being allowed out, and I think we are doing a fine job, we need to be careful that deliveries continue

No, this is not a preview of a war-inspired movie but straight from the streets of New York.

Meanwhile US President Donald Trump is enraged by one of his favorite enemies, The New York Times.
This is the way the @nytimes finished a story on me. “You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown, and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. (not Pres.) Trump has shown….
