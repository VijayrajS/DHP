In 8 images, a guide on how coronavirus spreads
New Delhi: The coronavirus outbreak that has the world on edge hit home in India this week as two people were tested positive as far apart as Delhi and Hyderabad.
Two more cases were reportedly confirmed in Jaipur, but the patients are tourists from Italy, where nearly 1,700 people have been tested positive for the virus.
The three Kerala students who were identified as India’s first coronavirus patients a few weeks ago have since been cured.
Coronavirus has so far killed over 3,000 people around the world, with the bulk of the fatalities reported in epicentre China. Since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, thousands of cases have been detected in 58 countries, including the US, Europe, Japan, Iran, Ecuador, Qatar and Ireland.
Given its toll, it’s easy to panic about coronavirus, which first manifests in flu-like symptoms, but the medical community has outlined a series of dos and don’ts that can mitigate risk of transmission.
Singapore-based artist Wei Man Kow has encapsulated the advisories in two series of cartoons released on Instagram. Here, ThePrint republishes one of them, which seeks to explain exactly how coronavirus spreads (clue: tissue paper and masks are trustworthy allies in this fight).
