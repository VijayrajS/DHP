Temperature checks, sanitisers, social distancing — Delhi monuments welcome back visitors
New Delhi: Monuments in Delhi reopened to visitors Monday, the first time since the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March to contain the spread of Covid-19.
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had closed more than 3,400 monuments on 17 March, days before the lockdown was enforced in India.
While Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar and Safdarjung Tomb were among the monuments under ASI that opened its doors to visitors, one of Delhi’s major attractions — the Red Fort — still remained closed.
Visitors have been allowed to enter the monuments from 6 am to 6 pm. Body temperatures were recorded at the entry points and circles marked to ensure social distancing as people queued up to enter the monuments.
There were, however, only few visitors on the first day. ThePrint’s photojournalists Suraj Singh Bisht and Manisha Mondal capture some moments.
