Can get tested for Covid-19 in Mumbai without doctor’s prescription, says BMC
Mumbai: People can test themselves for coronavirus infection at designated private laboratories in Mumbai without a doctor’s prescription, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Tuesday.
The civic body also informed that those kept in institutional quarantine will be discharged only when they test negative for the virus.
Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal took the decision to allow testing without medical prescription in view of increase in the number of private laboratories and their capacity, it said in a release.
It will help people get treatment for coronavirus quicker, it added.
Earlier, a doctor’s prescription was needed for a test.
“If the test comes out positive, a (hospital) bed will be allotted through ward-level ‘War Rooms’ of the municipal corporation,” the BMC release said.
Patients in institutional isolation will not be released unless they test negative, it said.
