Rahul, Tharoor on Modi-Trump, Anurag Kashyap‚Äôs Wasseypur-style jibe, Pooja Bhatt‚Äôs cartoon
New Delhi: The Modi government partially lifted the blanket ban on the export of the drug hydroxychloroquine Monday, which is regarded as a suitable treatment for novel coronavirus. Matters were complicated by the reported ‚Äòthreat‚Äô from US President Donald Trump about possible ‚Äúretaliation‚Äù if India did not accede to his request for the medicine made two days ago. This sent Twitter into a tizzy.
Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi tries to keep everyone happy with this tweet.

Was US President Donald Trump issuing an empty threat to India for his own reasons? Retired Major Gaurav Arya certainly seems to think so.
When Modi has already agreed to do all he can, why does @realDonaldTrump threaten retaliation? OPTICS.
Getting the drug from India is not enough. To his local red neck voter base, he must look like a strongman who arm twisted India. Grow up @POTUS ü§°https://t.co/VI4hg2IRIn

Our stocks of HCQ would at best be for 1.5 lakh patients. If our patientsrise to 5 lakhs, then is it wise to export?

And then there‚Äôs Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who thought that in his years of experience in world affairs he had seen it all. But Trump proved him wrong.
Never in my decades of experience in world affairs have I heard a Head of State or Govt openly threatening another like this. What makes Indian hydroxychloroquine "our supply", Mr President? It only becomes your supply when India decides to sell it to you. @USAndIndia https://t.co/zvSPEysTNf

BJP‚Äôs National General Secretary Ram Madhav, on the other hand, is more preoccupied with how South Koreans are handling the Covid-19 crisis.
Admire d resilience of South Korean people. They saw d worst outbreak of Coronavirus a few weeks ago. But now bounced back and preparing to hold elections for 300-member national parliament on 15 April. 13-day campaign has kickstarted n campaigners r following social distance etc

And National Conference leader Omar Abdullah wants People‚Äôs Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti to be set free from detention. Mufti was shifted to her residence Tuesday but continues to remain under detention.
. @MehboobaMufti must be set free. Shifting her home while continuing to keep her detained is a cop out.

The usually jovial Sanjay Jha, Congress‚Äô national spokesperson, gets serious. Here‚Äôs his point-wise suggestion on how the government should draft the the post-lockdown plan.
Post #Lockdown could be:
1) Rank states by risk profile
2) Zone in on hotspots within each state
3) Quarantine red zones after building continuous food/medical supply protocol for them
4) Ensure 24/7 medical/retail stores for all
5) Allow offices/factories open alternate days

Author Dr. David Frawley reminds us to be mindful of our relationship with nature this World Health Day.
On this #WorldHealthDay we must consider the health of all humanity and the wellbeing of the entire planet together. We cannot live in isolation from nature or out of harmony with the cosmos and find happiness. Let us embrace the universal dharma of unity with all!

And lastly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asks British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in the ICU battling the virus, to ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù.
Hang in there, Prime Minister @BorisJohnson!  Hope to see you out of hospital and in perfect health very soon.
