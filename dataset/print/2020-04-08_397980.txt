What PM wants, who Vasundhara Raje praises & who’s mad at WHO
New Delhi: Coaching by Roger Federer, Congress challenging BJP to a contest and praise for essential services — today, Twitter had plenty of scoop. Read on!
Let’s start with the Prime Minister himself. Narendra Modi took to Twitter today to announce that he was least interested in symbolic gestures that meant to honour him. Read on to see why.
मेरे ध्यान में लाया गया है कि कुछ लोग यह मुहिम चला रहे हैं कि 5 मिनट खड़े रहकर मोदी को सम्मानित किया जाए। पहली नजर में तो यह मोदी को विवादों में घसीटने की कोई खुराफात लगती है।

श्रीमती तेजी बच्चन बड़ी हनुमान भक्त थीं। अक्सर मंगल को दिल्ली के हनुमान मंदिर में मुझे ले जाकर मेरे लिए काँच की चूड़ियाँ खरीदतीं और हनुमानजी की कथा सुनातीं। उनसे ही मैंने हनुमान चालीसा के कई छंद सीखे। आज वह नहीं रहीं मगर उनकी भक्ति का प्रतीक ह्रदय में बसा है।1/2#HanumanJayanti

BJP national vice-president and former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje shows how proud she is of the healthcare professionals on the frontline battling the Covid-19 pandemic in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara.

Talking about essential services, don’t think India Post is resting just because letters aren’t being delivered. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad highlights its invaluable contribution.

Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor continues where he left off yesterday on US President Donald Trump’s thinly veiled threat against India’s hydroxychloroquine export.
Mr President @realDonaldTrump, since India has selflessly agreed to give you the supply you seek of hydroxychloroquine, will you grant India first priority in sharing with us any #COVID19 vaccine that might be developed in US labs? @USAndIndia @USAmbIndia @PMOIndia https://t.co/M7Pze4d9CC

But his party colleague Sanjay Jha, national spokesperson Congress, has his set on issues closer to home.
This is the problem: supply chains. That makes social distancing a joke. And helps transmission possibilities of #Covid_19 . It’s a boomerang. 
We haven’t yet wrapped our head around this elementary issue. https://t.co/cSuY8eWhsv

The coronavirus pandemic is like a bad dream for all, but this might be the worst nightmare for writer Dana Schwartz.
I was throwing grapes in the air and catching them in my mouth, and then I stopped because I remembered I live alone and if I choked and died some police officer would have to call my mom and say "no it wasn't coronavirus she was trying to eat a grape"

Author Candace Owens reminds former US Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of her status in life.
Let’s be extra clear. You do not have the power to do anything. 
Still. https://t.co/YvHRezT2fY

And finally, we have US President Donald Trump back on the blame game, now WHO would have thought of that!
The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?
