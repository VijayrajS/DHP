Javed Jaaferi pokes fun at Amit Shah‚Äôs ‚Äòcoronalogy‚Äô & Trump‚Äôs corona worry about ‚ÄòMini Mike‚Äô
New Delhi:¬†Some unusual suspects came out to express their thoughts on Twitter on everything from the 2020 Super Tuesday polls¬†in the US, to the latest instances of hate speech.
Democrat¬†Joe Biden might have emerged as the big winner in the Super Tuesday results, but US President Donald Trump prefers focusing on the biggest loser.
Elizabeth ‚ÄúPocahontas‚Äù Warren, other than Mini Mike, was the loser of the night. She didn‚Äôt even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well, now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!

He also made fun of the man he calls ‚ÄòMini Mike‚Äô using the dreaded coronavirus epidemic as a way to teach him a lesson.

American political scientist Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama can neither contain his disappointment nor hide his¬†sarcasm about the results.

And here are four points by author Manu Joseph on why the Citizenship Amendment Act is a big fat mess.
The amended citizenship act is a dumb piece of legislation considering 1) its language 2) how little it achieves 3) its disproportionate damage, like loss in India's prestige 4) the BJP's global image as evil when it didn't set out to be evil in this regard.
