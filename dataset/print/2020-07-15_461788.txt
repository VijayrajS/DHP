Bihar has lowest Covid tests per million in India, Maharashtra’s positivity rate the highest
New Delhi: Starting today, ThePrint will bring you a daily tracker of the state of the Indian states on Covid-19 — a comprehensive look at how much they are testing and how fast the infection is spreading, and whether the former is keeping pace with the latter.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
‘R’ value, also known as the reproduction number, represents the number of new infections estimated to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 indicates that the outbreak of infection is slow since each infected patient will infect less than one other person. ‘Rt’ is the ‘effective’ version of the ‘R’ number, and it indicates the transmission rate of the virus in time ‘t’.
Positivity rate is the number of people that are found to be infected with the virus out of those who are being tested. This indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million are indicative of the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of that particular area.
The states and union territories have been arranged in ascending order of tests per million. All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
