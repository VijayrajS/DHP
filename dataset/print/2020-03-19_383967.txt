‘Govt order’ on Restrictive Movement viral on WhatsApp is actually from Malaysia
New Delhi: A PDF document, which looks like a press release, claims the central government has declared a Restricted Movement Order from 18 March to 31 March because of the coronavirus outbreak has gone viral on WhatsApp in India — except, it is actually from Malaysia.
On Tuesday, countries such as Malaysia and Philippines announced sweeping lockdowns after recording spikes in COVID-19 infections.
Malaysia’s National Security Council issued a Restrictive Order, saying people should adhere to social distancing, “stay at home at all times” and avoid infected local areas. On Tuesday night, the police said interstate travel is banned under the Restrictive Movement Order.
The five-page document being circulated says the restrictions on movement will be implemented by the PDRM and RELA under the Prevention of Control and Infection Diseases Regulations.

PDRM and RELA refer to the Royal Malaysia Police and The People’s Volunteer Corps, a paramilitary force in Malaysia.
Public disobedience of this order, just a day after it was announced, prompted the Malaysian Federal Government to issue another directive that said violation of the order could lead to a fine of up to RM1,000 or jail for not more than six months or both.
The document also provides a contact number — 03-8888 2010 — for further queries. This is a special hotline to Malaysia’s National Operations Administration Centre for complaints and questions regarding the movement control order. This is not to be confused with Talian Kasih, another nationwide hotline pertaining to women, family and community issues, which was recently reactivated after being suspended due to the movement control order.
