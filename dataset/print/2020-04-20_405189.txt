BCG vaccine trials to begin in 2 weeks on high-risk Covid-19 groups in Maharashtra
New Delhi: India is set to begin trials, within the next two weeks, to determine if the bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine can boost immunity in the fight against Covid-19, Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India (SII) told ThePrint.
The BCG is a vaccine for tuberculosis and is administered at birth in countries such as India, which have historically had a high prevalence of the disease.
‚ÄúWe are likely to start the study within two weeks from now to check if BCG shots reduce the severity of Covid-19 in India,‚Äù Poonawalla said. ‚ÄúThe ideal geography to start trials is Italy and the US but we are facing fund shortages there. Here, we are expecting fund release from the Indian government.‚Äù
The company is likely to start the trials in Maharashtra, particularly Pune, and it will involve at least 2,000 to 3,000 ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù people. It is set to administer a recombinant BCG vaccine to the high-risk category that includes the elderly, people with co-morbid conditions and healthcare workers.
‚ÄúThese people will be compared against the placebos,‚Äù Poonawalla said. ‚ÄúFor instance, healthcare workers will be given vaccine shots and will be checked against another set of healthcare workers working next to them but without the vaccine.‚Äù
According to a study conducted by medical researchers in the US and UK, which analysed data from 178 countries, ‚Äúcountries that do not have a BCG vaccination policy saw ten times greater incidence of and mortality from Covid-19, compared with those who do‚Äù.
Some of the worst Covid-19 affected countries such as the US and Italy don‚Äôt administer the BCG vaccine as a part of their vaccination policy.

Poonawalla said that if the tests are successful, the recombinant vaccine will be out in the market soon.
‚ÄúIf the study yields positive results, the vaccine could be in markets by the end of this year,‚Äù said Poonawalla, the son of Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla, the SII founder popularly known as the ‚Äúvaccine king‚Äù.
The SII is the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses produced and sold globally. It manufactures a variety of vaccines including for polio, diphtheria, tetanus and BCG. It is estimated that about 65 per cent of the children in the world receive at least one vaccine manufactured by the firm.

Poonawalla said that if the BCG vaccine proves its efficacy against Covid-19, it will provide a far safer alternative as it lacks side effects.
‚ÄúIt can be given to a newborn baby because it is very mild,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is safer than prescribing any anti-retrovirals or Hydroxychloroquine, which have several side-effects.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe objective of these trials is to reduce the severity of Covid-19 cases in India assuming that the vaccine will help prepare the bodies better and boost immunity to fight the coronavirus invasion,‚Äù he added.
The vaccine is not an ultimate solution but only an attempt to reduce the severity of the cases, Poonawalla said.
He added that SII has tied up with two companies in the US to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. ‚ÄúWe are also involved in manufacturing a vaccine against Covid-19. We are conducting animal trials with mice and primates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe company hopes to start clinical trials in around a month in India. By the year end, our vaccine candidate will be ready.‚Äù
On the medical trials going on around the world for new medicines, Poonawalla said there have been ‚Äúmixed results‚Äù that aren‚Äôt very promising. ‚ÄúDrugs that are showing some amount of efficacy in 10 or more days are not very promising. It is a very long period and anyone can recover by themselves or the body‚Äôs own immunity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will be substantial if any drug works on severe to mild cases within three to four days. Otherwise, until now, everything is just conjecture.‚Äù

Poonawalla said cases will surge after the lockdown but warned that multiple lockdowns are not a solution.
‚ÄúAt least 20 per cent of the Indian population (around 26 crores) will get infected with this virus in another 2-3 years but fatalities will be less than 1 per cent,‚Äù he said.
He also advocated against prolonging the lockdown.
‚ÄúLockdown was done to prepare the health system and draft strategies. It‚Äôs been done now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it should be continued post 3 May. Multiple lockdowns will cripple the economy to a point from where there will be no return.‚Äù
He further said that a healthy workforce must be allowed to go out. ‚ÄúUndoubtedly, once the lockdown will open up, the surge in cases will be noticed. But there is no need for panic,‚Äù Poonawalla said. ‚ÄúContinued lockdown is not the right response. People in India have gained immunity against H1N1 and measles by going out and exposing themselves. Lifting lockdown in a phased manner is a good idea.‚Äù

My suggestion to the whole world :
 As a stop-gap arrangement till the effective Covid-19 vaccine is found,following steps are necessary to reduce the corona infection rate and corona mortality rate.
  Start BCG vaccination. No lock down is required. Situation will become normal automatically.

Congratulations Dr. I am 64 and ready to become volunteer for the trial. I am ready to serve for the mankind.
Heartiest congratulations dr Salute and thanks for your selfless service towards our country.
 If volunteers for testing vaccine required in india i am ready. I wish to dedicate mysejf to my country  I can volunteer for the test. I am 54.
Good thought by poonamwalla sir plz  kindly put this idea before the Indian Govt to save lives of  entire world , ,
MR Poonawalas  observation is very correct. If  lockdown  extends beyond 3rd May there will be a collapse  in INDIAN  economy. It should be  phased withdrawals.  Medicines, Vaccines boosts up immunity.
 Lastly  death rate is more among 75+ age groups.  As with age their  immunity reduces. If you require I can volunteer  for the test. I am 75.
I totally agree with Mr Das, we should start this trial with immediate effect as we cannot afford anymore delay. BCG Vaccine is a ray of hopeüëç
I 100% agree with Mr. K K D .  That the Case Surge in Non BCG compliant countries is 10 times to what is there in India (as per medical researchers in US & UK) and the B.C.G  vaccine doesn‚Äôt have any side effects,  ICMR should evaluate this option as it is widely available in our country & moreover it is in Immunization Scheme as well since last 40 ‚Äì 50 years.
Dear Media Personnel, pls. try to put the views of Adar Sir through important forums so that the Govt. Of India take cognizance of it and the heads start rolling.
