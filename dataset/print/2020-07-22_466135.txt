Kerala’s infection rate improves but is still above 1, Telangana’s tests per million climb
New Delhi: India, which has the third highest number of coronavirus infections in the world, reported 37,724 new cases and 648 deaths in the 24 hours ending 9 am Wednesday, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, here’s a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
