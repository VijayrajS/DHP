The governmentâ€™s assurance came amid reports that medical staff and health workers tackling coronavirus cases were ill-equipped to handle the pandemic and didnâ€™t have enough PPE to tend to the patients without exposing themselves to infection risk.
In his address to the nation on 24 March, PM Narendra Modi said the central government would provide doctors with enough PPE to ensure their safety. The Health Ministry announced Monday that two domestic manufacturers were producing 50,000 N95 masks daily, adding that the number would double within a week.Â

Over the next week, it added, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) would also start manufacturing approximately 20,000 N99 masks every day to address any shortage.Â 
According to a LiveMint report dated 28 March, an analysis by Johns Hopkins University, the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, a health research institute, and Princeton University, had suggested that the demand for ventilators in India could rise to 10 lakh by July, against a current availability of 30,000-50,000 ventilators.Â 
The ministry announced that a healthcare company in Noida â€” Agva Healthcare â€” had been given an order to manufacture 10,000 ventilators within a month.Â
