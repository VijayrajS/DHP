The reaction came soon after the Centre and state governments have decided to completely lock down 75 districts across the country where coronavirus cases have been reported.
“Each state has pledged that they will earmark hospitals exclusively to treat COVID-19 patients,” Bhargava said. “For example, in Delhi, AIIMS’ division of National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar (Haryana) — which has around 800 beds — would be used only to treat COVID-19 patients.”
Bhargava stated that 60 private labs had registered so far to conduct coronavirus tests.
Five people have died in India as yet due to the deadly COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The government has given an order to procure 1,200 new ventilators, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said.
