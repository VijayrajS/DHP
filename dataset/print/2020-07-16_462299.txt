32,695 new cases, 606 deaths, 3,26,826 tests — 3 highest single-day jumps in Covid figures
New Delhi: In the last 24 hours, India tested highest number of samples in a single day, recorded the highest daily surge and also saw the highest single-day Covid casualties. This, even as vast disparities exist in the states’ response and outcomes.
The mortality rate varies widely, as does the caseload. The positivity rate now stands at 10 despite the increase in testing — a number that will worry policymakers, even as official communication continues to track the pandemic by recoveries, not new cases.
Starting today, ThePrint’s Covid tracker will profile the top five states instead of the top four by caseload.

The number of deaths once again touched a daily high — 606 — even as experts say it is now time to focus on reducing this number and the mortality rate rather than counting the cases. Among those who died, 43% were without comorbidities.

The mortality rates across states and UTs show how widely varying the response has been to the virus. The rate varies from 0.09% in Ladakh to 4.57% in Gujarat.

Active cases represent the actual present Covid caseload in the country. That figure stands at 3,31,146, after 32,695 fresh cases were reported in the last 24 hours. These contribute to a little more than a third (34.18%) of total cases detected so far.

The last 24 hours saw 3,26,826 samples being tested across India. This includes both molecular tests such as RT-PCR, TrueNAT and CBNAAT, and also rapid antigen tests. Bulk of the latter, though, are still being done in Delhi. The testing lab network in the country is further strengthened with 1,234 labs — 874 in the government sector and 360 in private. These include 635 RT-PCR-based testing labs (392 government and 243 private), 499 TrueNat labs (447 government and 52 private) and 100 CBNAAT labs (100 government and 35 private).

Even though the country tested the most in the last 24 hours, the day’s positivity rate stood at 10%. The number, which indicates a mismatch between testing and the spread of the disease, has been rising steadily.

A total of 20,783 people cured of Covid in the last 24 hours has taken the total number of recovered cases to 6,12,814. The gap between recovered patients and active Covid-19 cases has further increased to 2,81,668.

The total Covid cases in the country currently stand at 9,68,876. The time taken to reach the next lakh has been constantly reducing. The million mark could just be a day or two away at this rate.

Maharashtra’s total caseload continues to look daunting — 2,75,640, even though close to half of these are recovered cases. The state has seen a total of 10,928 deaths.

Tamil Nadu reported 4,496 cases in the last 24 hours and 68 deaths. It is among the ten states that account for 86% of the country’s total caseload.

Delhi currently ranks third in the country. There are 659 containment zones in the city. And as the daily positives reduce, the city has over 18,000 vacant beds, of which more than 11,000 in dedicated Covid hospitals.

Karnataka had been doing relatively well before it slipped and landed among the four worst Covid states. The state saw 87 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the toll up to 928.

Gujarat has been replaced by Karnataka in the top four states with most Covid cases. But it remains a worrisome place thanks to its high mortality rate — the highest in the country. It also has the fifth highest disease burden in the country.

This testing graph tells the story of the wide disparities in testing between the top five states in terms of caseload. Delhi and Karnataka are testing similar numbers, which means Delhi is testing far more per million population that this southern state. Gujarat did less then 9,500 tests.
