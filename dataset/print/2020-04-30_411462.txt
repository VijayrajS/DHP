Can‚Äôt lock down Delhi‚Äôs speed devils, police issue 4.5 lakh speeding challans in lockdown
New Delhi: The Delhi Traffic Police has in the past month issued 4,54,438 challans for speeding, amounting to approximately Rs 90 crore, but many of the alleged offenders claim it couldn‚Äôt have been them since they haven‚Äôt stepped out of their homes due to the Covid-19 lockdown.
According to a senior traffic police officer, motorists have been speeding, given that the roads have remained relatively empty during the lockdown. This has often led to accidents.
‚ÄúPeople are overspeeding because the roads are empty with very little traffic. The speed guns that are installed on roads make a note when any vehicle runs above the permissible speed limit and a challan is automatically generated,‚Äù the officer said.
Traffic Police said that each challan comes with a picture of the vehicle speeding, clicked by cameras installed on stretches and intersections.
‚ÄúIf there is a picture of the vehicle clicked by the camera on the spot, then that is a valid proof stating that the driver did violate the rules,‚Äù the officer said. ‚ÄúThese are all electronic challans that are machine based. It is not that personnel is issuing these challans,‚Äù the officer added.

Many also complained that they could not open the clip attached with the challan, which serves as the proof of their misdemeanour.
‚ÄúSir I also got this, but image is not opening, can u provide the image for violation proof,‚Äù read a tweet by Dheeraj Pawar addressed to the traffic police.
Kindly mail your grievance in detail at  info@delhitrafficpolice.nic.in in this regard.

Speaking to ThePrint on the condition of anonymity, a cab driver said he was issued 125 challans, amounting to Rs 3.5 lakh in total, within a month of the lockdown. He also claimed that many of speeding tickets came with attachments that did not open.
‚ÄúI may have sped in a few places. But after the first two challans, I became very cautious about the same. I do not understand how I got 125 such challans. It is impossible,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúIn many challans, the clip in which the vehicle‚Äôs picture is shown, is not opening. I wonder, if I am unable to prove my innocence ‚Ä¶ how will I ever afford to pay Rs 3.5 lakhs as challan money?‚Äù he said.
While people posted their grievances on Twitter and tagged the Delhi Traffic Police, the police responded by asking them to email them in detail at info@delhitrafficpolice.nic.in.
Several complained that there was no response from the police yet, despite shooting several emails.
‚ÄúThese are all machine-based challans and are a matter of record. In case there is any specific issue, we are happy to check our records and resolve those. We will be taking care of all specific complaints,‚Äù the police officer said.

Manish Saini said he found it ‚Äúshocking‚Äù when he received the challan though his vehicle was ‚Äústanding at home‚Äù.

Have you done any follow up story on this to figure out how are these issues going to be resolved? I am also surprised to receive challan for overspeeding, I didn‚Äôt even receive any message about it and worst part now i can‚Äôt even pay it online to get rid of it. They are asking people to come to the Police Headquarters at Pusa road Delhi, for what? I understand that it‚Äôs considered as the most corrupt profession and they might have not made huge sum of money due to lockdown but is this the way to trouble people?
All challans are wrong I have checked last month I have no offense now it is showing I have done over speeding in Nov 2019 and got 3 new challans.
How this is possible?? I don‚Äôt know how a common people can survive in this hard times and the harassment done by the traffic police and Delhi government.
unnecessary Challans are issued for my car as well. Delhi govt. is using unethical way to recover the money from public because of loss in lockdown.

Help Pl.
I have got 22 challans of overspeeding. These are fake challans.i drive car at a speed of 50 km/h .speed cameras are not correct.violation proof does not open.please remove all challans Delhi police..
Also, if we get a echallan with a photo proof. It is written there 71km/hr. How we can trust that info.
It happened pend to me as well, to commute to my hospital i am using my spouce car‚Ä¶. Very surprising, its not welcome. A covid worker us working and commuting under how much stress is beyond imagination. Such minor mistakes overspending a bit say upto 10km per hour or stoping a bit beyond stop line especially when most of red lights are in blinking mode after finding a surprise red light, is very common. Traffic police and ministry responsible shall understand and cancell all such challans during this period. Otherwise respect showcased to covid frontline workers is‚Ä¶.what one can imagine.
This will discourage people who are doing great job during this pandemic
We all should gather to resolve this problem. They even have challaned at a speed of 47kmph. Now how slower are you supposed to go in a car? It‚Äôs a commercial car that I am talking about. If the driver does not even drive at the speed of 50-60 kmph the customer sitting in the car would yell at the driver and definitely give him a bad rating which will further prove in loss to the driver as the cab companies stop giving you rides if your rating is bad. The car is already fitted with a speed limiter (80kmph) which is indeed a genuine speed in a car. The concerned authorities should understand that the speed of 50-60 kmph is nothing. Only the people driving above 80 kmph should be challaned. They have issued numerous challans and 2000 is required for reach challan. How would a driver earning Rs.800-1000 would pay such an amount after paying the car‚Äôs emi‚Äôs and other expenses? If these kind of rules are made drivers would be left with no option. If they drive slow, they get bad ratings and no business and if they drive at a normal speed then they get a challan. So what should a driver do? Leave the profession and look for something else?
Sir we are the essential Services people doing duty in such hard times may be exempted during lock down for their services rendered to the nation during such hard  times
#Delhi police employees #putting life on risk #carona warriors # salary cut #No DTC transport# more then 30 chalan #worth 60k # some technical problems in camera .
This is how we will appreciate carona warriors
