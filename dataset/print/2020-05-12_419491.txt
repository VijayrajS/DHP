Surat, a textile hub, has switched from designers clothes to ‘designer’ masks
Surat: Looms across Surat are grinding back to life as the textile industry resumes work during the lockdown.
The industry, which generates approximately Rs 80,000 crore, is the second-largest income generator in Surat.
It’s not business as usual given the restrictions, and the constant shadow of rising infections in the state and country.
Gujarat currently has the second highest number of cases and Covid-19 deaths in India, after Maharashtra.
Many individual manufacturers have adapted to the change in demand, and switched to making products that are the need of the hour. One such unit is Suneja Fashion Fabrics and Lifestyles, owned by Mukesh Suneja.
