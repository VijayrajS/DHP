India’s positivity rate decreases but infection rate stays steady at 1.17
New Delhi: There were 47,703 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 654 deaths reported in India in the past 24 hours ending 9 am Tuesday, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said.
With this, India is nearing the 15-lakh mark of total cases reported in the country while daily cases continue to cross 45,000 for the sixth consecutive day.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
