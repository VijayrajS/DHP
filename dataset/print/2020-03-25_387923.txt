Ration items to ‚Äòcare kits‚Äô ‚Äî Zomato, NGOs, crowdfunders come to the aid of daily wagers
New Delhi: In the wake of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, concerns have been raised about daily-wage earners getting robbed of their incomes due to a sudden lack of work.
While shops providing essential items like groceries have been allowed to remain open, the daily incomes of street hawkers, rickshaw pullers and laborers are likely to dry up.
ThePrint brings you a list of organisations that are raising funds to donate food and relief material for daily-wage earners.

Restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up Zomato has launched a ‚Äòfeed the daily wager‚Äô campaign which includes donating ration kits worth Rs 500, containing wheat flour or rice, two types of pulses and a bar of soap required for a family of five for one whole week.
The start-up is aiming to raise Rs 25 crore to deliver these kits across 26 cities of the country.
Zomato has partnered with Grofers, an online grocery service provider, to organise these kits. It has also collaborated with local NGOs to help with the donation.
