Posting photos of social help amid Covid-19 a criminal offence in Maharashtra’s Latur
Aurangabad: Philanthropy with self-promotion on social media in the time of the coronvirus outbreak is now a criminal offence in Maharashtra’s Latur district to prevent the violation of social distancing norms, collector G Sreekanth has said.
In a letter issued on Saturday, the collector stated that some donors are found clicking photos of distribution of food and other items to the needy and are uploading them on social media.
“This could hurt the self respect of the poor and the needy. Moreover, the social distancing rule is also not followed during distribution of food to the needy, which is defeating the very objective of the coronavirus lockdown,” it stated.
In the event of violation of the order preventing uploading of photos on social media, action will be initiated against violators under section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as provided under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, it stated.
