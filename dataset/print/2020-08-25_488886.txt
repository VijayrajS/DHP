Maharashtra’s positivity rate increases to 19.39%, MP conducts least tests per million
New Delhi: With 7,04,348 active cases, a total of 31,67,323 Covid-19 cases have been reported in India so far. According to data by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 58,390 people have died and 24,04,585 have recovered.
In ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
