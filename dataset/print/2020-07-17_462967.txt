Kerala sees increase in Covid positivity rate, Delhi’s tests per million climbs
New Delhi: In its daily state tracker, ThePrint traces the progress of Indian states and union territories in terms of their testing capabilities. We analyse how much states are testing, the rate at which the infection is spreading and the number of tests being conducted.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus out of those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
