Smriti Irani picks up ‚Äòsui-dhaaga‚Äô to teach how to make masks, after govt advises its use
New Delhi: Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani took to Twitter Thursday to share how one can make a reusable face mask at home using a clean cloth, needle and thread.
Irani‚Äôs tweet came after governments of several states made it compulsory for people to wear face masks when stepping outdoors to curb the spread of coronavirus. An advisory was also issued by the health ministry last week recommending home-made masks for the public at large.
The number of coronavirus cases neared 6,000 in India Friday, with Thursday seeing the largest jump in Covid-19 cases.
In her photo tutorial, Irani shows how to make a mask to protect oneself from Covid-19 in four simple steps. She says in her tweet: ‚ÄúUsing just a needle and thread, people can make a reusable mask sitting at home.‚Äù
