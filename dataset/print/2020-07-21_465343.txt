Manipur records India’s lowest positivity rate at 2.31%, Goa conducts most tests per million
New Delhi: India reported 37,148 cases and 587 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of coronavirus infections to 11,55,191. Of these, 28,084 were fatalities, 4,02,529 were active cases and 7,24,578 were the number of people who recovered from the disease so far, according to the data released by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Tuesday.
ThePrint team looks at the testing rate across various states and union territories through its daily State Tracker. This includes studying the number of tests being conducted and the rate at which the infection is spreading.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
