IndiGo to deep clean aircrafts frequently, temporarily suspend meals post lockdown
New Delhi: Once the coronavirus lockdown is over in India and commercial passenger flights are permitted again, IndiGo will deep clean its aircraft more frequently, stop in-flight meal service for a brief period and will fill the maximum 50 per cent seats in airport buses, airline’s CEO Ronojoy Dutta said on Friday.
“In situations like these, companies do not manage to growth or profitability but to liquidity. That means our singular focus is on cash flow. We are examining all our fixed costs and looking for ways to minimize them,” he said.
Dutta said IndiGo’s plan post lockdown will be going forward to first start the services and gradually ramp up the capacity.
“We have always been very safety conscious and now we must be health conscious as well. With this in mind, we are looking at changing many of our operating procedures. The new set of procedures have not been finalized yet.
“But we will deep clean our aircraft more frequently, we will be discontinue meal service for a brief period and we will run our coaches at a maximum load of 50% capacity. We will be coming out with the new set of operating procedures very soon,” ,” Dutta said in an email to employees on Friday, which has been accessed by PTI.
