768 deaths but 2.23% fatality rate is lowest since April. Positivity crosses 10% mark again
New Delhi: Shorn of the high numbers of the last two days — powered mostly by special testing camps organised in Uttar Pradesh — India’s testing numbers came down sharply Wednesday, pushing positivity rate past 10% once again. The deaths too have gone up even though the government bulletin says the fatality rate is the lowest since April.
The new case numbers continue to be within the touching distance of 50,000 and the transmission rate too has remained constant.

The effective reproduction number is a measure of how fast the disease is spreading. It estimates the number of people each Covid patient is likely to infect. It is constant at 1.17.

After two days when the fatalities dipped marginally, the numbers are now up again. In the last 24 hours, 768 people died of Covid. The case fatality rate stands at 2.23% today, and it’s lowest since 1st April 2020.
