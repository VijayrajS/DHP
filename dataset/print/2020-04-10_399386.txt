‘Red, hot, spicy thing to do’: Airlines connect on social media as planes stay grounded
New Delhi: As India entered its 17th day of the three-week lockdown Thursday, private Indian airlines engaged in a witty exchange on Twitter and imposed upon the need to stay home by asking each other to “stay parked, stay safe”.
The playful banter started when IndiGo poked fun at fellow airline Air Vistara asking “not flying higher these days we heard?” with the hashtag #StayingParkedStayingSafe.
Hey @airvistara , not #flyinghigher these days we heard? #StayingParkedStayingSafe #LetsIndiGo

To this, Air Vistara, whose tagline is ‘you fly higher’, responded by saying: “No IndiGo, these days being on-ground is a wonderful thing. Flying would not be the ‘smart’ choice, what say @goairlinesindia? #StayingParkedStayingSafeGo”.
No 😌 @IndiGo6E, these days being on-ground is a wonderful thing. Flying would not be the ‘smart’ choice, what say @goairlinesindia? #StayingParkedStayingSafe

Agreeing with Air Vistara, Go Air replied saying: “Staying home is the safe feeling. We can hardly wait till everyone takes to the skies, coz at the moment it’s not like now everyone can fly”, and brought Air Asia into the conversation as well.
Totally, @airvistara! Staying home is the safe feeling! We can hardly wait till everyone takes to the skies, coz at the moment it's not like #NowEveryoneCanFly right, @AirAsiaIndian? #StayingParkedStayingSafe

The thread continued with Air Asia insisting that staying home was the “red, hot spicy thing” to do and tagged SpiceJet.
Absolutely @goairlinesindia, for now though, staying at home is the Red. Hot. Spicy thing to do! Isn't that right @flyspicejet?! #StayingParkedStayingSafe

With no other airline to bring into the conversation, SpiceJet then tagged the Delhi Airport’s Twitter handle, saying: “Been a while since this bird flew out of her cage. But we’re happy creating a safer tomorrow, today! Right Delhi Airport?”
Agree with you @IndiGo6E @airvistara @goairlinesindia @AirAsiaIndian @flyspicejet, the Indian skies will be coloured with you soon but for now thanks for giving us a reason to smile! Together in the skies, and together on ground too! #WorkFromHub #StayingParkedStayingSafe

Rounding up the conversation, Delhi Airport commented saying: “The Indian skies will be coloured with you soon but for now thanks for giving us a reason to smile! Together in the skies, and together on ground too!”
