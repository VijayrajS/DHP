Covid forced them out of cities, now the Bramhaputra is forcing them to move homes in Assam
Dhubri: Lakhs of migrants were left in the lurch, with no jobs or incomes when lockdown was imposed end of March with a just a few hours of warning.
Since then, more than 2.85 lakh people, significantly migrant workers, returned to Assam from across India until 27 June, and this figure does not include those returning from other northeastern states.
During this time, more tragedy struck the state when heavy rains flooded the region, inundating crop lands.Â Families of several of these migrants now live in makeshift tin houses in the floodplains around the Brahmaputra river, known as char areas.
