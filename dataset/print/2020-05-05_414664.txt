But in these countries, 58 per cent and 53 per cent of the respondents, respectively, said they were in favour of reopening the economy while 51 per cent of the respondents in India (which has reported more than 42,000 cases and 1,568 deaths) said they were in favour of reopening the economy and businesses.

The country has reported more than 1.4 lakh cases of the virus, and 1,356 deaths due to it.
The survey was conducted between 16 and 19 April and included more than 28,000 respondents in 14 countries: India, China, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, US, Brazil, Spain and Mexico.
The question asked was, “Should the economy and businesses resume even if the virus is not fully contained?”
Respondents in eight out of the 14 countries said no. This sentiment was highest in the UK and Canada (70 per cent). The UK has been badly affected by the virus, with almost 2 lakh cases reported so far, and almost 29,000 deaths.The numbers stood at 59 per cent in the US (which has reported more than 1.2 million cases, the highest number in the world, and close to 70,000 deaths), 65 per cent in Mexico and 61 per cent in both Spain and Australia.
