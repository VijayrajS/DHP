Andhra Pradesh records among highest positivity rates in India, UP & Bengal see a dip
New Delhi: India recorded the highest single-day spike of novel coronavirus cases Thursday, as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported 52,123 new cases with 775 deaths in the last 24 hours. With this India is nearing the 16-lakh mark, just a day after it crossed the 15-lakh mark.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
