Karnataka’s positivity rate dips to 14.92%, Jharkhand & Bihar conduct fewest tests
States Tracker — a daily comprehensive look at how much each state is testing for Covid-19, and how fast and widely the infection is spreading.
New Delhi: India crossed the 24-lakh mark in coronavirus cases Friday with 24,61,190 cases, 48,040 deaths and 17,51,555 recoveries according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. India crossed the 24-lakh mark just two days after it crossed the 23-lakh mark on Wednesday. India also recorded the highest single-day spike in daily cases with 66,553 new cases Friday.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
