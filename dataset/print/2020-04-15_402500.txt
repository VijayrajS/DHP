Does your district fall under the red, white or green zone? See the full list to find out
New Delhi: The Modi government has identified 170 districts in the country as Covid-19 hotspots classifying them under the Red Zone.
The colour code also includes White Zone (non-hotspots) and Green Zone (not affected by Covid-19 at all). There are 207 districts under White Zone and 353 districts under the Green Zone.
Going by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement Monday, this means that 353 districts could see restrictions being lifted after 20 April if they continue to record no cases.
Among the hotspots are several prominent cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Srinagar, Nagpur, Pune, Indore, among others.
Here is the government’s containment plan that explains what these zones are, what measures will be in place, and what the other focus areas will be. It also includes the full list of districts that have been classified under the Red, White and Green Zones.
