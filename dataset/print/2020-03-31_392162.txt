Virat Kohli, Karan Johar, Deepika Padukone: Quirky things celebs are up to during lockdown
New Delhi: Videos of celebs doing home workouts, cooking tutorials and household  chores are passé. With theatres shut and shooting schedules indefinitely delayed, celebrities are coming up with quirky home content to keep fans entertained.
The quarantine has seen an explosion of such videos on social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. In case you missed them, here’s a quick roundup.
Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli, who sparked the beard and close-crop hairstyle trend among men, turned to wife Anushka Sharma for a trim.
The actor-producer posted a video of her giving Kohli a haircut using a pair of kitchen scissors in what appears to be a bathroom. Not quite the fancy salon setting celebrities would typically go for.
“This is what quarantine does to you … You allow things like this to happen,” Kohli said in the video.
Sharma garnered quite a few praises for her skills, while actor Arjun Kapoor remarked celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim’s job was in danger. Hakim has styled Kohli’s hairdo on several occasions.

 
 Meanwhile, in quarantine.. 💇🏻‍♂💁🏻‍♀

If you’ve got nowhere to go and more than enough time on your hands, what do you do? The Kapoor and Arora sisters decided to do a sleeping challenge together. Friends and actors Kareena Kapoor Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Malaika Arora and Amrita Arora had videos of them taking a nap made into a collage and posted it to Instagram. “Friends that nap together, stay forever,” was their take on it. Make up artist Mallika Bhat also features in the collage.

As India opener, cricketer Shikhar Dhawan is nifty with the bat. So ‘Gabbar’, as he is known to teammates, decided to try and acquire more skills with the ball.
In a video posted on Instagram, Dhawan showed off his new juggling trick. However, he opted for tennis balls instead of the more hardy cricket ball. Safety first, indeed.
Dhawan appears to be undertaking a 21-day challenge to learn something new. So, we might yet see some more skills on display.
In another post, the cricketer can be seen sparring with his son Zoravar.

If you’re cooped up at home with children, it can’t be easy keeping them engaged during the quarantine. But if you’re director-producer (and occasional actor) Karan Johar, then there’s always a quick fire round to keep the kids on their toes.
In a video on Instagram, Karan can be seen interviewing his young twins Yash and Roohi, asking them about their day and the Covid-19 pandemic.
There’s a reference to the cartoon character Peppa Pig and someone called George. Perhaps, there will be more episodes of this talk show.

 
 Need to start making them more aware of the current circumstance! Much more than @officialpeppa and George!

Comedian and popular talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is usually always up to something. Whether it’s pranking friends, guests or staff of the show, or coming up with new games for audience. However, in lockdown, Ellen has toned it down quite a bit with a new project — building the Great Wall of China and Eiffel Tower, with Lego.

Deepika Padukone has turned each day into an episode of her life in lockdown. Taking to her Instagram page, the actor has been posting a photo daily to show what she’s up to.
One day was about deciding ‘travel plans’ — choosing between the balcony, bedroom, living room, kitchen, etc., of the house — another was figuring out what to cook (don’t we all know that one), while another ‘episode’ was all about chocolate.
One of her ‘episodes’, though, was cancelled after actor Katrina Kaif seemingly stole her idea.
