Dadra & Nagar Haveli positivity rate shoots up to India’s highest, Delhi infection rate dips
New Delhi: India’s Covid-19 cases tally crossed the 20 lakh-mark Friday with the highest single-day spike of 62,538 cases, said the health ministry.
The numbers rose to 20,27,075, which included 6,07,384 active cases, 13,78,106 cured/discharged/migrated cases and 41,585 deaths, according to the ministry.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
