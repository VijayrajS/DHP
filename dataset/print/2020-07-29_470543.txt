Delhi now has lowest Rt value, Maharashtra positivity rate still highest, but sees slight dip
New Delhi: India crossed the 15-lakh mark Wednesday as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported 48,513 new cases of the novel coronavirus with 768 deaths in the last 24 hours.
Only two days ago, India had crossed the 14-lakh mark. With this, daily cases in India continued to cross 45,000 daily cases.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
