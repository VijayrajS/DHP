New Delhi: Chairman of Vedanta Resources Ltd Anil Agarwal pledged to commit Rs 100 crore for the fight against the novel coronavirus Sunday, that has infected 339,000 people and killed more than 14,700 globally. 
Seventy five cities in India have imposed a lockdown until 31 March to contain the spread of the virus where only essential services will be operational in some districts. So far, seven deaths have been reported in the country due to coronavirus, while 415 have been infected.
“#DeshKiZarooratonKeLiye is a pledge that we undertook and this is the time when our country needs us the most,” said Agarwal in a tweet that was accompanied by a picture of him banging a pan during ‘Janata Curfew’ Sunday. “Many people are facing uncertainty & I’m specially concerned about the daily wage earners, we will do our bit to help.”
The tweet has got 14,800 retweets and 59,400 likes so far with comments praising the business tycoon for his “benevolent move”.
According to The Times of India, the Rs 100-crore fund is part of Vedanta Resources’ endeavour to team up with the Government of India in combating the pandemic. The fund will cater to three specific areas — livelihood of the daily wage worker, employees & contract workers, preventive health care and will provide timely help to communities in and around various plant locations of the company.
Agarwal joins a growing list of billionaires and industrialists across the world, including Bill Gates and Jack Ma, who have pledged millions to the cause from donating test kits to funding research on vaccines and drugs.
Just a day ago, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra offered the resorts owned by his company to be utilised as temporary care facilities and also announced plans to manufacture ventilators.
