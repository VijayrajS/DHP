A Gulzar poem and Covid appeal: How Bengaluru’s top cop is trying to urge people to stay home
Bengaluru: Bhaskar Rao, Bengaluru’s Police Commissioner, took to poetry to try and convince people to stay indoors after a week-long lockdown between 14 and 22 July was announced by the state government Saturday.
The police commissioner tweeted a poem by Urdu poet Gulzar Sunday — “Bewajah ghar se nikalne ki zarurat kya hai, maut se aankhen milane ki zarurat kya hai (What is the point of going out of your home without reason, what is the need to meet the eyes of death?) — with the caption “Nothing to add”.

Rao, who is fluent in Urdu, told ThePrint that he was an admirer of the renowned poet and could not find a more appropriate way of communicating to the people what they should be doing during the lockdown.
“I have been reading Urdu poetry for the last 40 years. I felt this is a good way to let people know how important it is to stay indoors. Bewajah ghar se nikalne ki zarurat kya hai, maut se aankhen milane ki zarurat kya hai. If people don’t understand this, then I don’t know what else (they) will,” said Rao.
The commissioner has been trying to rally people around the importance of the lockdown and Covid-19 protocols. He has been reaching out to people on Twitter, personally holding meetings across the city and has now tried a more poetic approach.
