Tripura records highest infection rate, Bihar is still the worst performer on testing
New Delhi: India crossed the 16 lakh-mark Friday with 55,078 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 779 deaths in the last 24 hours. In just four days, India saw the total number of cases go up by two lakh, while Friday recorded the highest single-day spike in cases.
In the ThePrint’s daily State Tracker, we take a look at the data on testing and the rate at which the infection is spreading in throughout India.
For this analysis, we use three parameters:
Rt value, known as reproduction number, is indicative of the number of new cases that are expected to emerge from a single case. An R value of less than 1 suggests that the rate of infection is slow since an infected patient will only infect less than one person.
Positivity rate is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. This parameter indicates how widespread the disease is.
Tests per million give insight into the amount of testing being conducted in relation to the population of an area.
All data is sourced from covidtoday.in.
