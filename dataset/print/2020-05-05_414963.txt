Like Bhatt, Mika Aziz also pokes fun at people making a beeline for liquor shops, hinting that they are single-handedly ‘driving’ the economy.
Manjul takes a jibe at the Narendra Modi government for asking migrant workers to pay for their rail fare, whereas Congress offers to fund their tickets.
Sajith Kumar also illustrates ‘Congress cares’ in a veiled contrast to the PM-CARES fund.
R. Prasad also welcomes Congress’ offer to pay for train fare of migrant labourers wanting to go home.
