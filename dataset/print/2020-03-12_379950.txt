But as US TV talk show star, Ellen DeGeneres found out, itâ€™s not only routine life the dreaded virus has infected.
I have some news. For now, Iâ€™ll be shooting my show with no studio audience. To everyone who was looking forward to coming, I'm so sorry. But Iâ€™m doing this for the health of my fans, my staff & my crew. (It has nothing to do with a warrant for my arrest in the state of Florida.)

Who knew itâ€™d take a deadly virus to teach our leaders â€“ even Donald Trump â€” that at the end of the day, weâ€™re all equal?
