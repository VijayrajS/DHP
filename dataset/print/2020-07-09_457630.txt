24,879 new patients, but 19,547 recoveries ensure active cases up by only 5,000 across India
New Delhi: India ramped up testing significantly Wednesday but the positivity rate still remained above 9%. A total of 24,879 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours.
Even as numbers spike every day, the government messaging remains focused on a fuzzy metric called recovery rate. There remained large differences in testing numbers of the high-burden states despite the fact that Delhi is now doing more rapid antigen tests than RTPCR that is considered the gold standard.
Eight states — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat — contribute to around 90% of the active caseload. Moreover, six states — Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal — account for 86% of total deaths, and 32 districts account for 80% deaths.

Close to 25,000 fresh cases and 19,547 recoveries in the last 24 hours ensured that the total active cases went up just by over 5,000.

In the last 24 hours, 2,67,061 tests were conducted. There are currently 1,132 labs comprising 805 in the government sector and 327 in private. There are 603 RT PCR-based testing labs (373 government and 230 private), 435 TrueNat labs (400 government and 35 private) and 94 CBNAAT-based testing labs (33 government and 61 private).

The positivity rate, which is an important metric in deciding the stage of a pandemic and assess the measures taken to control it, remains high despite the increase in testing. Health ministry officials, however, maintain that the high positivity is a function of targeted testing rather than high disease burden.

The number of total deaths that occurred in the last 24 hours stands at 487. This pushed the toll to 21,129 and the case fatality rate to 2.7%.

The number of recovered cases has now overshot that of active Covid cases by 2,06,588. The number of recovered cases is 1.75 times (almost twice) the number of active cases. During the last 24 hours, a total of 19,547 patients have been cured, taking the cumulative figure of recoveries to 4,76,377.

The total cases have now touched 7,67,296. The daily rise has consistently been above 20,000 for the last many days now.

Delhi: Delhi tested substantially more samples using the rapid antigen option than RT PCR. There were 12,567 rapid tests and 9,461 tests using the more time consuming method. It reported 2,033 fresh cases and 48 deaths in the last 24 hours.

Maharashtra: This remains the state with the most number of cases, and it worryingly continues to show a sharp spike. As many as 6,603 cases were reported in the last 24 hours.

Gujarat: The state reported 783 fresh cases and 16 deaths in the last 24 hours. The current mortality rate here is 5.1%.

Tamil Nadu: The state reported 3,756 fresh cases and 64 deaths in the last 24 hours. The total active cases in the state stands at 45,842.
